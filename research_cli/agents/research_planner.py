TOPIC: {topic}

TARGET LENGTH: {target_length} ({length_guidance.get(target_length, length_guidance['medium'])})

Your task is to create a section-by-section plan that will guide the writing process.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Identify 3-5 key research questions this paper should answer
2. Break the topic into logical sections (Introduction, Background, Core Sections, Analysis, Conclusion)
3. For each section, specify:
   - Unique ID (e.g., "intro", "background", "mechanism-design")
   - Clear title
   - 3-5 key points to cover
   - Dependencies (which sections must be written first)
   - Estimated tokens (1500-5000 per section)
   - Depth level ("overview", "detailed", or "comprehensive")

4. Ensure logical flow:
   - Introduction sets context
   - Background establishes foundations
   - Core sections build on each other
   - Analysis synthesizes
   - Conclusion wraps up

5. Consider:
   - What does the reader need to understand first?
   - Which concepts build on others?
   - What level of technical detail is appropriate?
