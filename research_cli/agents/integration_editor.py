RESEARCH TOPIC: {plan.topic}

CURRENT MANUSCRIPT (section-by-section):
{concatenated}

---

YOUR TASK:

Integrate these sections into a polished, coherent research paper.

Integration tasks:
1. Add smooth transitions between sections
   - Bridge paragraphs that connect ideas
   - Forward references (e.g., "We will explore this in Section 4...")
   - Backward references (e.g., "Building on the mechanism described earlier...")

2. Ensure consistency
   - Standardize terminology (e.g., pick one term for each concept and use it consistently throughout — don't alternate between synonyms)
   - Consistent notation and symbols
   - Consistent citation style

3. Add cross-references
   - Link related concepts across sections
   - Reference figures/tables consistently

4. Polish flow
   - Remove redundancy between sections
   - Ensure logical progression
   - Smooth any abrupt transitions

5. Final touches
   - Ensure introduction properly sets up all sections
   - Ensure conclusion synthesizes all sections
   - Add "roadmap" sentences in introduction

Output the complete integrated manuscript in markdown format.

IMPORTANT: Maintain all technical content and depth. Your job is integration and polish, not rewriting."""
