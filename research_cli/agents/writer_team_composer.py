TASK: Propose a research team with complementary expertise.

For the LEAD AUTHOR:
- What primary expertise is most critical for this research?
- What specific focus areas should they have?
- Why are they best suited to lead this research?

- What unique contribution will they make?

IMPORTANT:
- Be specific about expertise — use the narrowest relevant sub-domain:
  CS: "Distributed Consensus Protocols" not just "Distributed Systems"
  Medicine: "Tumor Immunology & Checkpoint Therapy" not just "Oncology"
  Law: "International Trade Law" not just "Law"
  Physics: "Condensed Matter & Topological Insulators" not just "Physics"
  Economics: "Behavioral Finance & Market Microstructure" not just "Finance"
  Humanities: "Post-Colonial Literary Theory" not just "Literature"
  Engineering: "MEMS Sensor Design & Fabrication" not just "Engineering"
- Focus areas should be concrete:
  CS: "BFT consensus under partial synchrony" not just "consensus"
  Medicine: "PD-1/PD-L1 pathway modulation" not just "immune response"
  Economics: "regression discontinuity design in policy evaluation" not just "methods"
- Ensure no overlap between team members
- Each member should have a clear, distinct role
