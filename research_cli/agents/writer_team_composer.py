TASK: Propose a research team with complementary expertise.

- What primary expertise is most critical for this research?
- What specific focus areas should they have?
- Why are they best suited to lead this research?

For each CO-AUTHOR (if any):
- What complementary expertise do they bring?
- What specific focus areas should they cover?
- How do they enhance the research beyond what the lead can do?
- What unique contribution will they make?

IMPORTANT:
- Be specific about expertise (e.g., "Zero-Knowledge Cryptography" not just "Cryptography")
- Focus areas should be concrete (e.g., "zkSNARK proof systems" not just "proofs")
- Ensure no overlap between team members
- Each member should have a clear, distinct role
