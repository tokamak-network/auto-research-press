The taxonomy is reasonable but not novel - similar classifications exist in prior work (Durieux et al., 2020; Perez & Livshits, 2021) which should be acknowledged and differentiated from. The treatment of formal verification is superficial; while Certora and KEVM are mentioned, there's no discussion of the fundamental limitations of formal methods in this domain - specifically the semantic gap between high-level specifications and low-level bytecode, the challenge of modeling the blockchain environment (gas, storage, external calls), and the undecidability results that limit what can be verified. The section on economic testing is promising but underdeveloped - agent-based modeling code snippets are illustrative but there's no discussion of validation of such models against real market behavior. The claim that 'formal verification represents the gold standard' needs qualification; formal verification proves properties about models, not deployed systems, and the specification itself can be wrong. I would recommend restructuring this as either (a) a systematic literature review with proper methodology, or (b) an empirical study comparing testing approaches on real-world vulnerabilities. The current hybrid approach lacks the depth required for either. Additionally, the discussion of mutation testing, metamorphic testing, and differential testing - all relevant techniques for blockchain - is notably absent.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a testing expert perspective, this manuscript makes a solid contribution to the blockchain testing literature by providing a well-structured taxonomy and practical guidance. The systematic literature review methodology (Section 1.3) is commendable and follows established guidelines. The treatment of the test oracle problem (Section 3.2) is particularly valuable, as this fundamental challenge is often glossed over in practitioner-focused materials. However, several issues require attention. First, the empirical evaluation, while useful, needs strengthening - the SmartBugs dataset, while standard, contains relatively simple contracts that may not represent the complexity of modern DeFi protocols with cross-contract interactions and flash loan vectors. The detection rates reported should be contextualized with this limitation. Second, the mutation testing section (2.2.3) correctly identifies the gap between coverage and mutation scores but doesn't provide guidance on achieving adequate mutation coverage or discuss computational costs of mutation testing at scale. Third, the differential testing discussion (2.2.5) is excellent but could benefit from discussing the challenge of maintaining test oracles when all implementations might share the same bug (specification bugs). The economic testing section (Section 6) is a highlight, particularly the model validation table showing error rates against historical data - this kind of empirical grounding is rare in the literature. However, the section ends abruptly mid-sentence, which significantly undermines the manuscript's completeness. Finally, while the manuscript acknowledges formal verification limitations, it could more explicitly address the practical reality that most smart contract vulnerabilities in production have been in code that was audited and sometimes formally verified, suggesting the need for defense-in-depth approaches that the manuscript hints at but doesn't fully develop.",

The addition of confidence intervals, McNemar's test for significance, and explicit discussion of the SmartBugs benchmark's representativeness issues demonstrates mature scientific thinking. The specification gap discussion in Section 3.4 is particularly valuable - the finding that 80% of exploited formally-verified contracts had vulnerabilities outside verified properties is an important contribution that practitioners need to understand.\n\nHowever, the manuscript suffers from an incomplete Section 6, which is especially problematic given that your own data shows economic vulnerabilities account for the majority of DeFi exploits. The agent-based modeling code cuts off mid-implementation, and there's no discussion of how to validate economic models against historical data, how to parameterize agent strategies, or how to interpret simulation results. This section needs substantial expansion.\n\nThe differential testing discussion appropriately notes the specification oracle problem, but could be strengthened with more examples of how this manifests in practice. The mutation testing coverage is good but would benefit from discussion of equivalent mutant detection strategies and how to prioritize mutants for large codebases.\n\nFor the tool evaluation, while I appreciate the transparency about SmartBugs limitations, the promised supplementary analysis of real-world exploited contracts is mentioned but never delivered. Either present these results or remove the reference. Additionally, the claim that Echidna detected 43% of vulnerabilities missed by static analysis needs more context - what types of vulnerabilities, and how does this translate to practical recommendations for tool selection?\n\nThe manuscript would also benefit from a consolidated decision framework or flowchart that synthesizes the various recommendations scattered throughout into actionable guidance for practitioners with different risk profiles and resource constraints.",
