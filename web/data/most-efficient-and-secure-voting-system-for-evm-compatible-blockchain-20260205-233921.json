The gas cost analysis, which should be central to efficiency claims, relies heavily on estimated ranges (e.g., '200,000-500,000 gas' for ZK verification) without specifying proof systems, circuit sizes, or measurement conditions. The claim that 'gas costs can be reduced by 60-85% through batching and layer-2 deployment' in the executive summary is not substantiated with empirical data anywhere in the document. The security analysis, while covering the right properties, lacks formal treatment - for instance, the claim that MACI achieves 'receipt-freeness through key-change mechanism' deserves more rigorous analysis of the conditions under which this holds (e.g., timing assumptions, coordinator behavior). The code examples, while illustrative, contain simplifications that could mislead implementers - the ElGamal homomorphic addition in the EnhancedVoting contract uses addmod which is incorrect for elliptic curve operations. The comparison tables are useful but would benefit from citations to security proofs or audit reports rather than checkmarks. The treatment of emerging technologies (FHE, account abstraction) is appropriately forward-looking but speculative timelines ('2-3 years') should be qualified with technical milestones required. Overall, this reads more as a practitioner's guide than a research contribution, which is valuable but should be positioned accordingly.",

On MEV: the commit-reveal scheme is presented as solving front-running, but this is incomplete\u2014sophisticated attackers can still extract value through mempool observation during the reveal phase, sandwich attacks on vote-dependent token prices, and collusion with block builders to strategically order reveals. The manuscript should analyze private transaction submission mechanisms (Flashbots Protect, MEV Blocker), threshold-encrypted mempools, and the specific MEV risks in each proposed architecture. On Sybil resistance: the ZK-based eligibility verification via Merkle proofs is a cryptographic mechanism, not a Sybil resistance mechanism\u2014it only proves membership in a predefined set without addressing how that set achieves one-person-one-vote or prevents wealth-based Sybil attacks. The manuscript conflates token-weighted voting (explicitly not Sybil-resistant) with identity-based eligibility without adequately distinguishing these threat models. On liveness: the comparison of L2 solutions mentions finality times but ignores censorship resistance entirely. Optimistic rollups with centralized sequencers can trivially censor vote transactions; the 7-day challenge period doesn't help if your vote was never included. The manuscript should discuss forced transaction inclusion mechanisms, escape hatches, and the concrete censorship resistance properties of each recommended deployment target. These omissions are particularly concerning given the manuscript's practical orientation\u2014organizations following these recommendations without understanding these attack vectors could deploy systems vulnerable to sophisticated adversaries.",

          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From a security perspective, this manuscript requires significant strengthening in its treatment of the core voting security properties. The attack resistance matrix in Section 4.1 is misleading: marking commit-reveal as providing protection against 'vote visibility' with a warning symbol obscures the fundamental limitation that all votes become public after the reveal phase. This is not merely 'temporal' privacy\u2014it's a complete failure of ballot secrecy for any threat model where the adversary can wait until after the election. Similarly, the claim that ZK-based systems provide partial protection against vote buying (marked with \u26a0\ufe0f) needs elaboration: without MACI's key-change mechanism, ZK proofs alone do not prevent a voter from proving their vote to a briber by sharing their witness.\n\nThe treatment of MACI's security properties, while generally accurate, understates the trust assumptions. The coordinator learns all votes in plaintext during processing\u2014this is a significant centralization risk that the manuscript acknowledges but doesn't adequately weight in the recommendations. The claim that MACI provides 'receipt-freeness through key-change mechanism' is technically correct but practically limited: if a coercer demands proof of a vote BEFORE the voter has opportunity to change keys, the system fails. The manuscript should discuss timing attacks and the practical constraints on key rotation.\n\nRegarding ZK proof efficiency, the gas cost estimates for verification (200,000-500,000 gas) are reasonable but the manuscript doesn't address the critical issue of proof generation time on client devices. For a voting system to be practical, voters must be able to generate proofs on mobile devices within seconds\u2014this constraint significantly impacts circuit design choices and should inform the recommendation of specific proof systems. The manuscript also doesn't discuss the implications of using Poseidon hash (as in MACI) versus Pedersen commitments for Merkle trees, which has substantial impact on both prover time and verifier gas costs.\n\nThe homomorphic encryption section correctly identifies the gas cost challenges but doesn't explore threshold decryption in sufficient depth. For practical deployment, the key management for threshold Paillier or threshold ElGamal is a critical design consideration that affects both security (what if threshold parties collude?) and liveness (what if threshold parties go offline?). The enhanced voting contract in Section 6.2 uses ElGamal but the security analysis doesn't address the malleability of ElGamal ciphertexts or the need for proof of correct encryption.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from discussing formal verification efforts for voting smart contracts and the specific vulnerabilities that have been found in production systems beyond the Compound incident mentioned.",

The coverage spanning from simple token-weighted voting to advanced MACI implementations is thorough, and the inclusion of real-world case studies (Gitcoin, Compound, Snapshot) grounds the theoretical discussion effectively.\n\nHowever, the reviewers identify several significant gaps that undermine the manuscript's contribution. Most critically, the security analysis lacks rigor in multiple dimensions: (1) the treatment of MEV and transaction ordering attacks is superficial despite their critical importance to voting integrity; (2) the manuscript conflates temporal privacy (commit-reveal) with cryptographic privacy without clarifying that commit-reveal provides zero coercion resistance after the reveal phase; (3) Sybil resistance and liveness/censorship resistance receive inadequate attention despite being fundamental to real-world deployment security. Additionally, the claimed gas cost benchmarks lack empirical validation\u2014the appendix promising measured values is incomplete, and the 60-85% batching reduction claim has no supporting methodology. The novelty scores (5/10 across all reviewers) indicate the work primarily synthesizes existing knowledge without sufficient original contribution.\n\nWhile the manuscript has clear practical value, addressing these gaps requires substantial revision rather than minor corrections.

          "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript represents solid work that will be valuable to practitioners implementing blockchain voting systems. The formal definitions in Section 2.1 are particularly well-crafted and address common misconceptions in the field - for instance, explicitly noting that commit-reveal provides 'temporal privacy only (NOT ballot secrecy per Definition 1)' corrects a widespread misunderstanding. The MACI analysis is notably honest about trust assumptions, which is refreshing given the tendency in blockchain literature to oversell security properties.\n\nHowever, several areas require attention. First, the manuscript's treatment of verifiability needs refinement. The claim that MACI provides universal verifiability is technically correct (the tally proof is publicly verifiable), but the individual verifiability assessment deserves deeper analysis. Under Benaloh's original framework, individual verifiability requires voters to verify their vote was counted without trusting any single party - MACI fails this under coordinator compromise. The manuscript should either adopt a weaker definition explicitly or discuss this limitation more thoroughly.\n\nSecond, the security level discussion for BN254-based Groth16 (~110 bits) is accurate and important, but the implications for long-term security of voting records should be discussed. If votes must remain secret for decades (as in some governmental contexts), the reduced security margin may be unacceptable.\n\nThird, the MEV analysis in Section 5.1 is excellent and addresses a genuinely underexplored area, but it would benefit from discussing the interaction between MEV protection and liveness guarantees - private transaction submission can fail silently, potentially disenfranchising voters.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from a clearer threat model hierarchy. Currently, recommendations are stratified by economic stakes, but the appropriate system also depends on adversary capabilities (nation-state vs. opportunistic attacker) and whether coercion resistance is required. A decision tree or flowchart would help practitioners navigate these tradeoffs.",

The formal security definitions in Section 2.1 are particularly well-crafted and address a genuine gap in how these properties are often conflated in practice. The critical analysis of commit-reveal's limitations regarding coercion resistance is accurate and important - many implementations incorrectly claim privacy properties that commit-reveal cannot provide.\n\nRegarding the gas cost analysis, the measurements appear reasonable and the methodology of using Sepolia testnet is appropriate, though I would strongly recommend including mainnet validation samples given the differences in state size and potential precompile behavior. The amortized MACI cost of ~55,000 gas per vote seems optimistic and should clarify assumptions about batch sizes and voter counts.\n\nThe smart contract upgrade patterns section appears to be missing entirely, which is concerning given it was listed as a focus area. Voting systems have unique upgrade challenges - how do you handle mid-election upgrades? What happens to committed votes if the reveal logic changes? The UUPS vs transparent proxy tradeoffs are particularly relevant here.\n\nFor the on-chain vs off-chain tradeoffs, the manuscript touches on this implicitly but never provides a systematic framework. Key questions remain unaddressed: What's the trust model when vote aggregation happens off-chain? How do you handle data availability for off-chain votes? What are the censorship resistance implications of relying on centralized sequencers for L2 deployments?\n\nThe MACI analysis is thorough but should acknowledge the practical challenges observed in production: coordinator key management complexity, the UX burden of key changes for coercion resistance, and the significant infrastructure requirements. The timing attack vulnerability discussion is valuable but could benefit from quantitative analysis of the timing windows in practice.\n\nFinally, the security level discussion correctly notes BN254's reduced security (~110 bits) but should more strongly recommend BLS12-381 for new deployments, especially given the long-term nature of voting records and potential future cryptanalytic advances.",

The MEV analysis in Section 5.1 is particularly valuable, providing concrete attack scenarios and actionable mitigation recommendations stratified by governance stakes. The formal security definitions in Section 2.1 are rigorous and the explicit distinction between ballot secrecy and coercion resistance addresses a common source of confusion.\n\nHowever, from my review perspective focusing on MEV/transaction ordering, Sybil resistance, and liveness/censorship resistance, several gaps remain. First, the document is clearly incomplete - Section 5.2 cuts off mid-code-block, and the promised analysis of censorship resistance in the threat model (Section 2.4) never materializes in the body. This is a significant omission given that censorship is arguably the most practical attack vector on L2s where most voting will occur.\n\nFor liveness, the manuscript mentions coordinator availability as a MACI trust assumption but doesn't analyze what happens when liveness fails. What are the timeout mechanisms? Can votes be recovered if a coordinator disappears? What participation threshold is needed for commit-reveal schemes to produce valid results? These operational concerns are critical for production deployments.\n\nThe Sybil resistance table is useful but lacks depth. The claim that Worldcoin provides 'High' Sybil resistance deserves scrutiny - what about the orb operator attack surface, biometric spoofing, or the centralized nature of the uniqueness database? Similarly, the interaction between Sybil attacks and the cryptographic layer needs exploration: if an attacker controls 30% of 'unique' identities in a Proof of Humanity registry, how does this propagate through MACI's anti-collusion guarantees?\n\nThe gas measurements and empirical methodology (referenced Appendix A) add credibility, though the appendix itself is not included. The client-side proof generation constraints table is practically valuable for implementers. I recommend completing the missing sections, adding formal liveness definitions and failure mode analysis, and deepening the Sybil resistance economics before this work is ready for publication.",

First, the document is incomplete - it cuts off mid-table in Section 4.2, and the promised sections on MEV exploitation, Sybil resistance propagation, censorship resistance, smart contract upgradeability patterns, and hybrid architectures are missing.

The existing content is generally accurate, though I note the ~110-bit security claim for BN254 should cite the specific Kim-Barbulescu result more precisely (the attack affects the discrete log problem in extension fields, not the elliptic curve discrete log directly). The treatment of verifiability properties is commendable - too many papers in this space conflate ballot secrecy with coercion resistance or claim E2E verifiability for systems that only provide universal verifiability. However, the manuscript would benefit from engaging more deeply with the theoretical foundations. Specifically, the Juels-Catalano-Jakobsson impossibility result (2005) establishes fundamental limits on achieving coercion resistance with receipt-freeness in remote voting settings - this should be discussed. The MACI analysis correctly identifies the coordinator trust assumption but could go further in analyzing the game-theoretic aspects: under what conditions is the coordinator incentivized to behave honestly? The liveness analysis tables are useful but lack formal treatment - what are the actual availability requirements for t-of-n threshold systems? The empirical measurements are valuable but would benefit from statistical characterization (variance, confidence intervals) rather than point estimates. Finally, the manuscript should address post-quantum considerations given that voting systems may need to protect ballot secrecy for extended periods.",

The MACI analysis in Section 3.5 is notably thorough, correctly identifying the tension between coercion resistance and strict E2E verifiability - a nuance often glossed over in promotional materials.\n\nHowever, the manuscript's treatment of the three focus areas (MEV, Sybil resistance, liveness/censorship) is uneven. The Sybil resistance table in Section 2.2 is useful but lacks depth on how identity layer failures propagate to voting security (promised in Section 5.2 but not delivered). The liveness analysis is scattered across sections rather than consolidated, making it difficult to assess the complete threat model.\n\nThe MEV discussion is particularly concerning given its prominence in the research objectives. The attack resistance matrix marks several systems as 'partially protected' against MEV but provides no substantive analysis of what attacks are possible, their economic viability, or mitigation strategies. For commit-reveal specifically, the reveal phase creates a known MEV opportunity where miners/validators can observe reveal transactions and potentially front-run or reorder them - this deserves explicit treatment.\n\nThe truncation is a significant issue that must be resolved before this work can be properly evaluated. The missing sections appear to contain critical analysis that would substantially affect the overall assessment. Additionally, while the empirical measurements are valuable, the methodology appendix is referenced but not included, making it impossible to verify the measurement validity.\n\nFor the censorship resistance analysis, I would recommend examining the specific guarantees provided by different L2 architectures: optimistic rollups with their 7-day challenge periods create different censorship dynamics than ZK rollups with faster finality. The interaction between sequencer centralization (common in current L2 deployments) and vote censorship resistance deserves explicit treatment, particularly given the recommendation to deploy on optimistic rollups in the executive summary.",

        "recommendation": "This survey makes valuable contributions to the blockchain voting literature through its rigorous formal definitions and honest technical analysis. However, the manuscript cannot be accepted in its current truncated state. Authors must complete the missing sections (5-7) and provide the referenced Appendix A. Given the high quality of existing content, we are confident a complete version will meet publication standards. Please submit a complete manuscript addressing the structural incompleteness and the secondary concerns regarding impossibility results and post-quantum considerations. A focused revision addressing these specific issues should be achievable within a standard revision timeline.",
