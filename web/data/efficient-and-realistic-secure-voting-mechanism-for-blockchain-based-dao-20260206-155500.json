          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From a mechanism design perspective, this manuscript reads more as a practitioner survey than a rigorous research contribution. The core weakness is the absence of formal analysis. For instance, when discussing quadratic voting's Sybil vulnerability, the paper correctly identifies that k identities reduce cost from k\u00b2 to k, but doesn't analyze the equilibrium implications: What is the optimal Sybil strategy? How does this interact with identity verification costs? What are the welfare implications? Similarly, the conviction voting section describes the mechanism but doesn't analyze strategic timing of stake allocation, potential manipulation through coordinated stake movements, or the game-theoretic properties of the decay parameter \u03b1.\n\nThe treatment of vote-buying and bribery resistance is particularly underdeveloped given its importance. The paper mentions Votium bribes but doesn't engage with the fundamental impossibility results in the literature (e.g., that any system with verifiable votes enables vote-buying). MACI is presented as a solution, but the coordinator trust assumption is glossed over, and there's no discussion of recent advances like MACI 2.0 or alternative approaches like commit-reveal with economic penalties.\n\nThe delegation analysis misses critical mechanism design questions: How should delegation fees be structured? What prevents delegate capture or vote-selling by delegates? The paper notes concentration but doesn't propose or analyze mechanisms to mitigate it (e.g., delegation caps, quadratic delegation, time-weighted delegation).\n\nFor the reputation-based systems section, the SourceCred model is mentioned but there's no analysis of gaming resistance, reputation inflation, or the cold-start problem. How do you bootstrap reputation in a new DAO? How do you prevent reputation farming through manufactured contributions?\n\nFinally, the comparative analysis table is useful but overly simplistic. 'High/Medium/Low' ratings should be replaced with more precise characterizations, ideally with formal definitions of what constitutes Sybil resistance or plutocracy resistance in each context. The paper would benefit significantly from simulation results or empirical analysis of actual governance outcomes under different mechanisms.",

          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain systems engineering perspective, this manuscript requires significant strengthening in several technical areas. First, the gas efficiency discussion is too high-level. The claim that votes cost '50,000-100,000 gas' obscures critical implementation details. A proper analysis should distinguish between cold vs. warm storage access (21,000 vs 2,900 gas for SLOAD), the cost of checkpoint systems (which can add 20,000+ gas for SSTORE operations), and the overhead of different voting power calculation methods. The Merkle tree voting optimization mentioned deserves deeper treatment - what are the tradeoffs between on-chain commitment size, proof verification costs, and the trust assumptions of the off-chain aggregator? Second, the smart contract security analysis is notably weak for a paper on 'secure' voting mechanisms. There's no discussion of the specific vulnerabilities in governance contracts: how do you prevent reentrancy when a proposal execution calls an external contract that then attempts to vote? What about front-running attacks where miners can observe and front-run vote transactions to manipulate outcomes? The paper mentions timelocks but doesn't analyze the security of timelock implementations themselves, including the risks of admin key compromise or the interaction between timelocks and flash loan attacks (an attacker could potentially queue a malicious proposal and wait out the timelock). Third, the treatment of ZK-based voting (MACI) lacks implementation specifics. What are the actual proving times and gas costs for MACI circuits? The coordinator trust assumption is mentioned but not analyzed - what happens if the coordinator goes offline mid-vote? How do you handle coordinator key rotation? Fourth, the cross-chain governance section is essentially a placeholder. Real engineering analysis would address: How do you handle the case where a vote passes on the source chain but the bridge message fails? What's the attack surface when governance messages traverse multiple bridge hops? How do you reconcile different finality guarantees (Ethereum's ~15 minutes vs. Solana's ~400ms)? Finally, the paper would benefit from actual code analysis of deployed governance contracts. Examining the Governor Bravo implementation, OpenZeppelin's Governor, or Compound's GovernorBravoDelegate would reveal practical security considerations that theoretical analysis misses.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic voting protocols perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening. The security requirements listed in Section 2.2 mix properties at different abstraction levels without formal definitions. In particular, 'privacy' as stated is ambiguous\u2014ballot secrecy (hiding vote content), receipt-freeness (inability to prove how one voted), and coercion-resistance (inability to be coerced even under threat) are distinct properties with different cryptographic requirements. The claim that ZKPs enable 'collusion resistance' in MACI is imprecise: MACI provides a weaker property where voters can change their vote after an initial submission, making bribery verification unreliable, but this is not coercion-resistance in the formal sense since a coercer present during final vote submission can still verify compliance. The manuscript should clarify that MACI requires trusting the coordinator for privacy (not just liveness), as a malicious coordinator can decrypt all votes. The discussion of homomorphic encryption omits critical details: which schemes (Paillier, BFV, BGV)? What are the concrete performance numbers? How is the decryption key managed? The Cicada reference mentions 'homomorphic time-lock puzzles' without explaining the construction or its security assumptions. For a research contribution in this space, I would expect formal security theorems (even if informal proofs), explicit computational assumptions, and comparison against established voting protocol benchmarks. The treatment of verifiability should distinguish between cast-as-intended, recorded-as-cast, and tallied-as-recorded properties. Finally, the manuscript should engage with the fundamental impossibility results in this space\u2014particularly the tension between coercion-resistance and the transparent, immutable nature of blockchain ledgers, which represents a genuine open research challenge that deserves more than passing mention.",

All three reviewers acknowledge the paper's strengths in organization, clarity of presentation, and practical orientation\u2014particularly the effective use of the Beanstalk attack case study and the governance stack diagram. The paper serves as a useful educational resource for practitioners seeking to understand the landscape of DAO governance mechanisms.\n\nHowever, the reviewers unanimously identify a critical gap between the paper's ambitions and its analytical depth. The mechanism design analysis lacks formal game-theoretic rigor (no incentive compatibility proofs, equilibrium characterization, or strategic behavior modeling). The systems engineering perspective is underdeveloped, with superficial gas cost analysis and incomplete smart contract security treatment. Most concerning is the cryptographic analysis, which conflates distinct security properties, provides imprecise definitions, and understates limitations of constructions like MACI. The paper's treatment of fundamental tensions\u2014between transparency and privacy, verifiability and coercion-resistance, Sybil resistance and accessibility\u2014remains at a surface level inappropriate for a research contribution.\n\nThe consensus across reviewers is that this work reads more as an educational overview than a rigorous research contribution. While the practical coverage is valuable, the paper must substantially deepen its formal analysis in at least one of the three dimensions (mechanism design, systems engineering, or cryptographic protocols) to meet publication standards.

The gas analysis is commendable\u2014the breakdown showing SLOAD costs under EIP-2929 and checkpoint binary search overhead reflects real engineering knowledge. However, the treatment of scalability is incomplete. For large voter populations (>10,000), the manuscript should analyze merkle tree-based vote aggregation patterns where individual votes are submitted to an off-chain aggregator and only the merkle root is posted on-chain, reducing per-voter gas costs from ~55k to amortized ~2-5k gas. The Snapshot + SafeSnap pattern deserves detailed analysis as it's the dominant architecture for gas-efficient governance.\n\nThe smart contract code examples are syntactically correct but lack security annotations. The castVote function shown doesn't include reentrancy guards, and while Governor Bravo is generally safe due to state ordering, the manuscript should discuss why and when such guards are necessary. The checkpoint mechanism correctly prevents flash loans but the manuscript doesn't analyze the griefing vector where an attacker can inflate checkpoint array length through frequent small transfers, increasing getPriorVotes gas costs for targeted addresses.\n\nMost critically, the absence of cross-chain governance analysis is a major gap given that most significant DAOs now operate across multiple chains. Uniswap's cross-chain governance through Wormhole, Aave's cross-chain governance module, and the emerging pattern of L1 voting with L2 execution all present unique security challenges including bridge trust assumptions, message replay attacks, and governance timing attacks exploiting cross-chain latency. The manuscript should also address the on-chain vs off-chain computation tradeoff more explicitly\u2014Snapshot's off-chain voting with IPFS storage achieves zero gas cost for voters but introduces availability and censorship concerns that deserve formal analysis.",

The formal definitions in Section 2.2 are largely correct but would benefit from more precise specification - for instance, the ballot secrecy definition should explicitly state assumptions about the tallying authority and whether we're in the computational or information-theoretic setting. The claim that 'no deployed system achieves true coercion-resistance' is accurate but deserves deeper analysis: what are the fundamental barriers? The paper correctly notes the transparency-privacy tension but doesn't adequately explore cryptographic mitigations like commit-reveal schemes with time-locked encryption, or the use of trusted hardware (SGX/TDX) as a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nThe MACI analysis is the strongest cryptographic content but is unfortunately incomplete. The key rotation mechanism provides only weak bribery resistance - a coercer present during the entire voting period can demand the voter not rotate keys, and the voter cannot prove they didn't submit a later rotation. This limitation should be explicitly stated. Additionally, the coordinator in MACI is a single point of failure for privacy; threshold variants exist but aren't discussed.\n\nMost critically, the paper omits several important cryptographic constructions: (1) homomorphic tallying where votes are encrypted and tallied without decryption of individual ballots, (2) verifiable mixnets for anonymizing vote-voter linkages, (3) blind signatures for credential-based voting. The zero-knowledge proof discussion focuses only on MACI's specific construction without broader context of how ZKPs enable verifiable computation in voting (e.g., proving vote validity without revealing the vote). For a paper titled around 'secure voting mechanisms,' the cryptographic coverage is surprisingly narrow. I recommend the authors consult the Handbook of Voting (2022) and recent works on blockchain-based e-voting (e.g., McCorry et al.'s 'A Smart Contract for Boardroom Voting') to strengthen this section substantially.",

However, the analysis would benefit from deeper engagement with mitigation strategies beyond cryptographic privacy\u2014for instance, the literature on commitment devices, vote locking periods, or retroactive voting power adjustments that could increase bribery costs even with transparent votes.\n\nThe Sybil resistance analysis correctly identifies the fundamental tension but presents an overly binary view. Real-world systems like Gitcoin Passport demonstrate that graduated identity verification can provide meaningful Sybil resistance while preserving pseudonymity for most participants. A more nuanced analysis would characterize the Pareto frontier between identity costs, Sybil resistance, and accessibility.\n\nMost critically, the manuscript's treatment of delegation is essentially absent despite delegation being the dominant mode of participation in major DAOs. Empirical data shows that >80% of voting power in protocols like Compound and Uniswap comes through delegation. This creates second-order game-theoretic considerations: delegate selection becomes a meta-game, delegates face different incentive structures than direct voters, and delegation markets (explicit or implicit) can emerge. The bribery analysis should extend to delegate bribery, which may have different equilibrium properties due to delegates' reputational concerns and repeated-game dynamics.\n\nThe conviction voting analysis is solid but should address the tension between time-weighted voting and responsive governance. The mechanism inherently disadvantages proposals responding to urgent situations (security vulnerabilities, market conditions), creating a potential governance attack vector where time-sensitive malicious proposals exploit the slow response of legitimate opposition.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from explicit discussion of how these mechanisms compose\u2014most production DAOs use hybrid systems (e.g., token-weighted voting with delegation, quorum requirements, and timelocks), and the interaction effects between mechanism components deserve formal analysis.",

The gas analysis is commendable - citing specific costs for cold vs warm storage access and including EIP-2929 considerations shows current technical awareness. However, the checkpoint implementation shown uses a standard binary search that could be optimized; there's no discussion of the gas implications of different checkpoint pruning strategies or the tradeoffs between checkpoint granularity and lookup costs.\n\nThe smart contract code examples are production-aware but incomplete. The castVote function correctly uses getPriorVotes for snapshot-based voting, but there's no discussion of the block.number vs block.timestamp debate for snapshots, which has significant implications for L2 deployments where block times differ substantially from mainnet. The checkpoint griefing attack analysis is valuable, but the proposed mitigations (FIFO replacement, interval-based pruning) aren't analyzed for their own security implications - FIFO replacement could enable vote manipulation by forcing out relevant checkpoints.\n\nThe manuscript's treatment of L2 deployments is superficial. While cost comparisons are provided, there's no analysis of the different security models (optimistic vs ZK rollups), finality times and their impact on governance timelocks, or the implications of sequencer centralization for vote ordering. For Arbitrum and Optimism specifically, the sequencer could theoretically front-run or censor governance transactions - this attack vector isn't addressed.\n\nMost critically for a 2024 publication, there's no discussion of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) in governance contexts. Vote transactions can be sandwiched, governance proposals can be front-run, and the interaction between MEV and vote-buying creates complex dynamics that deserve analysis. The Flashbots ecosystem and private mempools have implications for governance privacy that aren't explored.\n\nThe scalability analysis would benefit from concrete numbers on voter population limits. At what point does a single-block vote tally become infeasible? What are the gas limits for proposal execution with complex on-chain actions? These practical constraints shape real DAO architecture decisions but aren't quantified here.",

The proof that quadratic voting degenerates to linear voting without identity costs is well-constructed, and the derived condition for graduated verification to preserve QV benefits (w(l)/w(l') \u2264 \u221a(c(l)/c(l'))) is a useful design criterion. However, several gaps limit the work's completeness as a governance mechanism analysis.\n\nThe treatment of delegation is notably thin given its centrality to real-world DAO governance. The manuscript correctly identifies that delegation concentrates power but doesn't analyze the mechanism design implications: What are the equilibrium properties of delegation markets? Under what conditions do liquid democracy systems converge to representative democracy? How do delegation fees or rewards affect the delegate selection equilibrium? The Votium example actually illustrates a delegation market (bribing veCRV holders who have delegated gauge voting rights), but this connection isn't developed.\n\nThe participation incentive analysis is similarly underdeveloped. The manuscript acknowledges low participation rates but doesn't formally model why rational voters abstain or how mechanism design can address this. The literature on rational ignorance (Downs, 1957) and its application to blockchain governance (e.g., Buterin's writing on voter apathy) should inform a formal treatment of when participation incentives improve welfare versus when they introduce noise from uninformed voting.\n\nOn Sybil resistance, while the individual-level analysis is strong, the manuscript underestimates the threat from coordinated groups. BrightID's social graph analysis, for instance, fails when attackers can create genuine-looking social connections among Sybil identities - a documented attack vector in Gitcoin grants. The formal analysis should distinguish between (1) individual Sybil creation costs, (2) marginal costs for organized groups with existing infrastructure, and (3) costs for nation-state adversaries. The graduated verification framework is promising but needs adversarial analysis against these different threat levels.\n\nFinally, the conviction voting analysis correctly identifies strategic stake timing but doesn't fully explore the mechanism's game-theoretic properties. Specifically: What is the equilibrium participation level? Does conviction voting create incentives for 'always-on' governance participation that may exclude part-time participants? How does the decay parameter \u03b1 affect the tradeoff between responsiveness and manipulation resistance? These questions have direct implications for mechanism parameter selection.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of cryptographic voting protocols, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive treatment. The simulation-based definition of ballot secrecy is correctly formulated, and the acknowledgment that standard blockchain voting provides 'none of these properties' is refreshingly honest. However, several critical gaps remain.\n\nFirst, the formal definitions need tightening. The receipt-freeness definition provided is non-standard - the canonical definition involves the voter's ability to 'fake' a vote to a coercer, not merely produce convincing receipts. The JCJ coercion-resistance definition requires an untappable channel during registration, which is fundamentally incompatible with transparent blockchain registration unless you introduce additional trusted infrastructure (which should be explicitly modeled).\n\nSecond, the manuscript promises analysis of 'zero-knowledge proof constructions for vote validity and tallying' but delivers only high-level descriptions. For MACI specifically, critical questions remain unaddressed: What is the circuit size and proving time? How does the coordinator's private key management affect the trust model? What happens if the coordinator goes offline - is there a recovery mechanism? The claim that MACI provides ballot secrecy should be qualified: it provides secrecy against external observers but the coordinator learns all votes.\n\nThird, the treatment of threshold cryptography is superficial. The manuscript mentions 't-of-n parties must collude' but doesn't specify whether this is computational or information-theoretic security, doesn't discuss the DKG (distributed key generation) requirements, and doesn't analyze the liveness-safety tradeoffs in threshold settings.\n\nThe informal theorem about transparency-privacy incompatibility is valuable but should be stated more precisely. Specifically, the issue is that blockchain transactions are authenticated (signed by the voter's key), creating an inherent link between identity and vote. Time-lock puzzles don't solve this - they only delay revelation. TEEs shift trust to hardware manufacturers. The only cryptographic solution that could work in principle is a proper anonymous credential system with unlinkable showing, but this requires trusted issuance.\n\nFinally, the manuscript should engage more deeply with the end-to-end verifiability literature. The cast-as-intended, recorded-as-cast, tallied-as-recorded decomposition is correct, but the manuscript doesn't analyze how these properties interact with privacy requirements or discuss the Benaloh challenge for cast-as-intended verification in encrypted voting systems.",

Most critically, the cryptographic protocol analysis is incomplete: MACI's ZK-SNARK construction is referenced but not analyzed in detail, verifiable mixnets and homomorphic tallying are mentioned but absent from the main text, and formal security proofs are lacking. The delegation analysis promised in the executive summary ('over 80% of voting power flows through delegates') is not substantively developed despite being central to practical DAO governance. Cross-chain governance receives only superficial treatment. These are not minor omissions\u2014they represent core components that the manuscript claims to cover but does not deliver.\n\nThe average score of 6.9 and the consistency of concerns across reviewers (all noting incomplete coverage of promised content, lack of formal proofs, and underdeveloped sections) indicate that while the foundation is strong, substantial work remains. The novelty scores (5-6 across reviewers) also suggest the manuscript needs to either deepen its analytical contributions or more clearly position itself as a survey with comprehensive coverage\u2014currently it falls between these goals.",

        ],
        "recommendation": "The manuscript has a strong foundation but oversells its coverage in the executive summary relative to what the main text delivers. Authors should either (1) significantly expand the cryptographic protocol analysis, delegation dynamics, and cross-chain governance sections to match the promised scope, or (2) narrow the claimed contributions to match the current depth of analysis. The former path leads to a comprehensive reference work; the latter to a more focused but still valuable contribution. Given the solid technical foundations already present, I recommend the expansion path with particular attention to the cryptographic formalism that Reviewer 3 correctly identifies as incomplete. Include concrete case studies (Beanstalk, Build Finance) to ground theoretical attack vectors, and ensure all mechanisms mentioned in the introduction receive substantive treatment in the body.",
