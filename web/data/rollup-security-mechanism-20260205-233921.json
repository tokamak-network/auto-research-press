The bridge security section (4.3) correctly identifies the importance of canonical bridges but then pivots to discussing non-rollup bridge hacks without deeply analyzing rollup-specific vulnerabilities. For instance, the cross-layer message verification process deserves detailed scrutiny: how do rollups verify that a deposit message on L1 corresponds to a legitimate deposit transaction? What happens if the sequencer observes a deposit event but the L1 transaction is later reorged? The manuscript should analyze the security of message hashing schemes, the handling of L1 reorgs during the deposit flow, and potential vulnerabilities in the event parsing logic. Similarly, the withdrawal mechanism analysis focuses primarily on challenge period length but neglects critical security considerations such as: the economic security of the challenge game under various stake distributions, the implications of withdrawal batching on individual user security, and the trust assumptions introduced by fast withdrawal providers who effectively become trusted intermediaries. The upgrade governance discussion would benefit from quantitative analysis - for example, what is the minimum safe timelock duration given realistic assumptions about community response time and attacker capabilities? The manuscript references L2Beat's Stages framework but doesn't critically examine whether the Stage 1/2 criteria adequately capture upgrade security risks. Finally, while the manuscript mentions emergency intervention mechanisms, it doesn't analyze the fundamental tension between having effective emergency response capabilities and achieving meaningful decentralization - this deserves a dedicated threat model analysis.",

The treatment of validity proofs is particularly concerning\u2014while the paper correctly identifies that ZK-rollups provide 'computational soundness,' it never formally defines what this means in terms of security reductions or concrete security parameters. For instance, when discussing SNARK-based systems, the paper should specify that soundness relies on assumptions like the Knowledge of Exponent Assumption (KEA) or the Algebraic Group Model, and discuss the implications of these assumptions being falsified. The fraud proof analysis similarly lacks depth: the bisection protocol is described procedurally but without analysis of its security properties under adversarial conditions. Key questions remain unaddressed: What happens if the challenger runs out of gas? How does the protocol handle situations where both parties are malicious? What are the exact conditions under which the 1-of-N assumption provides security, and what network synchrony assumptions are required? The paper mentions that 'periods shorter than 5 days may be insufficient' citing Kelkar et al., but this citation appears misattributed (the referenced paper is about order-fairness, not challenge period analysis). The circuit security section identifies important concerns but lacks formal treatment\u2014what does it mean for a circuit to have a 'soundness bug'? This should be formalized in terms of the constraint system admitting satisfying witnesses for invalid statements. Finally, the prover/verifier complexity discussion needs substantial expansion: the security implications of centralized proving extend beyond liveness and censorship to include potential for undetectable proof manipulation if the prover has implementation-level vulnerabilities that aren't caught by the verification circuit.",

          "detailed_feedback": "The manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge of rollup architectures but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive security analysis. Regarding data availability, the treatment of EIP-4844 is particularly thin\u2014while blob transactions are mentioned, there's no discussion of how data availability sampling actually works, what the honest minority assumptions are, or how the 18-day pruning window interacts with the 7-day challenge period for optimistic rollups. This is a critical gap since DA is fundamental to rollup security. The claim that 'Security = min(Ethereum, DA layer security)' for external DA is an oversimplification that ignores the nuanced ways these security guarantees compose.\n\nOn sequencer centralization, the manuscript correctly identifies the risks but provides no formal analysis. What is the expected value of MEV extraction for a malicious sequencer? Under what conditions would a sequencer rationally choose to censor transactions? How do force-inclusion delays interact with time-sensitive DeFi operations? These questions require game-theoretic modeling that is absent from the current work.\n\nThe L1-L2 security inheritance discussion is perhaps the weakest aspect. The manuscript assumes that posting data and proofs to L1 automatically confers L1-level security, but this ignores several subtleties: (1) L1 reorgs can invalidate rollup state that users believed was final, (2) the security of validity proofs depends on cryptographic assumptions that are independent of L1 consensus security, (3) bridge security depends on correct implementation of verification logic, not just L1 finality. A rigorous treatment would define a formal security model specifying exactly which L1 properties are inherited and under what assumptions.\n\nThe references, while appropriate, are somewhat dated and miss recent academic work on rollup security formalization. The practical evaluation framework is useful but would benefit from connection to formal verification efforts and existing security audit methodologies. Overall, this is a competent survey that would benefit significantly from deeper analytical treatment of its core claims.",

All reviewers praised the comprehensive taxonomy, clear presentation, and practical utility of the security evaluation framework. However, they unanimously identified a pattern of superficial treatment where deeper analysis is warranted\u2014the manuscript describes security mechanisms but often fails to formally analyze them.\n\nThe most significant concerns center on three areas. First, the cryptographic and formal foundations are underdeveloped: security properties are stated without formal definitions, security games, or reduction arguments. Second, critical security-relevant topics receive inadequate depth, including bridge contract vulnerabilities, withdrawal mechanism attacks, data availability sampling guarantees, and sequencer centralization risks. Third, the claimed L1-L2 security inheritance is asserted rather than rigorously defined and proven. The novelty scores (5-6 across reviewers) also indicate that the manuscript synthesizes existing knowledge without contributing new theoretical insights or empirical findings.\n\nDespite these limitations, the reviewers recognize the manuscript's potential value as a comprehensive reference.

The formal security definitions in Sections 2.1.1 and 3.1.1 are a good start, but the soundness and completeness properties for fraud proofs need tighter specification - particularly around the computational model and what 'PPT adversary' means in the context of interactive protocols with timing constraints. The cryptographic assumptions table in Section 3.1.2 is concerning in its brevity: the Knowledge of Exponent Assumption (KEA) is labeled 'non-standard' without discussing the implications of its potential falsification beyond a single sentence, and the Algebraic Group Model's limitations in capturing real-world attacks deserve deeper treatment. The manuscript correctly identifies that STARK security relies on collision-resistant hash functions, but doesn't address the concrete security bounds or how the hash function instantiation affects the overall security level. The prover centralization analysis in Section 3.4 identifies risks but doesn't formally model the security degradation - what exactly can a malicious prover do given current architectures? The claim that 'soundness is preserved' in proof markets needs justification: while proofs are verified on-chain, a malicious prover could potentially exploit timing, submit proofs for reorged transactions, or engage in selective proving that affects liveness in security-critical ways. The bridge security section is practically useful but the formal security composition claim that 'Security = min(Ethereum consensus, DA layer, Proof system)' is an oversimplification that could mislead practitioners - security composition in layered systems is rarely a simple minimum function and depends critically on the specific properties being composed.",

First, the document is clearly incomplete - Section 4.3.2 ends mid-sentence with an empty table, and the promised analysis of 'upgrade governance risks and emergency intervention mechanisms' from the abstract is entirely missing. This is a significant gap given that upgrade mechanisms represent one of the most critical trust assumptions in current rollup deployments. Second, while the challenge period analysis in Section 2.3 is reasonable, it lacks formal treatment of the economic security bounds - what is the minimum stake required to make fraud proof submission incentive-compatible? How do gas price fluctuations affect the security guarantees? Third, the bridge security analysis, while comprehensive in identifying vulnerability classes, would benefit from a systematic threat model that considers different adversary capabilities (sequencer compromise vs. external attacker vs. governance attack). The cross-layer reentrancy discussion is valuable but could be strengthened with formal invariants that secure bridges should maintain. Finally, the paper would benefit from a clearer distinction between theoretical security properties and the current state of deployed systems - many rollups operate with training wheels (security councils, upgrade keys) that fundamentally alter the trust model from what the theoretical analysis suggests.",

The formalization efforts are commendable - the security games for fraud proof soundness, the formal definitions of circuit vulnerabilities, and the quantitative analysis of challenge period adequacy all demonstrate rigorous thinking. However, several issues require attention before this work reaches publication quality.\n\nThe most pressing concern is completeness - the manuscript is clearly truncated, with an empty table in Section 4.3.2 and missing sections that were promised in the introduction (forward-looking analysis, actionable recommendations). This makes comprehensive review impossible.\n\nRegarding the specific focus areas requested: The data availability sampling treatment is strong, with proper formalization of security bounds and good discussion of the interaction between blob pruning windows and challenge periods. However, the sequencer centralization analysis, while identifying the risks well, could go deeper on censorship resistance mechanisms - the force-inclusion analysis is good but doesn't fully address scenarios where L1 itself faces congestion or censorship pressure. Most notably, the L1-L2 security inheritance model needs substantial strengthening. The manuscript states rollups 'inherit' L1 security but doesn't rigorously define what this means. Key questions remain unaddressed: What happens to rollup security during L1 reorgs beyond the finality threshold? How do different L1 finality assumptions (Ethereum's LMD-GHOST vs. Casper FFG finality) affect rollup security properties? What are the formal conditions under which the security composition formula presented actually holds?\n\nThe novelty score reflects that this is primarily a synthesis work rather than presenting new theoretical results or empirical findings. This is acceptable for a survey paper, but the contribution would be strengthened by original analysis - perhaps formal verification of specific protocol implementations or novel attack vector identification.",

The formalization of the bisection protocol security proof and the detailed treatment of cryptographic assumptions are particularly valuable contributions. However, several areas warrant attention for a complete security analysis.\n\nThe treatment of bridge contracts is notably thin given their historical significance as attack vectors (Ronin, Wormhole, Nomad bridges collectively lost over $1B). The manuscript should formalize the security properties required for cross-layer message passing, including message ordering guarantees, replay protection mechanisms, and the trust assumptions in message relayers. The current discussion of L1-L2 security inheritance would benefit from explicit treatment of how bridge contract vulnerabilities can break the security inheritance model.\n\nThe withdrawal mechanism analysis, while including useful economic considerations, lacks formal treatment of the withdrawal proof verification process itself. Questions such as: What happens if a withdrawal proof references a state root that gets challenged? How do fast withdrawal providers verify proof validity before fronting funds? What are the exact conditions under which a withdrawal can be censored or delayed? These deserve rigorous analysis.\n\nThe upgrade governance section is particularly underdeveloped relative to its importance. The Security Council mechanisms mentioned for Arbitrum and Optimism represent significant trust assumptions that could override the cryptographic and economic security guarantees analyzed elsewhere. A formal threat model for upgrade mechanisms\u2014including analysis of timelock adequacy, multisig compromise scenarios, and the tension between emergency response capability and decentralization\u2014would strengthen the manuscript considerably.\n\nThe empirical data sources are well-documented, which is commendable. However, the manuscript would benefit from sensitivity analysis on key parameters\u2014for instance, how do the security conclusions change if L1 censorship resistance degrades due to validator concentration trends?\n\nFinally, the abrupt truncation suggests this is incomplete work. The circuit vulnerability case study was building toward important conclusions that are now missing.

However, several areas warrant deeper investigation. First, the soundness analysis for ZK-rollups should address the concrete security of deployed systems more rigorously - for instance, what is the actual soundness error when accounting for the number of proofs verified over the system's lifetime? The birthday bound implications for systems processing millions of proofs deserve attention. Second, the manuscript would benefit from analyzing composition security: when multiple rollups share infrastructure (sequencers, provers, bridges), how do correlated failures affect the aggregate security? Third, the economic security analysis for fraud proofs, while useful, doesn't adequately address the game-theoretic equilibria - specifically, under what conditions might rational challengers coordinate to not challenge (e.g., if challenging reveals profitable MEV strategies)? The KEA assumption discussion is valuable but should note recent work on falsifiable alternatives and their applicability to deployed systems.

The treatment of optimistic rollup fraud proofs is particularly well-done, with the bisection protocol proof being mathematically rigorous and the economic analysis providing actionable insights.

First, the manuscript is incomplete - it cuts off during the circuit vulnerability case study, and critical topics promised in the scope (data availability sampling, sequencer centralization, L1-L2 finality) are not adequately covered. The data availability section is especially important given its centrality to rollup security; the current treatment is superficial.\n\nSecond, while the formal models are sound, some claims need qualification. The 1-of-N honest assumption analysis should more explicitly address the distinction between theoretical and practical honest parties - having one honest observer is different from having one honest observer with sufficient capital, infrastructure, and incentive to challenge. The economic analysis begins this but doesn't fully connect to the formal model.\n\nThird, the treatment of ZK-rollup prover centralization is mentioned but not analyzed in depth. Given that most ZK-rollups currently have single provers, this represents a significant trust assumption that deserves formal treatment similar to the sequencer analysis for optimistic rollups.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from a threat model taxonomy that clearly distinguishes between: (1) cryptographic attacks on proof systems, (2) economic attacks on incentive mechanisms, (3) operational attacks on infrastructure, and (4) governance attacks on upgrade mechanisms.
