          "detailed_feedback": "From a Layer 2 ecosystem and scaling tradeoffs perspective, this manuscript makes valuable contributions but requires strengthening in several key areas. The treatment of based rollups as a distinct architectural choice is well-motivated, but the comparative analysis falls short of the rigor needed to guide protocol designers and researchers. Specifically, the comparison table in Section 4.2 provides useful high-level distinctions but lacks the quantitative depth necessary for meaningful evaluation. For instance, stating that shared sequencers offer '~1-2 seconds' confirmation versus '~12 seconds' for based rollups obscures important nuances: what are the actual distributions? How do these change under congestion? What are the security assumptions underlying each latency figure?\n\nThe cross-rollup composability discussion is particularly underdeveloped given its importance. The manuscript correctly notes that 'different based rollups may have transactions in the same L1 block but cannot atomically interact,' but fails to explore the implications for DeFi protocols that rely on atomic arbitrage, liquidations, or multi-venue trading. This is a fundamental limitation that affects the practical utility of based rollups for the most economically significant L2 use cases. The claim that 'shared sequencer networks potentially offer superior cross-L2 properties' deserves rigorous analysis rather than a passing mention.\n\nThe throughput analysis also requires refinement. The manuscript focuses heavily on latency (12-second block times) but inadequately addresses throughput constraints. Under based sequencing, L2 throughput is bounded by L1 block space allocation, blob data limits, and the efficiency of batch compression. With EIP-4844 providing approximately 375 KB of blob space per block (target), what is the theoretical maximum TPS for a based rollup? How does this compare to centralized sequencers that can batch more aggressively? These questions have significant implications for scaling tradeoffs that the manuscript should address.\n\nFinally, the discussion of preconfirmations as a latency mitigation is promising but lacks critical analysis of the trust assumptions involved. Preconfirmations from validators introduce new attack vectors (validator collusion, preconfirmation withholding) that partially undermine the censorship resistance benefits of based sequencing. A more rigorous treatment would analyze the security-latency tradeoff curve as preconfirmation mechanisms are introduced.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a consensus mechanisms and MEV economics perspective, this manuscript captures the high-level architecture correctly but misses critical nuances that would be essential for researchers or practitioners evaluating based rollups. The claim that based rollups achieve 'censorship resistance equivalent to the underlying L1' (Section 3.1) requires more careful qualification\u2014while true for eventual inclusion, the practical censorship resistance depends heavily on builder market dynamics. With 80% of blocks built by 3 builders, short-term censorship of L2 transactions is significantly easier than L1 censorship, as builders could simply not include L2 batches without violating any protocol rules. The manuscript mentions this in Section 7.3 but fails to connect it to the earlier censorship resistance claims.\n\nThe MEV analysis is particularly weak given its centrality to the based rollup thesis. The manuscript correctly notes that MEV flows to L1 validators/builders but does not analyze the implications for L2 transaction ordering fairness. Under based sequencing, L2 transactions enter the L1 builder's optimization problem, meaning L2 users are exposed to the same MEV extraction dynamics as L1 users\u2014this is a significant change from centralized sequencers that could implement fair ordering policies. The manuscript should discuss whether this is a feature (alignment with L1) or a bug (worse UX than possible alternatives).\n\nThe preconfirmation treatment is the most significant gap. The manuscript presents preconfirmations as a solution to latency concerns but does not rigorously analyze their trust assumptions. Key questions left unaddressed: What collateral must proposers post? How is slashing enforced for preconfirmation violations? What happens if a proposer commits to conflicting preconfirmations? How do preconfirmations interact with reorgs? The reference to 'production-ready preconfirmation systems expected 2025-2026' is speculative and should be supported by concrete research milestones. Additionally, the manuscript should discuss the relationship between preconfirmations and Ethereum's evolving inclusion list proposals, as these mechanisms interact in complex ways.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a rollup architecture and data availability perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational understanding but falls short of the technical rigor expected for a comprehensive research report. The most significant gap concerns EIP-4844 integration: the report mentions blobs but fails to address critical implementation considerations. Based rollups posting data via blobs must contend with the blob gas market's distinct pricing mechanism, where blob base fees can spike independently of execution gas costs. The 4096-epoch retention window means based rollups must implement robust data availability strategies\u2014either maintaining their own blob archival infrastructure or relying on third-party DA providers for historical reconstruction. The report should discuss how the ~18-day blob availability window interacts with optimistic rollup challenge periods (typically 7 days) and what happens if blob data becomes unavailable before challenges complete.\n\nThe state derivation discussion is particularly thin given its centrality to based rollup operation. Unlike traditional rollups where the sequencer provides a canonical ordering, based rollups derive state entirely from L1 block contents. This requires careful specification of: which L1 transactions constitute valid L2 batches, how deposit transactions from L1 bridge contracts are ordered relative to L2 user transactions, and how the derivation pipeline handles L1 reorgs that may invalidate previously derived L2 state. The OP Stack's derivation specification provides a useful reference model that should be analyzed.\n\nRegarding proof systems, the manuscript correctly identifies that both optimistic and ZK approaches are compatible with based sequencing, but misses important nuances. For ZK-based rollups like Taiko, the proof generation timeline creates interesting dynamics: proofs must attest to state transitions derived from L1 blocks, but those L1 blocks may not yet be finalized when proofs are generated. The multi-prover architecture mentioned deserves deeper analysis of how prover competition interacts with L1 block timing. For optimistic based rollups, the fraud proof system must be carefully designed since there's no centralized sequencer to hold accountable\u2014the report should clarify who can be challenged and what collateral is at stake.\n\nThe simplified Solidity snippet in Section 2.3 contains a conceptual issue: `require(msg.sender == block.coinbase)` would restrict batch submission to the block proposer, but under PBS the proposer and builder are separated, and the actual block construction happens off-chain. This needs clarification regarding how based rollup batch inclusion actually works within the MEV-Boost/PBS pipeline.",

The cross-rollup composability section correctly identifies limitations but doesn't explore emerging solutions like shared validity proofs, cross-rollup message passing protocols, or how based rollups might integrate with intent-based architectures that abstract away the composability problem at the application layer. The comparison with validiums is particularly weak - StarkEx is mentioned but the broader design space of volitions (user-chosen DA) and the tradeoffs between security and throughput in the DA layer deserve more attention.

The treatment of L1 proposer-based sequencing correctly identifies the key insight that based rollups delegate ordering authority to L1 proposers via the PBS pipeline, and the censorship resistance analysis appropriately distinguishes between short-term (builder-level) and long-term (validator-level) guarantees. However, the manuscript significantly underdelivers on preconfirmation mechanisms, which are arguably the most important innovation enabling practical based rollup deployment. Without preconfs, the 12-second minimum latency makes based rollups unsuitable for most DeFi applications. The manuscript should analyze protocols like mev-commit that enable proposers to make credible commitments about future block contents, the slashing conditions that enforce these commitments, and the trust assumptions users must make when relying on preconfs versus waiting for L1 inclusion. On MEV economics, while the comparison table correctly notes that MEV flows to L1 validators/builders rather than L2 operators, there's no quantitative analysis of what this means economically. Arbitrum and Optimism currently capture significant MEV revenue that funds development and operations - how do based rollups sustain themselves without this revenue? The manuscript mentions 'diminished MEV capture for L2 operators' but doesn't explore the magnitude or implications. Additionally, the analysis should consider how based rollup adoption affects the MEV supply chain: does it increase total extractable value (via cross-domain MEV opportunities) or merely redistribute existing value? The builder inclusion incentive question deserves more rigorous treatment - the manuscript assumes builders will include L2 batches but doesn't model why this is economically rational given the opportunity cost of blob space and the competitive dynamics of the builder market.",

The treatment of EIP-4844 integration is particularly strong, correctly noting the blob retention window constraints and their implications for fraud proof timing. However, several areas require deeper technical specification. First, the batch submission architecture (Section 2.3.3) shows a simplified contract but doesn't address how builders actually construct valid batches - specifically, the coordination required between the rollup's derivation rules and the builder's batch construction logic. The `verifyBlobData` function is hand-waved when in reality this involves the point evaluation precompile at address 0x0A and requires careful handling of the blob versioned hash verification. Second, the state derivation section, while improved from what appears to be an earlier version, still lacks specification of edge cases: what happens when L1 blocks contain multiple valid batches from different submitters? The manuscript states batch submission is permissionless but doesn't specify the conflict resolution mechanism. Third, the proof system analysis for ZK-based rollups underestimates the complexity of proof generation timing. Current ZK provers (e.g., Taiko's multi-tier proving with SGX fallback) take 10-30 minutes for proof generation, which is well after L1 finality - this actually simplifies the reorg concern but introduces different challenges around proof economics and liveness. The manuscript should clarify that 'eager proving' as described isn't practically implemented by any production system. Finally, the data availability analysis should address the emerging concern of 'blob space as a scarce resource' - with Dencun live, we're already seeing blob fee spikes during high-activity periods, and based rollups have no priority access to blob space unlike rollups with dedicated sequencers that can implement sophisticated blob fee strategies.",

The preconfirmation section is the strongest contribution, with the mev-commit architecture and collateralization requirements being particularly well-specified. However, the trust assumptions need more rigorous treatment: what happens when a preconfirmation provider's stake is insufficient to cover correlated failures across multiple commitments? The blob space contention analysis is valuable but should be extended to consider strategic behavior - large rollups might intentionally congest blob space to disadvantage smaller competitors. Most critically, the MEV economics section needs substantial expansion. The claim that based rollups 'diminish MEV capture for L2 operators' understates the complexity: MEV doesn't disappear, it redistributes to L1 builders/proposers. This creates a fundamental question about L2 operator business models and whether based rollups can sustain development without MEV revenue. The manuscript should also address cross-domain MEV opportunities unique to based rollups - atomic L1/L2 arbitrage becomes possible, potentially creating new MEV categories that don't exist in centralized sequencer models. Finally, the censorship resistance claims require more nuanced treatment given current builder market concentration.",

Third, the blob retention analysis correctly identifies the 18-day window but doesn't explore the implications for long-running fraud proof disputes or the emerging ecosystem of blob archival services.

However, the manuscript's treatment of the broader L2 landscape is disappointingly shallow. Section 1.1 lists rollup categories but never returns to systematically compare them with based rollups. A critical missing piece is the composability analysis: based rollups inherit L1 block times for cross-rollup atomic transactions (when both are based), which is actually a potential advantage over heterogeneous sequencer designs where cross-rollup atomicity requires complex bridging. This should be explored. Conversely, the latency disadvantage means that based rollups may struggle to support high-frequency trading applications that have migrated to faster L2s - this tradeoff deserves quantitative treatment. The preconfirmation section is strong but should connect more explicitly to how preconfirmed transactions interact with cross-rollup operations. The throughput analysis is also incomplete: while blob contention is discussed, there's no systematic treatment of the TPS ceiling under various scenarios or comparison with validium-mode alternatives that could offer escape valves during congestion. The manuscript would benefit from a clear positioning of based rollups within the design space: they appear optimal for applications prioritizing censorship resistance and Ethereum alignment over raw performance, but this conclusion should emerge from rigorous comparative analysis rather than assertion.",

Authors must prioritize: (1) completing all truncated sections\u2014this is non-negotiable, (2) adding the builder centralization analysis to substantiate censorship resistance claims, and (3) strengthening comparative analysis with a structured comparison framework. If empirical data from Taiko deployments is available, including latency/throughput benchmarks would significantly strengthen the contribution. The MEV economics gap can be partially addressed with a focused discussion of value flow implications, even if full quantitative modeling is deferred to future work. Address these issues and the manuscript will be ready for publication.",
