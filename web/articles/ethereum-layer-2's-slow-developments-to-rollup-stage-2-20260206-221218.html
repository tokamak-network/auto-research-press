## Executive Summary

The Ethereum ecosystem has witnessed unprecedented growth in Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, with rollups emerging as the dominant paradigm for transaction throughput enhancement. However, a critical examination of the current landscape reveals a significant disparity between the theoretical promise of rollup technology and its practical implementation. As of mid-2025, no major Ethereum rollup has achieved Stage 2 maturity—the classification denoting full decentralization and trustlessness—despite years of development and billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL).

This research report provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the delayed progression toward Rollup Stage 2, examining technical challenges, economic incentives, governance complexities, and security considerations. Drawing on L2Beat's staging framework, protocol documentation, formal verification research, and empirical data from major rollups including Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Starknet, and Base, we identify systemic patterns that explain the current state of L2 development.

Our analysis reveals that the slow progression stems from a confluence of factors: the inherent complexity of fraud and validity proof systems, insufficient formal verification coverage of critical smart contracts, the tension between security and operational flexibility, principal-agent problems between development teams and users, coordination failures among competing rollups, and the absence of compelling market pressures for full decentralization. We argue that while the current Stage 0 and Stage 1 implementations provide meaningful scaling benefits, they fundamentally compromise the trust assumptions that underpin Ethereum's value proposition.

The report concludes with an assessment of potential pathways toward Stage 2 achievement, including technological innovations, governance mechanism designs, and market-driven incentives. We project that the first Stage 2 rollups may emerge in late 2025 or 2026, though widespread adoption of fully decentralized L2s remains a multi-year endeavor contingent on formal verification progress and demonstrated bug-free operation periods.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Context

Ethereum's transition from a monolithic blockchain to a rollup-centric roadmap represents one of the most significant architectural shifts in blockchain history. Articulated by Vitalik Buterin in 2020, this vision positioned rollups as the primary scaling solution, with the Ethereum mainnet serving as a secure data availability and settlement layer (Buterin, 2020). The subsequent years have validated this approach in terms of adoption metrics: by Q1 2025, Ethereum L2s collectively process over 50 transactions per second (TPS) compared to mainnet's approximately 15 TPS, with combined TVL exceeding \$45 billion across major protocols.

However, quantitative success in transaction throughput and capital attraction obscures a qualitative deficiency in decentralization. The L2Beat staging system, introduced in 2023 to provide standardized maturity assessments, classifies rollups across three stages based on their trust assumptions and decentralization properties. As of May 2025, no rollup with significant TVL has achieved Stage 2 classification, and the majority remain at Stage 0 or Stage 1.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This report addresses the following research questions:

1. What technical, economic, and governance factors explain the delayed progression toward Rollup Stage 2?
2. How do different rollup architectures (optimistic vs. zero-knowledge) face distinct challenges in achieving full decentralization?
3. What are the security implications of operating at Stage 0 and Stage 1?
4. What role do formal verification and audit practices play in Stage 2 readiness?
5. What pathways exist for accelerating the transition to Stage 2, and what timeline is realistic given historical bug discovery patterns?

### 1.3 Methodology

Our analysis synthesizes data from multiple sources: L2Beat's rollup tracking infrastructure, protocol governance forums and documentation, academic literature on rollup security, formal verification tool documentation and coverage reports, historical vulnerability disclosures, and empirical transaction data from Dune Analytics and similar platforms. We employ a comparative framework examining the five largest rollups by TVL: Arbitrum One, Optimism, Base, zkSync Era, and Starknet.

## 2. The L2Beat Staging Framework: Definitions and Criteria

### 2.1 Stage Classification System

L2Beat's staging framework provides a standardized taxonomy for assessing rollup maturity. The three stages correspond to progressively stronger trust assumptions:

**Stage 0 (Full Training Wheels):**
- The rollup operates with significant centralized components
- A security council or operator can unilaterally upgrade contracts
- Users cannot independently exit without operator cooperation
- Fraud/validity proofs may be incomplete or non-functional

**Stage 1 (Limited Training Wheels):**
- A functional proof system exists and is enforced on-chain
- Users can exit without operator permission (escape hatch mechanism)
- Upgrades require a security council with at least 6/8 multisig
- A minimum 7-day delay exists for non-emergency upgrades
- The security council can only intervene in case of proven bugs

**Stage 2 (No Training Wheels):**
- The proof system is fully functional and battle-tested
- Users have unconditional exit rights
- Upgrades require either a 30-day delay or are governed by on-chain governance with adjudication mechanisms
- No security council override capability for normal operations
- The system operates trustlessly with Ethereum-equivalent security

### 2.2 Current Distribution of Major Rollups

As of May 2025, the staging distribution among major rollups reveals the industry's immaturity:

| Rollup | Type | TVL (USD) | Stage | Key Limitations |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Arbitrum One | Optimistic | \$18.2B | Stage 1 | 9-of-12 Security Council with instant upgrade capability, 8-day upgrade delay for non-emergency |
| Base | Optimistic | \$12.1B | Stage 0 | Fault proofs deployed but Security Council retains override, Coinbase-controlled sequencer |
| Optimism | Optimistic | \$8.7B | Stage 1 | Guardian role with Security Council override, permissioned fault proof submission |
| zkSync Era | ZK | \$4.8B | Stage 0 | Centralized prover, PLONK trusted setup dependency, no permissionless escape hatch |
| Starknet | ZK | \$2.1B | Stage 0 | Centralized SHARP prover, operator-controlled forced transaction mechanism |

*Data source: L2Beat, May 2025*

The concentration of TVL in Stage 0 and Stage 1 systems—representing over \$45 billion in user assets—underscores the systemic nature of the decentralization deficit.

## 3. Technical Barriers to Stage 2 Achievement

### 3.1 Optimistic Rollup Challenges

#### 3.1.1 Fraud Proof System Complexity

Optimistic rollups derive their security from the assumption that at least one honest validator will submit a fraud proof if an invalid state transition is proposed. However, implementing production-grade fraud proof systems has proven extraordinarily complex.

**Arbitrum's BOLD Protocol:**

Arbitrum's fraud proof system has undergone significant architectural evolution. The original "Arbitrum Classic" system used interactive dispute resolution with a single challenger, creating vulnerabilities to delay attacks where malicious actors could extend dispute periods by repeatedly challenging honest assertions.

The BOLD (Bounded Liquidity Delay) protocol, deployed in 2024, represents a fundamental redesign addressing these limitations:

1. **All-vs-all dispute resolution**: Unlike the original one-vs-one interactive game, BOLD enables multiple challengers to participate simultaneously, preventing delay attacks through parallel dispute processing.

2. **Permissionless bonding**: Any party can participate in disputes by posting a bond (approximately 3,600 ETH for top-level assertions), with bonds slashed for incorrect challenges and returned plus rewards for successful ones.

3. **Bounded delay guarantees**: The protocol mathematically bounds the maximum dispute resolution time regardless of adversarial behavior, ensuring predictable finality.

4. **Multi-level bisection**: Disputes are resolved through hierarchical bisection across block, batch, and instruction levels, with final resolution at the WAVM (WebAssembly Virtual Machine) instruction level.

Despite BOLD's sophistication, Arbitrum retains its 9-of-12 Security Council with instant upgrade capability, precluding Stage 2 classification. The council includes named entities such as Offchain Labs, Consensys, and several prominent community members, providing accountability but also centralization.

**Optimism's Fault Proof System:**

Optimism deployed its fault proof system (formerly "cannon") to mainnet in mid-2024, enabling the network to achieve Stage 1 classification. The system uses a similar bisection approach but with distinct architectural choices:

1. **MIPS-based execution**: Unlike Arbitrum's WAVM, Optimism's fault proofs execute disputed transactions in a MIPS virtual machine, chosen for its simplicity and extensive tooling.

2. **Modular dispute game**: The OP Stack implements dispute resolution as pluggable "game" contracts, theoretically enabling different dispute mechanisms for different use cases.

3. **Permissioned proposers**: As of May 2025, fault proof submission remains permissioned to a set of approved proposers, a key Stage 2 blocker.

The technical challenges common to both systems include:

1. **Instruction-level determinism**: The fraud proof system must reproduce exact execution results for arbitrary EVM transactions, requiring bit-perfect determinism across different execution environments. Any divergence between L2 execution and L1 verification creates potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Gas metering accuracy**: Discrepancies in gas calculation between L2 execution and L1 verification can create exploitable edge cases where transactions execute differently on each layer.

3. **Timeout and incentive calibration**: The challenge period (7 days for Stage 1, effectively longer with BOLD's bounded delays) must balance security against capital efficiency, while challenger incentives must outweigh griefing costs.

**Base's Fault Proof Status:**

Base, built on the OP Stack, has deployed fault proofs to production as of mid-2024, contrary to earlier reports. However, the Security Council retains override capability, and Coinbase maintains operational control over the sequencer and upgrade processes. Base's progression to Stage 1 requires removing instant upgrade capabilities and demonstrating the fault proof system's reliability over an extended period.

#### 3.1.2 Sequencer Decentralization

All major optimistic rollups operate with centralized sequencers, creating a single point of failure for transaction ordering and inclusion. While sequencer centralization does not compromise fund security (users can always exit via L1 through forced inclusion mechanisms), it introduces:

- **Soft censorship vulnerability**: A malicious or coerced sequencer can delay transactions, though cannot permanently exclude them due to L1 forced inclusion
- **Hard censorship risk**: Without functional forced inclusion, sequencers could permanently exclude transactions
- **MEV extraction**: Centralized sequencers capture maximal extractable value without competition
- **Liveness dependency**: Sequencer downtime halts L2 transaction processing (though not withdrawals)

**Sequencer Decentralization Approaches:**

Several approaches are under active development:

1. **Shared sequencing (Espresso, Astria)**: Third-party decentralized sequencer networks offer ordering services to multiple rollups. Trade-offs include cross-rollup MEV implications, latency increases, and dependency on additional trust assumptions.

2. **Based sequencing**: Ethereum L1 proposers order L2 transactions, inheriting L1's decentralization properties. This approach sacrifices L2 pre-confirmation speed but provides strong censorship resistance guarantees.

3. **Timeboost (Arbitrum)**: A mechanism allowing users to bid for priority ordering within sequencer batches, introducing competition while maintaining a single sequencer operator.

4. **Rotating sequencer sets**: Proof-of-stake style sequencer selection among a permissioned or permissionless validator set.

Each approach involves trade-offs between decentralization, latency, MEV distribution, and implementation complexity. Notably, Stage 2 does not strictly require sequencer decentralization if robust forced inclusion mechanisms exist, though centralized sequencing remains a practical concern for user experience.

### 3.2 Zero-Knowledge Rollup Challenges

#### 3.2.1 Prover Infrastructure Complexity

ZK rollups face distinct technical barriers centered on proof generation and verification. The computational requirements for generating validity proofs remain substantial, and the cryptographic assumptions underlying different proof systems affect decentralization pathways.

**zkSync Era's Architecture:**

zkSync Era employs PLONK-based proofs with KZG polynomial commitments, offering efficient verification but requiring a trusted setup ceremony. Key characteristics include:

- **Proof generation**: Batches of transactions require specialized GPU hardware, with proof generation taking 10-20 minutes for typical batches
- **Trusted setup dependency**: The KZG commitment scheme requires a trusted setup; while zkSync participated in Ethereum's KZG ceremony, this introduces a cryptographic assumption absent from transparent proof systems
- **Prover centralization**: Matter Labs operates the sole prover infrastructure, creating operational dependency
- **Boojum upgrade**: The transition to Boojum (a custom proof system) aimed to reduce hardware requirements but maintained centralized operation

**Starknet's Architecture:**

Starknet uses STARK proofs, which offer transparency (no trusted setup) but with different trade-offs:

- **SHARP (Shared Prover)**: StarkWare operates a centralized prover service (SHARP) that aggregates proofs across multiple StarkEx deployments and Starknet
- **Proof aggregation**: Multiple transaction batches are recursively combined into single proofs, amortizing verification costs but increasing prover complexity
- **Transparent setup**: STARKs require no trusted setup, relying only on hash function security—a meaningful advantage for decentralization
- **Larger proof sizes**: STARK proofs are significantly larger than PLONK proofs, increasing L1 verification costs

**Prover Decentralization Requirements:**

A truly decentralized ZK rollup requires one of the following:

1. **Permissionless prover networks**: Open participation with appropriate incentive mechanisms (proof markets) ensuring liveness and preventing censorship
2. **Proof generation efficiency**: Hardware requirements low enough for commodity operation, enabling diverse prover participation
3. **Threshold proving**: Distributed proof generation across multiple parties, though this remains largely theoretical

Current ZK rollups meet none of these conditions. Proof markets like =nil; Foundation's efforts and Succinct's SP1 represent promising directions but remain immature.

#### 3.2.2 Escape Hatch Implementation

Stage 2 requires users to exit the rollup without operator cooperation. For ZK rollups, this means users must be able to force transaction inclusion and withdrawal processing through L1 mechanisms.

**Starknet's Forced Transaction Mechanism:**

Starknet implements forced transactions through L1 contract calls:

1. Users submit transactions directly to the Starknet L1 contract
2. The sequencer must include these transactions within a bounded timeframe
3. If the sequencer fails to include forced transactions, the system enters a "frozen" state

However, the mechanism's practical utility is limited:
- The forced transaction queue processing depends on the centralized prover
- "Frozen" state recovery procedures remain operator-dependent
- The mechanism has never been activated in production, leaving its reliability unverified

**zkSync Era's Priority Queue:**

zkSync implements a priority queue system for forced inclusion:

1. Users deposit transactions into an L1 priority queue
2. The sequencer must process priority queue transactions in order
3. Failure to process triggers escalating penalties

Similar limitations apply:
- Queue processing depends on centralized prover operation
- Escape hatch functionality for full withdrawal without operator cooperation remains incomplete
- The system's behavior under adversarial conditions is untested in production

### 3.3 Shared Technical Challenges

#### 3.3.1 Smart Contract Upgradeability

Both rollup types face the fundamental tension between upgradeability and trustlessness. Stage 2 requires either:

1. Immutable contracts with no upgrade capability
2. Upgrades governed by on-chain mechanisms with 30+ day delays
3. Adjudication-based upgrades where on-chain governance can accelerate changes through explicit community consent

Current implementations universally employ upgradeable proxy patterns controlled by multisig wallets, enabling rapid response to vulnerabilities but compromising trustlessness.

**Security Council Configurations:**

| Rollup | Council Structure | Upgrade Capability | Time Delay |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Arbitrum | 9-of-12 multisig | Instant for emergencies | 8 days standard |
| Optimism | Guardian + Security Council | Instant override | 7 days standard |
| Base | Coinbase-controlled | Instant | None |
| zkSync | Matter Labs controlled | Instant | None |
| Starknet | StarkWare controlled | Instant | None |

The security rationale for council intervention capability is compelling: novel cryptographic systems and complex state machines inevitably contain bugs. Historical interventions include:

- **Arbitrum (2023)**: Security council addressed a vulnerability in the Nitro upgrade
- **Optimism (2022)**: Rapid patch for the infinite money bug prevented potential \$2B+ exploit
- **zkSync (2024)**: Prover infrastructure issues required manual intervention

However, this capability is precisely what Stage 2 prohibits for non-emergency operations.

#### 3.3.2 Data Availability Considerations

While not strictly a Stage 2 requirement, data availability (DA) choices affect rollup security profiles. The emergence of alternative DA layers (Celestia, EigenDA, Avail) has created "validiums" and "optimiums" that sacrifice Ethereum DA for cost efficiency.

These systems introduce additional trust assumptions:
- **Validiums**: ZK rollups with off-chain DA require trusting DA committee availability
- **Optimiums**: Optimistic rollups with off-chain DA face both DA trust and fraud proof challenges

Under current L2Beat frameworks, systems using alternative DA cannot achieve Stage 2 classification regardless of other decentralization properties, as they introduce trust assumptions beyond Ethereum L1.

## 4. Formal Verification and Audit Barriers

### 4.1 The Verification Gap

Stage 2 readiness implicitly requires that smart contracts be "sufficiently battle-tested"—a criterion that lacks precise definition but encompasses formal verification coverage, audit depth, and production operation without critical vulnerabilities.

#### 4.1.1 Formal Verification Status

Formal verification tools for smart contracts have matured significantly, yet rollup contract verification remains incomplete:

**Available Tools:**
- **Certora Prover**: Automated verification against formal specifications, used by major DeFi protocols
- **Halmos**: Symbolic execution for Solidity, enabling bounded model checking
- **KEVM**: Formal semantics of the EVM enabling mathematical proofs about contract behavior
- **Runtime Verification**: Custom formal methods consulting for complex systems

**Verification Challenges for Rollups:**

1. **Interactive dispute games**: Fraud proof systems involve game-theoretic interactions across multiple contracts and time periods, creating verification complexity that exceeds typical DeFi protocols. Proving properties like "an honest challenger always wins eventually" requires reasoning about adversarial behavior across unbounded time horizons.

2. **Cross-layer interactions**: Rollup contracts interact with L1 in complex ways (deposits, withdrawals, forced transactions), requiring verification of properties that span multiple execution environments.

3. **ZK circuit verification**: Validity proof circuits are written in specialized languages (Circom, Cairo, Noir) with different verification tooling than Solidity. Circuit bugs can be catastrophic—enabling invalid state transitions that appear valid on-chain.

4. **Upgrade mechanism verification**: Proving that upgrade mechanisms preserve security invariants across arbitrary future upgrades is fundamentally difficult.

**Current Verification Coverage:**

| Rollup | Core Contract Audits | Formal Verification | Circuit Verification |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Arbitrum | Multiple (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin) | Partial (Certora for specific invariants) | N/A |
| Optimism | Multiple (Sherlock, Spearbit) | Limited | N/A |
| Base | Inherits OP Stack audits | Limited | N/A |
| zkSync | Multiple (OpenZeppelin, Secure3) | Partial | Limited (internal) |
| Starknet | Multiple (Trail of Bits) | Limited | Partial (Cairo verification) |

No major rollup has achieved comprehensive formal verification of its complete smart contract and proof system stack. This gap directly contributes to the need for security council intervention capability and extended battle-testing periods.

### 4.2 Audit Ecosystem Maturity

#### 4.2.1 Audit Firm Capacity

The specialized nature of rollup security creates audit bottlenecks:

- **Limited expertise**: Few audit firms possess deep expertise in fraud proof systems, ZK circuits, and cross-layer security
- **Extended timelines**: Comprehensive rollup audits require 3-6 months, compared to weeks for typical DeFi protocols
- **Cost barriers**: Full-stack rollup audits cost \$1-5 million, creating economic barriers for smaller teams

**Audit Scope Requirements for Stage 2:**

A comprehensive Stage 2 readiness audit should include:

1. **Core contract review**: Bridge, rollup, and governance contracts
2. **Proof system verification**: Fraud proof or validity proof circuits and verifiers
3. **Escape hatch testing**: Verification that users can exit without operator cooperation
4. **Upgrade mechanism analysis**: Confirmation that upgrade delays and governance meet Stage 2 requirements
5. **Invariant testing**: Automated testing of critical security properties
6. **Fuzzing campaigns**: Extended randomized testing for edge cases

Current industry practice falls short of this comprehensive scope for most rollups.

### 4.3 Historical Bug Analysis

Understanding historical vulnerability patterns informs realistic timeline estimates for Stage 2 readiness.

#### 4.3.1 Bug Taxonomy

Analysis of publicly disclosed rollup vulnerabilities reveals common patterns:

**Bridge Vulnerabilities:**
- Optimism infinite money bug (2022): Incorrect handling of self-destruct in L2 token contract enabled unlimited minting. Discovered through internal review, patched via security council intervention. Severity: Critical.
- Multiple rollup bridge vulnerabilities (2022-2024): Cross-chain message validation errors enabling unauthorized withdrawals. Discovered through audits and bug bounties.

**Proof System Bugs:**
- zkSync proof verification edge cases (2023): Malformed proofs could pass verification under specific conditions. Discovered through internal testing.
- Polygon zkEVM soundness issues (2024): Circuit constraints insufficient for certain transaction types. Discovered through formal analysis.

**Operational Failures:**
- Arbitrum sequencer outages (2023-2024): Multiple multi-hour outages due to software bugs and infrastructure issues. User funds remained safe but transactions halted.
- zkSync withdrawal delays (2024): Prover infrastructure issues caused 24+ hour withdrawal delays.

#### 4.3.2 Discovery Timeline Analysis

Historical data suggests:

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Average discovery time of 6-18 months post-deployment for novel systems
- **Medium severity issues**: Continuous discovery through bug bounties and audits
- **Operational issues**: Ongoing throughout system maturation

This pattern suggests that "battle-testing" for Stage 2 readiness requires minimum 18-24 months of production operation without critical vulnerabilities, following comprehensive audits and formal verification efforts.

## 5. Economic and Incentive Barriers

### 5.1 The Decentralization Paradox

A fundamental tension exists between decentralization and operational efficiency. Stage 2 rollups sacrifice:

- **Upgrade velocity**: 30-day delays for contract changes impede rapid feature development
- **Incident response**: Inability to quickly patch vulnerabilities increases risk exposure
- **Competitive positioning**: Centralized competitors can iterate faster

For venture-backed rollup teams, these trade-offs create perverse incentives. The market has not demonstrated willingness to pay premium fees for decentralization, while operational flexibility provides tangible competitive advantages.

### 5.2 Principal-Agent Problems

The delayed progression toward Stage 2 reflects systematic principal-agent problems between rollup development teams and their stakeholders.

#### 5.2.1 Development Team Incentives

Rollup development teams face competing pressures:

**Investor expectations:**
- Venture capital investors prioritize growth metrics (TVL, transaction volume, user acquisition) over decentralization
- Token launches create liquidity events that may reduce long-term alignment
- Competitive pressure encourages feature development over security hardening

**Regulatory exposure:**
- Maintaining upgrade capability provides legal flexibility for compliance
- Decentralized systems may face different (potentially more favorable) regulatory treatment, but this remains uncertain
- Personal liability concerns for team members favor control retention

**Operational convenience:**
- Centralized control simplifies debugging and incident response
- Rapid iteration enables competitive feature development
- Security council intervention capability provides insurance against catastrophic bugs

#### 5.2.2 Token Holder Misalignment

Governance token holders theoretically represent user interests but face their own misalignments:

**Arbitrum DAO participation:**
- Average governance participation below 10% of circulating supply
- Large token holders (VCs, team) dominate voting outcomes
- Short-term price concerns may override long-term decentralization goals

**Optimism Collective structure:**
- Bicameral governance (Token House + Citizens' House) adds complexity
- Retroactive public goods funding prioritizes ecosystem growth over decentralization
- No clear governance pathway to mandate Stage 2 transition

Token governance has not demonstrated capability to effectively pressure development teams toward decentralization against team preferences.

### 5.3 Coordination Failures

The rollup ecosystem faces a collective action problem regarding Stage 2 progression.

#### 5.3.1 First-Mover Disadvantage

Individual rollups face disincentives to pursue Stage 2 unilaterally:

- **Competitive disadvantage**: Stage 2 constraints (30-day upgrade delays, no emergency intervention) create operational handicaps versus Stage 0/1 competitors
- **Risk concentration**: First Stage 2 rollup bears disproportionate risk of discovering unforeseen issues
- **Limited reward**: Market has not demonstrated willingness to pay premium for decentralization

#### 5.3.2 Coordination Solutions

If all major rollups simultaneously committed to Stage 2 transition, competitive disadvantages would neutralize. Potential coordination mechanisms include:

1. **Industry commitments**: Public pledges with binding timelines and accountability mechanisms
2. **Ethereum protocol incentives**: Preferential treatment for Stage 2 rollups in protocol upgrades or canonical bridge inclusion
3. **Institutional requirements**: Coordinated institutional investor demands for decentralization milestones

No effective coordination mechanism currently exists, perpetuating the collective action problem.

### 5.4 Security Council Political Economy

Security councils represent fascinating governance experiments deserving deeper analysis.

#### 5.4.1 Council Composition and Incentives

**Arbitrum Security Council:**
- 9-of-12 multisig with named members including Offchain Labs representatives, ecosystem participants, and independent security experts
- Members face reputational risk for both action (controversial interventions) and inaction (failure to prevent exploits)
- Compensation structures are not publicly disclosed, creating uncertainty about incentive alignment

**Council member considerations:**
- Legal liability exposure for decisions affecting billions in user assets
- Time commitment for key ceremonies and emergency response
- Reputational stakes in ecosystem success

#### 5.4.2 Sunset Mechanism Challenges

Transitioning away from security council control faces collective action problems:

- Council members may resist obsolescence despite stated commitments
- Gradual power reduction creates ambiguity about intervention thresholds
- No precedent exists for successful council sunset in major protocols

### 5.5 Market Pressure Insufficiency

#### 5.5.1 Revealed Preferences

User behavior reveals limited demand for decentralization:

- **TVL growth in Stage 0 systems**: Base grew from \$0 to \$12B despite no fraud proofs and Coinbase control
- **Fee sensitivity dominance**: Users consistently choose lower-fee options regardless of staging
- **Institutional preferences**: Some institutional users prefer centralized operators for accountability and recourse

#### 5.5.2 Information Asymmetries

Market pressure insufficiency partly reflects information failures:

- Users may not understand staging implications for their assets
- Marketing materials emphasize "Ethereum security" without clarifying trust assumptions
- L2Beat staging information reaches sophisticated users but not mainstream adopters

#### 5.5.3 Network Effects and Lock-in

Even security-conscious users face switching costs:

- Liquidity concentration in specific rollups creates trading advantages
- Application ecosystems develop rollup-specific dependencies
- Bridge risks and costs impede cross-rollup migration

These dynamics insulate Stage 0/1 systems from competitive pressure despite security concerns.

---

## 6. Governance and Organizational Barriers

### 6.1 Foundation-Led Development Models

Major rollups are developed by well-funded foundations or corporations:

- **Arbitrum**: Offchain Labs (raised \$120M+)
- **Optimism**: OP Labs (Optimism Foundation)
- **Base**: Coinbase (publicly traded company)
- **zkSync**: Matter Labs (raised \$450M+)
- **Starknet**: StarkWare (raised \$250M+)

These entities face competing obligations to investors, users, and regulatory authorities. Stage 2 transition requires these organizations to relinquish control—a governance transition with limited precedent in blockchain history.

### 6.2 Token Governance Structural Limitations

#### 6.2.1 Participation Challenges

Low governance participation undermines legitimacy of decentralization claims:

- **Voter apathy**: Most token holders do not participate in governance
- **Delegation concentration**: Delegated voting concentrates power among few delegates
- **Proposal complexity**: Stage 2 transition decisions require technical expertise most voters lack

#### 6.2.2 Governance Attack Surfaces

Active governance creates new attack vectors:

- **Governance attacks**: Malicious proposals could compromise security
- **Vote buying**: Token markets enable governance influence acquisition
- **Timing attacks**: Proposals during low-attention periods may pass without scrutiny

These concerns create legitimate hesitation about transferring security-critical decisions to token governance.

### 6.3 Regulatory Uncertainty

Rollup operators face uncertain regulatory status across multiple dimensions:

#### 6.3.1 Securities Classification

- Governance tokens may constitute securities under Howey test analysis
- "Sufficient decentralization" doctrine suggests decentralized systems may escape securities classification
- Stage 2 achievement could provide regulatory safe harbor, but this remains legally untested

#### 6.3.2 Money Transmission

- Sequencer operation may trigger money transmission licensing requirements
- Centralized control strengthens arguments for regulatory classification
- Decentralization may reduce regulatory exposure but creates compliance challenges

#### 6.3.3 Sanctions Compliance

- OFAC compliance requires ability to filter sanctioned addresses
- Stage 2 immutability potentially conflicts with compliance obligations
- Regulatory guidance on decentralized system compliance remains unclear

These uncertainties create legal risk for development teams pursuing Stage 2, potentially explaining conservative approaches to decentralization.

## 7. Security Implications of Current Staging

### 7.1 Trust Assumption Analysis

Users of Stage 0 and Stage 1 rollups implicitly trust:

**Stage 0 Trust Assumptions:**
1. The sequencer will not censor transactions indefinitely (soft censorship possible)
2. The operator will not submit invalid state roots (or will be caught by monitoring)
3. The security council/operator will not maliciously upgrade contracts
4. The development team will maintain operational infrastructure
5. The prover infrastructure will remain operational (ZK rollups)

**Stage 1 Trust Assumptions:**
1. The security council (6/8+ multisig) will not collude maliciously
2. At least one honest validator exists and is operational for fraud proof submission
3. Emergency upgrades will only occur for legitimate bugs
4. Forced inclusion mechanisms function as designed

**Stage 2 Trust Assumptions:**
1. The proof system is cryptographically sound
2. Smart contracts are bug-free (no security council backup)
3. Ethereum L1 provides security and data availability
4. At least one honest party monitors and challenges invalid assertions (optimistic) or provers remain operational (ZK)

The progression from Stage 0 to Stage 2 represents substantial reduction in trust assumptions, approaching Ethereum L1 security properties.

### 7.2 Attack Surface Comparison

| Attack Vector | Stage 0 | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Ethereum L1 |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Operator malice | High | Medium | None | N/A |
| Security council collusion | High | Medium | None | N/A |
| Sequencer censorship (soft) | High | High | Medium* | Low |
| Sequencer censorship (hard) | High | Low** | None** | Very Low |
| Smart contract bugs | High | Medium | Low*** | Low |
| Cryptographic breaks | Low | Low | Low | Low |
| Data availability failure | Low**** | Low**** | Low**** | Very Low |

*Stage 2 with centralized sequencer has soft censorship risk, mitigated by forced inclusion
**Assuming functional forced inclusion mechanisms
***Lower due to extended battle-testing requirement, but no security council backup
****Assuming Ethereum DA; validiums/optimiums have higher DA risk

### 7.3 Quantifying Security Differences

While precise quantification is difficult, we can estimate relative risk levels:

**Probability of total fund loss (order of magnitude estimates):**
- Stage 0: 0.1-1% annually (operator malice, unpatched bugs, regulatory seizure)
- Stage 1: 0.01-0.1% annually (council collusion, sophisticated attacks)
- Stage 2: 0.001-0.01% annually (undiscovered bugs, cryptographic breaks)
- Ethereum L1: <0.001% annually (protocol-level failures)

These estimates are speculative but illustrate the meaningful security differences between stages.

---

## 8. Comparative Analysis: Protocol-Specific Assessments

### 8.1 Arbitrum One

**Current Status:** Stage 1 (achieved Q4 2024)

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- BOLD fraud proof system deployed with permissionless participation
- 9-of-12 Security Council with instant upgrade capability for emergencies
- 8-day standard upgrade delay (Stage 2 requires 30 days)
- Centralized sequencer with Timeboost mechanism planned

**Stage 2 Blockers:**
1. Security council retains emergency upgrade capability without adjudication
2. Upgrade delay insufficient (8 days vs. 30 days required)
3. Sequencer remains centralized (though not strictly required for Stage 2)
4. Insufficient formal verification coverage of BOLD contracts

**Formal Verification Status:**
- Multiple audits completed (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin)
- Partial Certora verification of specific invariants
- BOLD dispute game lacks comprehensive formal verification

**Governance Pathway:**
Arbitrum DAO theoretically controls upgrade parameters, but proposals to extend delays and limit council powers have faced resistance from both the foundation and large token holders concerned about operational flexibility.

**Projected Timeline:** Q4 2025 - Q2 2026

*Contingent on: 18+ months BOLD operation without critical vulnerabilities, governance approval of extended delays, council sunset mechanism implementation*

### 8.2 Optimism

**Current Status:** Stage 1 (achieved Q1 2025)

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- Fault proof system (Cannon) deployed on mainnet
- Guardian role with Security Council override capability
- 7-day standard upgrade delay
- Permissioned fault proof proposers

**Stage 2 Blockers:**
1. Fault proof system recently deployed, requires extended battle-testing
2. Security council override capability without sufficient constraints
3. Permissioned proposal submission (not permissionless)
4. Superchain coordination complexity

**Formal Verification Status:**
- Multiple audits (Sherlock contest, Spearbit)
- Limited formal verification of fault proof contracts
- MIPS VM implementation lacks comprehensive verification

**Superchain Considerations:**
Optimism's vision of multiple L2s sharing the OP Stack creates coordination complexity. Stage 2 for Optimism mainnet may need to precede or coordinate with Superchain-wide standards, as shared infrastructure creates interdependencies.

**Projected Timeline:** Q2 2026 - Q4 2026

*Contingent on: 18+ months fault proof operation, permissionless proposer transition, governance mechanism maturation*

### 8.3 Base

**Current Status:** Stage 0

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- OP Stack fault proofs deployed (inheriting Optimism's system)
- Security Council retains full override capability
- Coinbase-controlled sequencer and upgrade authority
- No independent security council

**Stage 2 Blockers:**
1. Security Council override without constraints
2. Coinbase corporate control over critical infrastructure
3. No independent governance mechanism
4. Regulatory uncertainty for publicly traded company

**Unique Considerations:**
As a subsidiary of a publicly traded company, Base faces constraints that pure-crypto entities do not:
- SEC reporting and compliance obligations
- Fiduciary duties to Coinbase shareholders
- Regulatory relationships that may require maintaining control

**Projected Timeline:** 2027+ (highly uncertain)

*Contingent on: Regulatory clarity, Coinbase strategic decisions, potential spin-off or governance transition*

### 8.4 zkSync Era

**Current Status:** Stage 0

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- PLONK-based validity proofs with Boojum prover
- Centralized prover operated by Matter Labs
- KZG trusted setup dependency (participated in Ethereum ceremony)
- Priority queue for forced transactions (limited functionality)

**Stage 2 Blockers:**
1. Centralized prover infrastructure with no decentralization pathway
2. Escape hatch depends on prover operation
3. Upgradeable contracts without sufficient delay
4. ZK circuit verification incomplete

**Cryptographic Considerations:**
zkSync's PLONK system requires trusted setup, introducing cryptographic assumptions beyond hash function security. While the Ethereum KZG ceremony provides strong security, this represents an additional trust assumption compared to transparent proof systems.

**Prover Decentralization Challenges:**
Matter Labs has explored proof markets and distributed proving but faces fundamental challenges:
- Hardware requirements remain substantial (GPU clusters)
- Proof generation latency affects user experience
- Incentive design for reliable prover markets is unsolved

**Projected Timeline:** 2026 - 2027

*Contingent on: Prover decentralization breakthrough, comprehensive circuit verification, extended operation without vulnerabilities*

### 8.5 Starknet

**Current Status:** Stage 0

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- STARK validity proofs (transparent, no trusted setup)
- SHARP centralized prover aggregating multiple deployments
- Cairo-based execution environment
- Forced transaction mechanism through L1

**Stage 2 Blockers:**
1. Centralized SHARP prover with no decentralization timeline
2. Operator-controlled forced transaction processing
3. No functional escape hatch independent of operator
4. Cairo ecosystem maturity limits tooling and verification

**Cryptographic Advantages:**
STARKs offer transparency (no trusted setup) and quantum resistance, providing stronger long-term security assumptions than SNARK-based systems. However, larger proof sizes increase verification costs.

**Ecosystem Considerations:**
Starknet's unique architecture (Cairo language, STARK proofs) creates both advantages and barriers:
- Smaller developer ecosystem than EVM-compatible rollups
- Limited formal verification tooling for Cairo
- Proof aggregation through SHARP creates operational dependencies

**Projected Timeline:** 2027+

*Contingent on: SHARP decentralization, Cairo verification tooling maturation, escape hatch implementation*

---

## 9. Pathways Toward Stage 2

### 9.1 Technical Solutions

#### 9.1.1 Proof System Maturation

For optimistic rollups, the path forward requires:

1. **Extended production operation**: Minimum 18-24 months of fraud proof system operation without critical vulnerabilities or security council intervention
2. **Permissionless validator sets**: Transition from whitelisted to open challenger participation with appropriate economic incentives
3. **Formal verification**: Comprehensive verification of dispute resolution contracts using tools like Certora, with published specifications and proofs

For ZK rollups:

1. **Prover decentralization**: Development of proof markets (=nil; Foundation, Succinct) or threshold proving schemes enabling permissionless participation
2. **Hardware efficiency**: Continued improvements in proof generation efficiency, potentially enabling CPU-based proving for simpler transactions
3. **Circuit verification**: Formal verification of ZK circuits, an emerging field requiring specialized tooling development
4. **Escape hatch activation**: Production testing of forced transaction and withdrawal mechanisms under adversarial conditions

#### 9.1.2 Sequencer Decentralization

While not strictly required for Stage 2, sequencer decentralization addresses important user experience and censorship resistance concerns:

**Shared sequencing adoption:**
- Espresso, Astria, and similar projects offer decentralized sequencing infrastructure
- Trade-offs include latency increases (consensus overhead) and cross-rollup MEV implications
- Adoption requires rollup teams to cede sequencer revenue and control

**Based sequencing implementation:**
- Ethereum L1 proposers order L2 transactions
- Inherits L1 decentralization but sacrifices pre-confirmation speed
- Requires protocol-level support and rollup architectural changes

**Hybrid approaches:**
- Centralized sequencing with robust forced inclusion guarantees
- Time-bounded sequencer exclusivity with fallback to decentralized ordering
- MEV-share mechanisms distributing sequencer revenue to users

### 9.2 Governance Mechanism Designs

#### 9.2.1 Binding Decentralization Commitments

Rollup teams could implement smart contract mechanisms that automatically progress toward Stage 2:

1. **Time-locked parameter transitions**: Contracts automatically extend upgrade delays on predetermined schedules (e.g., 7 days → 14 days → 30 days over 24 months)

2. **TVL-triggered decentralization**: Security council powers automatically reduce as TVL crosses thresholds, recognizing that larger systems require stronger guarantees

3. **Governance-gated progression**: Token holder votes explicitly unlock Stage 2 features, creating accountability for decentralization decisions

4. **Bonding requirements**: Development teams post bonds forfeited if decentralization milestones are missed, aligning incentives with stated commitments

#### 9.2.2 Security Council Sunset Mechanisms

Designing councils with built-in obsolescence:

1. **Diminishing intervention scope**: Council powers narrow over time (full upgrade → emergency only → veto only → none)

2. **Increasing multisig thresholds**: Progressive increases (6/8 → 8/10 → 10/12 → 12/15) make coordination increasingly difficult

3. **Adjudication transitions**: Council can only accelerate governance-approved upgrades, not initiate independent changes

4. **Sunset dates**: Hard deadlines for council dissolution, with fallback to pure on-chain governance

### 9.3 Market and Regulatory Catalysts

#### 9.3.1 Institutional Demand Development

Institutional adoption may eventually require Stage 2:

- **Custody requirements**: Regulated custodians may mandate trustless exit capability for client assets
- **Insurance underwriting**: Lower premiums for Stage 2 systems reflecting reduced counterparty risk
- **Audit standards**: SOC 2 and similar frameworks may incorporate staging into compliance requirements
- **Fiduciary obligations**: Investment managers may face liability for holding assets in Stage 0 systems

#### 9.3.2 Regulatory Framework Development

Clear regulatory frameworks could accelerate decentralization:

- **Safe harbor provisions**: SEC or CFTC guidance providing regulatory protection for sufficiently decentralized systems
- **Liability limitations**: Reduced legal exposure for Stage 2 operators who cannot intervene in system operation
- **Compliance pathways**: Defined mechanisms for permissionless systems to meet AML/KYC requirements through application-layer solutions

#### 9.3.3 Ethereum Protocol Integration

Ethereum core protocol could incentivize Stage 2:

- **Canonical bridge preferences**: Protocol-endorsed bridges could require Stage 2 for inclusion
- **Blob fee discounts**: Reduced data availability costs for Stage 2 rollups
- **Enshrined rollup consideration**: Protocol-level rollup implementations guaranteeing Stage 2 properties

### 9.4 Competitive Dynamics

#### 9.4.1 First-Mover Advantages

The first major rollup to achieve Stage 2 may capture significant benefits:

- **Security-conscious user migration**: Institutions and high-value users may preferentially choose Stage 2
- **Marketing differentiation**: "Fully decentralized" messaging provides competitive positioning
- **Regulatory advantages**: Potential safe harbor benefits for decentralized classification

#### 9.4.2 Industry Coordination Mechanisms

Breaking the collective action problem requires coordination:

1. **Public commitment ceremonies**: Major rollups simultaneously announce binding Stage 2 timelines
2. **Ethereum Foundation facilitation**: Neutral party coordination of industry-wide standards
3. **Investor pressure**: Coordinated VC demands for decentralization milestones as funding conditions

---

## 10. Discussion and Implications

### 10.1 The Decentralization Theater Problem

Current rollup marketing often emphasizes decentralization aspirations while operational reality remains centralized. This "decentralization theater" creates information asymmetry:

- Users assume Ethereum-equivalent security based on "Layer 2" branding
- Actual trust assumptions are substantially weaker than implied
- Marketing materials obscure staging limitations and security council powers

The L2Beat staging system has improved transparency, but user awareness remains limited. Addressing this gap requires:

1. **Standardized disclosures**: Mandatory staging information in user interfaces
2. **Educational initiatives**: User-facing explanations of trust assumption differences
3. **Wallet integration**: Staging warnings when interacting with Stage 0 systems

### 10.2 The Security-Flexibility Spectrum

Our analysis reveals a fundamental spectrum:

\`\`\`
Full Centralization ←————————————————→ Full Decentralization
     (Maximum flexibility,                (Maximum security,
      minimum security)                    minimum flexibility)
\`\`\`

Stage 0 and Stage 1 represent intermediate positions that may be appropriate for certain use cases:

- **Stage 0 appropriate**: Gaming, social applications, micro-transactions where operational flexibility outweighs security concerns
- **Stage 1 appropriate**: General-purpose applications, moderate-value transactions with meaningful but not absolute security requirements  
- **Stage 2 required**: High-value DeFi, institutional custody, long-term holdings demanding trustless guarantees

The industry may evolve toward a tiered ecosystem where staging matches use case requirements, rather than universal Stage 2 adoption.

### 10.3 Implications for Ethereum's Roadmap

Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap assumed L2s would inherit L1 security properties. The protracted Stage 2 timeline challenges this assumption:

1. **Security fragmentation**: Different rollups offer different security levels, complicating the "Ethereum security" narrative
2. **User confusion**: Navigating staging complexity requires expertise most users lack
3. **Systemic risk**: Concentrated TVL in Stage 0/1 systems creates ecosystem-wide vulnerability to coordinated attacks or regulatory action

Ethereum core developers may need to consider:

- **Enshrined rollups**: Protocol-level rollup implementations with guaranteed Stage 2 properties
- **Staging requirements**: Minimum staging for inclusion in official ecosystem resources or canonical bridges
- **Economic incentives**: Protocol-level rewards (reduced fees, priority inclusion) for Stage 2 achievement

### 10.4 Broader Blockchain Industry Implications

The challenges facing Ethereum rollups have implications for other ecosystems:

- **Alternative L1s**: Competing chains may emphasize native scalability over L2 complexity, marketing simplicity against Ethereum's fragmented security landscape
- **Modular blockchain thesis**: DA layers and execution environments face similar decentralization challenges; the "modular stack" may perpetuate centralization at each layer
- **Cross-chain security**: Bridge security depends on the weakest link in connected chains; Stage 0 rollups create vulnerabilities for the broader multi-chain ecosystem

---

## 11. Conclusions and Future Outlook

### 11.1 Summary of Findings

This research has identified multiple interconnected factors explaining the delayed progression toward Rollup Stage 2:

1. **Technical complexity**: Fraud proofs, validity proofs, and escape hatches require years of development and battle-testing, with BOLD and Cannon representing significant but incomplete progress

2. **Formal verification gaps**: Insufficient verification coverage of critical smart contracts and ZK circuits creates legitimate need for security council intervention capability

3. **Economic misalignment**: Principal-agent problems between development teams, investors, and users create incentives favoring operational flexibility over decentralization

4. **Coordination failures**: Collective action problems prevent individual rollups from bearing first-mover costs of Stage 2 transition

5. **Governance limitations**: Token governance has not demonstrated capability to effectively pressure teams toward decentralization

6. **Regulatory uncertainty**: Compliance obligations may conflict with Stage 2 requirements, creating legal risk for development teams

7. **Market pressure insufficiency**: Information asymmetries, network effects, and switching costs insulate Stage 0/1 systems from competitive pressure

### 11.2 Projected Timeline

Based on our analysis of technical readiness, formal verification requirements, and historical bug discovery patterns, we project:

- **Q4 2025 - Q1 2026**: First major rollup (likely Arbitrum) achieves Stage 2, contingent on 18+ months BOLD operation without critical vulnerabilities
- **2026**: 2-3 additional rollups reach Stage 2 (Optimism, potentially zkSync)
- **2027-2028**: Stage 2 becomes standard expectation for serious rollups handling significant value
- **2028+**: Stage 0/1 systems relegated to low-value applications or face significant TVL migration

These projections assume:
- No major security incidents resetting development timelines
- Continued ecosystem growth maintaining development funding
- Gradual regulatory clarity enabling decentralization
- Formal verification tooling maturation for rollup-specific challenges

### 11.3 Recommendations

**For Rollup Development Teams:**
1. Publish binding decentralization roadmaps with specific milestones and accountability mechanisms
2. Implement progressive decentralization in smart contracts (automatic delay extensions, council power reductions)
3. Invest in comprehensive formal verification, publishing specifications and proofs
4. Prioritize security council sunset planning with clear timelines
5. Coordinate with other rollups on industry-wide Stage 2 transition

**For Users and Institutions:**
1. Incorporate staging into risk assessment frameworks, adjusting exposure based on security requirements
2. Demand transparency regarding trust assumptions before depositing significant value
3. Consider staging when allocating capital across rollups, potentially paying premium fees for Stage 2 security
4. Engage in governance to pressure teams toward decentralization commitments

**For Ethereum Governance:**
1. Consider staging requirements for canonical bridge inclusion or official ecosystem endorsement
2. Explore protocol-level incentives (fee discounts, priority access) for Stage 2 rollups
3. Support research into enshrined rollup designs providing guaranteed Stage 2 properties
4. Facilitate industry coordination on decentralization timelines

**For Regulators:**
1. Develop frameworks accommodating decentralized systems, recognizing reduced counterparty risk
2. Consider safe harbor provisions for Stage 2 systems meeting defined decentralization criteria
3. Engage with technical experts to understand staging implications for investor protection
4. Provide clarity on compliance pathways for permissionless systems

**For Auditors and Security Researchers:**
1. Develop specialized expertise in rollup-specific security (fraud proofs, ZK circuits, cross-layer interactions)
2. Create standardized audit frameworks for Stage 2 readiness assessment
3. Invest in formal verification tooling for rollup contract verification
4. Publish research on bug discovery patterns to inform battle-testing requirements

### 11.4 Limitations and Future Research

This research has several limitations:

1. Rapidly evolving landscape may obsolete specific protocol assessments within months
2. Limited access to internal development roadmaps and formal verification progress
3. Regulatory developments remain highly uncertain and jurisdiction-dependent
4. Timeline projections depend on assumptions about bug discovery patterns that may not hold

Future research directions include:

1. **Quantitative incentive modeling**: Formal game-theoretic analysis of decentralization incentives and coordination mechanisms
2. **Formal verification progress tracking**: Systematic monitoring of verification coverage across major rollups
3. **User perception studies**: Empirical research on user understanding of staging and security implications
4. **Bug discovery analysis**: Statistical modeling of vulnerability discovery patterns to inform battle-testing requirements
5. **Comparative ecosystem analysis**: Examination of decentralization challenges in non-Ethereum L2 ecosystems

### 11.5 Concluding Remarks

The slow progression toward Rollup Stage 2 represents one of the most significant challenges facing the Ethereum ecosystem. While rollups have delivered meaningful scaling improvements—processing millions of transactions daily at fraction of mainnet costs—their current trust assumptions fundamentally compromise the trustlessness that distinguishes blockchain systems from traditional infrastructure.

The path forward requires coordinated effort across technical, economic, governance, and regulatory domains. Technical solutions (proof system maturation, formal verification, prover decentralization) must combine with governance innovations (binding commitments, council sunsets) and market catalysts (institutional demand, regulatory clarity) to overcome the collective action problems perpetuating centralization.

The first Stage 2 rollups will represent a watershed moment—demonstrating that scalability and decentralization can coexist, and that the blockchain industry can deliver on its foundational promises. Until then, users must recognize that current L2s, despite their Ethereum association and "Layer 2" branding, offer security properties substantially weaker than the underlying chain.

The blockchain industry's credibility rests on delivering the decentralization it promises. Rollup Stage 2 is not merely a technical milestone but a test of whether the ecosystem can prioritize its foundational principles over operational convenience and short-term competitive advantage. The coming years will determine whether Ethereum's rollup-centric future fulfills its potential or remains perpetually compromised by centralized training wheels.
