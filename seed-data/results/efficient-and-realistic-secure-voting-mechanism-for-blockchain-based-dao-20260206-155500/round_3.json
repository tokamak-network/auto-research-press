The work demonstrates strong understanding of blockchain-specific attack vectors and includes practical deployment considerations, though it lacks novel contributions to the field and could benefit from deeper analysis of cross-chain governance and formal verification approaches.",

        "Excellent gas cost analysis with concrete benchmarks across multiple L2 networks and detailed breakdown of individual operations (SLOAD, SSTORE costs with EIP-2929 considerations)",
        "Strong coverage of smart contract-specific attack vectors including checkpoint array griefing, reentrancy in delegation, and timelock bypass - these are often overlooked in academic treatments",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-chain governance (Layer 5 in the architecture diagram) is mentioned but not substantively analyzed - no discussion of bridge security assumptions, message verification costs, or cross-chain vote aggregation challenges",
        "Missing analysis of ERC-4337 account abstraction implications for voting mechanisms, which fundamentally changes gas payment models and enables new delegation patterns",
        "No discussion of formal verification tools (Certora, Slither, Echidna) or their application to governance contracts, despite mentioning formal verification in the executive summary as a future direction"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated section on cross-chain voting that analyzes specific bridge implementations (LayerZero, Axelar, Wormhole), their trust assumptions, and gas costs for cross-chain message passing in governance contexts",
        "Include analysis of storage optimization patterns (e.g., using bitmaps for vote tracking, packed structs for checkpoints) that could reduce the gas costs cited - the current analysis presents costs as fixed rather than optimizable",
        "Provide concrete smart contract vulnerability case studies from actual DAO exploits (Beanstalk governance attack, Build Finance hostile takeover) to ground the theoretical attack vectors in real-world incidents"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain systems perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge but stops short of the depth required for novel contribution. The gas analysis is commendable - citing specific costs for cold vs warm storage access and including EIP-2929 considerations shows current technical awareness. However, the checkpoint implementation shown uses a standard binary search that could be optimized; there's no discussion of the gas implications of different checkpoint pruning strategies or the tradeoffs between checkpoint granularity and lookup costs.\n\nThe smart contract code examples are production-aware but incomplete. The castVote function correctly uses getPriorVotes for snapshot-based voting, but there's no discussion of the block.number vs block.timestamp debate for snapshots, which has significant implications for L2 deployments where block times differ substantially from mainnet. The checkpoint griefing attack analysis is valuable, but the proposed mitigations (FIFO replacement, interval-based pruning) aren't analyzed for their own security implications - FIFO replacement could enable vote manipulation by forcing out relevant checkpoints.\n\nThe manuscript's treatment of L2 deployments is superficial. While cost comparisons are provided, there's no analysis of the different security models (optimistic vs ZK rollups), finality times and their impact on governance timelocks, or the implications of sequencer centralization for vote ordering. For Arbitrum and Optimism specifically, the sequencer could theoretically front-run or censor governance transactions - this attack vector isn't addressed.\n\nMost critically for a 2024 publication, there's no discussion of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) in governance contexts. Vote transactions can be sandwiched, governance proposals can be front-run, and the interaction between MEV and vote-buying creates complex dynamics that deserve analysis. The Flashbots ecosystem and private mempools have implications for governance privacy that aren't explored.\n\nThe scalability analysis would benefit from concrete numbers on voter population limits. At what point does a single-block vote tally become infeasible? What are the gas limits for proposal execution with complex on-chain actions? These practical constraints shape real DAO architecture decisions but aren't quantified here.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a mechanism design perspective, this manuscript makes valuable contributions to understanding the formal properties of DAO voting systems, particularly in its treatment of the Sybil-plutocracy tradeoff and vote-buying dynamics. The proof that quadratic voting degenerates to linear voting without identity costs is well-constructed, and the derived condition for graduated verification to preserve QV benefits (w(l)/w(l') \u2264 \u221a(c(l)/c(l'))) is a useful design criterion. However, several gaps limit the work's completeness as a governance mechanism analysis.\n\nThe treatment of delegation is notably thin given its centrality to real-world DAO governance. The manuscript correctly identifies that delegation concentrates power but doesn't analyze the mechanism design implications: What are the equilibrium properties of delegation markets? Under what conditions do liquid democracy systems converge to representative democracy? How do delegation fees or rewards affect the delegate selection equilibrium? The Votium example actually illustrates a delegation market (bribing veCRV holders who have delegated gauge voting rights), but this connection isn't developed.\n\nThe participation incentive analysis is similarly underdeveloped. The manuscript acknowledges low participation rates but doesn't formally model why rational voters abstain or how mechanism design can address this. The literature on rational ignorance (Downs, 1957) and its application to blockchain governance (e.g., Buterin's writing on voter apathy) should inform a formal treatment of when participation incentives improve welfare versus when they introduce noise from uninformed voting.\n\nOn Sybil resistance, while the individual-level analysis is strong, the manuscript underestimates the threat from coordinated groups. BrightID's social graph analysis, for instance, fails when attackers can create genuine-looking social connections among Sybil identities - a documented attack vector in Gitcoin grants. The formal analysis should distinguish between (1) individual Sybil creation costs, (2) marginal costs for organized groups with existing infrastructure, and (3) costs for nation-state adversaries. The graduated verification framework is promising but needs adversarial analysis against these different threat levels.\n\nFinally, the conviction voting analysis correctly identifies strategic stake timing but doesn't fully explore the mechanism's game-theoretic properties. Specifically: What is the equilibrium participation level? Does conviction voting create incentives for 'always-on' governance participation that may exclude part-time participants? How does the decay parameter \u03b1 affect the tradeoff between responsiveness and manipulation resistance? These questions have direct implications for mechanism parameter selection.",

        "Analyze the gap between the formal definitions provided and what deployed systems actually achieve - for instance, explicitly prove that commit-reveal schemes fail receipt-freeness by constructing the distinguishing adversary, and quantify the privacy loss in threshold decryption schemes as a function of the corruption threshold"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of cryptographic voting protocols, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive treatment. The simulation-based definition of ballot secrecy is correctly formulated, and the acknowledgment that standard blockchain voting provides 'none of these properties' is refreshingly honest. However, several critical gaps remain.\n\nFirst, the formal definitions need tightening. The receipt-freeness definition provided is non-standard - the canonical definition involves the voter's ability to 'fake' a vote to a coercer, not merely produce convincing receipts. The JCJ coercion-resistance definition requires an untappable channel during registration, which is fundamentally incompatible with transparent blockchain registration unless you introduce additional trusted infrastructure (which should be explicitly modeled).\n\nSecond, the manuscript promises analysis of 'zero-knowledge proof constructions for vote validity and tallying' but delivers only high-level descriptions. For MACI specifically, critical questions remain unaddressed: What is the circuit size and proving time? How does the coordinator's private key management affect the trust model? What happens if the coordinator goes offline - is there a recovery mechanism? The claim that MACI provides ballot secrecy should be qualified: it provides secrecy against external observers but the coordinator learns all votes.\n\nThird, the treatment of threshold cryptography is superficial. The manuscript mentions 't-of-n parties must collude' but doesn't specify whether this is computational or information-theoretic security, doesn't discuss the DKG (distributed key generation) requirements, and doesn't analyze the liveness-safety tradeoffs in threshold settings.\n\nThe informal theorem about transparency-privacy incompatibility is valuable but should be stated more precisely. Specifically, the issue is that blockchain transactions are authenticated (signed by the voter's key), creating an inherent link between identity and vote. Time-lock puzzles don't solve this - they only delay revelation. TEEs shift trust to hardware manufacturers. The only cryptographic solution that could work in principle is a proper anonymous credential system with unlinkable showing, but this requires trusted issuance.\n\nFinally, the manuscript should engage more deeply with the end-to-end verifiability literature. The cast-as-intended, recorded-as-cast, tallied-as-recorded decomposition is correct, but the manuscript doesn't analyze how these properties interact with privacy requirements or discuss the Benaloh challenge for cast-as-intended verification in encrypted voting systems.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of DAO voting mechanisms that demonstrates solid technical foundations across blockchain systems, mechanism design, and cryptographic protocols. All three reviewers consistently praise the formal treatment of security properties, the hierarchical presentation of privacy definitions, and the practical grounding in real-world systems (gas cost analysis, Votium bribe data, concrete attack vectors). The work fills an important gap between industry reports and academic treatments of decentralized governance.\n\nHowever, significant gaps remain that prevent acceptance in the current form. Most critically, the cryptographic protocol analysis is incomplete: MACI's ZK-SNARK construction is referenced but not analyzed in detail, verifiable mixnets and homomorphic tallying are mentioned but absent from the main text, and formal security proofs are lacking. The delegation analysis promised in the executive summary ('over 80% of voting power flows through delegates') is not substantively developed despite being central to practical DAO governance. Cross-chain governance receives only superficial treatment. These are not minor omissions\u2014they represent core components that the manuscript claims to cover but does not deliver.\n\nThe average score of 6.9 and the consistency of concerns across reviewers (all noting incomplete coverage of promised content, lack of formal proofs, and underdeveloped sections) indicate that while the foundation is strong, substantial work remains. The novelty scores (5-6 across reviewers) also suggest the manuscript needs to either deepen its analytical contributions or more clearly position itself as a survey with comprehensive coverage\u2014currently it falls between these goals.",

    "recommendation": "The manuscript has a strong foundation but oversells its coverage in the executive summary relative to what the main text delivers. Authors should either (1) significantly expand the cryptographic protocol analysis, delegation dynamics, and cross-chain governance sections to match the promised scope, or (2) narrow the claimed contributions to match the current depth of analysis. The former path leads to a comprehensive reference work; the latter to a more focused but still valuable contribution. Given the solid technical foundations already present, I recommend the expansion path with particular attention to the cryptographic formalism that Reviewer 3 correctly identifies as incomplete. Include concrete case studies (Beanstalk, Build Finance) to ground theoretical attack vectors, and ensure all mechanisms mentioned in the introduction receive substantive treatment in the body.",
