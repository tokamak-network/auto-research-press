However, the document appears incomplete (cuts off mid-section 4.2.1), lacks critical analysis of cross-chain governance challenges, and insufficiently addresses practical smart contract security vulnerabilities and audit considerations that are essential for production deployments.",

        "Document is incomplete - Section 4.2.1 on MACI cuts off abruptly, missing critical analysis of ZK circuit security assumptions, trusted setup concerns, and the coordinator trust model's implications for decentralization",
        "No discussion of cross-chain governance challenges including bridge security, message passing latency, state synchronization across L2s, and the attack surface introduced by multi-chain voting aggregation",
        "Insufficient coverage of smart contract security vulnerabilities specific to governance: no mention of governance-specific attack patterns like proposal spam attacks, timelock bypass vulnerabilities, delegate manipulation, or the recent Tornado Cash governance attack pattern"

        "Complete Section 4 and add dedicated analysis of cross-chain voting architectures including LayerZero/Wormhole-based governance, Snapshot X's cross-chain execution, and the security tradeoffs of off-chain voting with on-chain execution",
        "Add a section on smart contract audit considerations for governance systems, including common vulnerability patterns (reentrancy in vote delegation, integer overflow in voting power calculations, access control in proposal execution), formal verification approaches, and references to actual governance exploits",
        "Include concrete gas optimization strategies beyond EIP-2930 access lists: merkle-based vote aggregation, batch voting transactions, storage packing for vote receipts, and comparison of L2 deployment costs (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) versus mainnet"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain systems engineering perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of on-chain voting mechanics but has significant gaps for practical implementation guidance. The gas analysis is commendable\u2014the breakdown showing SLOAD costs under EIP-2929 and checkpoint binary search overhead reflects real engineering knowledge. However, the treatment of scalability is incomplete. For large voter populations (>10,000), the manuscript should analyze merkle tree-based vote aggregation patterns where individual votes are submitted to an off-chain aggregator and only the merkle root is posted on-chain, reducing per-voter gas costs from ~55k to amortized ~2-5k gas. The Snapshot + SafeSnap pattern deserves detailed analysis as it's the dominant architecture for gas-efficient governance.\n\nThe smart contract code examples are syntactically correct but lack security annotations. The castVote function shown doesn't include reentrancy guards, and while Governor Bravo is generally safe due to state ordering, the manuscript should discuss why and when such guards are necessary. The checkpoint mechanism correctly prevents flash loans but the manuscript doesn't analyze the griefing vector where an attacker can inflate checkpoint array length through frequent small transfers, increasing getPriorVotes gas costs for targeted addresses.\n\nMost critically, the absence of cross-chain governance analysis is a major gap given that most significant DAOs now operate across multiple chains. Uniswap's cross-chain governance through Wormhole, Aave's cross-chain governance module, and the emerging pattern of L1 voting with L2 execution all present unique security challenges including bridge trust assumptions, message replay attacks, and governance timing attacks exploiting cross-chain latency. The manuscript should also address the on-chain vs off-chain computation tradeoff more explicitly\u2014Snapshot's off-chain voting with IPFS storage achieves zero gas cost for voters but introduces availability and censorship concerns that deserve formal analysis.",

      "suggestions": [
        "Complete Section 4.2 and add analysis of alternative cryptographic approaches: threshold decryption (e.g., using Shamir secret sharing with DKG), homomorphic tallying (Paillier, ElGamal), and verifiable mixnets - compare their trust assumptions and efficiency tradeoffs",
        "Strengthen the formal security analysis by providing simulation-based definitions and clearly stating the trust assumptions for each property (e.g., MACI achieves ballot secrecy against all parties except the coordinator, but not receipt-freeness against a coordinator-voter coalition)",
        "Address the open problem of achieving receipt-freeness on transparent ledgers more thoroughly - discuss time-lock puzzles, trusted execution environments (TEEs), and their limitations; the JCJ coercion-resistance scheme and why it doesn't directly apply to blockchain settings"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic voting protocols perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational understanding but falls short of the rigor expected for publication in this specialized area. The formal definitions in Section 2.2 are largely correct but would benefit from more precise specification - for instance, the ballot secrecy definition should explicitly state assumptions about the tallying authority and whether we're in the computational or information-theoretic setting. The claim that 'no deployed system achieves true coercion-resistance' is accurate but deserves deeper analysis: what are the fundamental barriers? The paper correctly notes the transparency-privacy tension but doesn't adequately explore cryptographic mitigations like commit-reveal schemes with time-locked encryption, or the use of trusted hardware (SGX/TDX) as a pragmatic middle ground.\n\nThe MACI analysis is the strongest cryptographic content but is unfortunately incomplete. The key rotation mechanism provides only weak bribery resistance - a coercer present during the entire voting period can demand the voter not rotate keys, and the voter cannot prove they didn't submit a later rotation. This limitation should be explicitly stated. Additionally, the coordinator in MACI is a single point of failure for privacy; threshold variants exist but aren't discussed.\n\nMost critically, the paper omits several important cryptographic constructions: (1) homomorphic tallying where votes are encrypted and tallied without decryption of individual ballots, (2) verifiable mixnets for anonymizing vote-voter linkages, (3) blind signatures for credential-based voting. The zero-knowledge proof discussion focuses only on MACI's specific construction without broader context of how ZKPs enable verifiable computation in voting (e.g., proving vote validity without revealing the vote). For a paper titled around 'secure voting mechanisms,' the cryptographic coverage is surprisingly narrow. I recommend the authors consult the Handbook of Voting (2022) and recent works on blockchain-based e-voting (e.g., McCorry et al.'s 'A Smart Contract for Boardroom Voting') to strengthen this section substantially.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a decentralized governance and mechanism design perspective, this manuscript demonstrates strong technical foundations but has notable gaps in coverage of practical governance challenges. The formal treatment of vote-buying equilibria is particularly well-done, correctly identifying that transparent voting fundamentally enables credible bribery commitments. However, the analysis would benefit from deeper engagement with mitigation strategies beyond cryptographic privacy\u2014for instance, the literature on commitment devices, vote locking periods, or retroactive voting power adjustments that could increase bribery costs even with transparent votes.\n\nThe Sybil resistance analysis correctly identifies the fundamental tension but presents an overly binary view. Real-world systems like Gitcoin Passport demonstrate that graduated identity verification can provide meaningful Sybil resistance while preserving pseudonymity for most participants. A more nuanced analysis would characterize the Pareto frontier between identity costs, Sybil resistance, and accessibility.\n\nMost critically, the manuscript's treatment of delegation is essentially absent despite delegation being the dominant mode of participation in major DAOs. Empirical data shows that >80% of voting power in protocols like Compound and Uniswap comes through delegation. This creates second-order game-theoretic considerations: delegate selection becomes a meta-game, delegates face different incentive structures than direct voters, and delegation markets (explicit or implicit) can emerge. The bribery analysis should extend to delegate bribery, which may have different equilibrium properties due to delegates' reputational concerns and repeated-game dynamics.\n\nThe conviction voting analysis is solid but should address the tension between time-weighted voting and responsive governance. The mechanism inherently disadvantages proposals responding to urgent situations (security vulnerabilities, market conditions), creating a potential governance attack vector where time-sensitive malicious proposals exploit the slow response of legitimate opposition.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from explicit discussion of how these mechanisms compose\u2014most production DAOs use hybrid systems (e.g., token-weighted voting with delegation, quorum requirements, and timelocks), and the interaction effects between mechanism components deserve formal analysis.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a technically solid survey of DAO voting mechanisms with notable strengths in formal security modeling, gas cost analysis, and game-theoretic treatment of vote-buying dynamics. All three reviewers commend the rigorous hierarchy of privacy properties (ballot secrecy \u2192 receipt-freeness \u2192 coercion-resistance), the quantitative analysis of plutocratic concentration using real on-chain data, and the practical smart contract considerations including specific Ethereum gas benchmarks. The fundamental theorem on transparency-privacy tension is recognized as an important contribution that addresses a commonly overlooked issue in DAO governance literature.\n\nHowever, a critical structural problem undermines the manuscript's current form: Section 4.2.1 on MACI is truncated mid-sentence, leaving the cryptographic protocol analysis incomplete. This is not a minor presentation issue\u2014it represents a significant gap in a paper claiming comprehensive coverage of cryptographic voting protocols. Beyond this incompleteness, reviewers consistently identify substantive gaps: the absence of cross-chain governance challenges (Reviewer 1), narrow cryptographic toolkit excluding threshold encryption and homomorphic tallying (Reviewer 2), and missing analysis of delegation mechanisms despite their centrality to real-world DAO participation (Reviewer 3). The formal security model also requires clarification of trust assumptions under different adversarial models.\n\nThe manuscript demonstrates sufficient scientific merit to warrant revision rather than rejection, but the combination of incomplete content and multiple substantive gaps across all reviewer perspectives necessitates major revision. The authors have laid strong foundations that, with systematic expansion of the identified missing components, could yield a valuable contribution to the field.",
