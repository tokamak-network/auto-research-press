        "Insufficient formal game-theoretic analysis of strategic voting behavior, equilibrium properties, and incentive compatibility\u2014the paper claims mechanisms have certain properties without proving or rigorously demonstrating them",
        "Sybil resistance discussion is fragmented and lacks depth on identity/reputation integration; the paper acknowledges QV's Sybil vulnerability but doesn't adequately explore solutions like proof-of-personhood, stake-weighted identity, or reputation decay mechanisms",
        "Bribery resistance analysis is superficial\u2014mentions MACI's collusion resistance but doesn't formally analyze vote-buying equilibria, the economics of dark DAOs, or the fundamental tension between verifiability and coercion resistance"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add formal mechanism design analysis including incentive compatibility proofs, characterization of Nash equilibria under different voting rules, and explicit modeling of strategic voter behavior with heterogeneous preferences",
        "Develop a dedicated section on Sybil resistance that systematically evaluates identity solutions (Proof of Humanity, BrightID, Gitcoin Passport, stake-based identity) with their tradeoffs for different voting mechanisms",
        "Include quantitative analysis of delegation dynamics\u2014the paper notes concentration concerns but should analyze delegation graphs, measure effective voting power distributions (e.g., Nakamoto coefficients), and examine delegate incentive structures"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a mechanism design perspective, this manuscript reads more as a practitioner survey than a rigorous research contribution. The core weakness is the absence of formal analysis. For instance, when discussing quadratic voting's Sybil vulnerability, the paper correctly identifies that k identities reduce cost from k\u00b2 to k, but doesn't analyze the equilibrium implications: What is the optimal Sybil strategy? How does this interact with identity verification costs? What are the welfare implications? Similarly, the conviction voting section describes the mechanism but doesn't analyze strategic timing of stake allocation, potential manipulation through coordinated stake movements, or the game-theoretic properties of the decay parameter \u03b1.\n\nThe treatment of vote-buying and bribery resistance is particularly underdeveloped given its importance. The paper mentions Votium bribes but doesn't engage with the fundamental impossibility results in the literature (e.g., that any system with verifiable votes enables vote-buying). MACI is presented as a solution, but the coordinator trust assumption is glossed over, and there's no discussion of recent advances like MACI 2.0 or alternative approaches like commit-reveal with economic penalties.\n\nThe delegation analysis misses critical mechanism design questions: How should delegation fees be structured? What prevents delegate capture or vote-selling by delegates? The paper notes concentration but doesn't propose or analyze mechanisms to mitigate it (e.g., delegation caps, quadratic delegation, time-weighted delegation).\n\nFor the reputation-based systems section, the SourceCred model is mentioned but there's no analysis of gaming resistance, reputation inflation, or the cold-start problem. How do you bootstrap reputation in a new DAO? How do you prevent reputation farming through manufactured contributions?\n\nFinally, the comparative analysis table is useful but overly simplistic. 'High/Medium/Low' ratings should be replaced with more precise characterizations, ideally with formal definitions of what constitutes Sybil resistance or plutocracy resistance in each context. The paper would benefit significantly from simulation results or empirical analysis of actual governance outcomes under different mechanisms.",

        "Gas efficiency analysis is superficial - claims of '50,000-100,000 gas per vote' lack supporting benchmarks, and no comparative analysis of storage patterns (SSTORE costs), calldata optimization, or EIP-2930 access lists for voting contracts",

        "Include detailed gas benchmarks comparing Governor Bravo, OpenZeppelin Governor, and custom implementations across different voting scenarios (single vote, batch voting, delegation changes) with actual mainnet transaction data",

        "Expand the cross-chain governance section with technical analysis of specific bridge implementations (LayerZero, Wormhole, Axelar), their trust assumptions, latency characteristics, and how voting finality interacts with cross-chain message delivery guarantees"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain systems engineering perspective, this manuscript requires significant strengthening in several technical areas. First, the gas efficiency discussion is too high-level. The claim that votes cost '50,000-100,000 gas' obscures critical implementation details. A proper analysis should distinguish between cold vs. warm storage access (21,000 vs 2,900 gas for SLOAD), the cost of checkpoint systems (which can add 20,000+ gas for SSTORE operations), and the overhead of different voting power calculation methods. The Merkle tree voting optimization mentioned deserves deeper treatment - what are the tradeoffs between on-chain commitment size, proof verification costs, and the trust assumptions of the off-chain aggregator? Second, the smart contract security analysis is notably weak for a paper on 'secure' voting mechanisms. There's no discussion of the specific vulnerabilities in governance contracts: how do you prevent reentrancy when a proposal execution calls an external contract that then attempts to vote? What about front-running attacks where miners can observe and front-run vote transactions to manipulate outcomes? The paper mentions timelocks but doesn't analyze the security of timelock implementations themselves, including the risks of admin key compromise or the interaction between timelocks and flash loan attacks (an attacker could potentially queue a malicious proposal and wait out the timelock). Third, the treatment of ZK-based voting (MACI) lacks implementation specifics. What are the actual proving times and gas costs for MACI circuits? The coordinator trust assumption is mentioned but not analyzed - what happens if the coordinator goes offline mid-vote? How do you handle coordinator key rotation? Fourth, the cross-chain governance section is essentially a placeholder. Real engineering analysis would address: How do you handle the case where a vote passes on the source chain but the bridge message fails? What's the attack surface when governance messages traverse multiple bridge hops? How do you reconcile different finality guarantees (Ethereum's ~15 minutes vs. Solana's ~400ms)? Finally, the paper would benefit from actual code analysis of deployed governance contracts. Examining the Governor Bravo implementation, OpenZeppelin's Governor, or Compound's GovernorBravoDelegate would reveal practical security considerations that theoretical analysis misses.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The formal security model (Section 2.2) conflates distinct cryptographic properties and lacks precision: 'privacy' is undefined (ballot secrecy vs. receipt-freeness vs. coercion-resistance are fundamentally different), and the relationship between verifiability types (individual, universal, end-to-end) is not articulated",
        "Treatment of ZKP constructions (Section 4.1) is superficial\u2014no discussion of the specific proof systems used (Groth16, PLONK), soundness assumptions, trusted setup requirements, or the actual ZK circuits for vote validity; MACI's security model and limitations are understated",
        "No formal threat model specification: adversary capabilities (computational bounds, corruption thresholds, network assumptions) are described informally without the precision needed to evaluate security claims"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Develop a formal security model following established frameworks (e.g., Juels-Catalano-Jakobsson for coercion-resistance, or the Cortier-Galindo-Glondu-Izabach\u00e8ne framework) with explicit definitions of ballot secrecy, verifiability, and coercion-resistance adapted to the transparent ledger setting",
        "Provide detailed analysis of ZKP constructions: specify the NP relations being proven, discuss circuit complexity, prover/verifier costs, and formally characterize what privacy guarantees MACI actually provides (it does NOT provide receipt-freeness against a colluding coordinator)",
        "Address the fundamental tension between blockchain transparency and receipt-freeness\u2014this is arguably the central open problem in cryptographic voting for DAOs and deserves dedicated treatment with discussion of approaches like deniable encryption, time-lock puzzles, or threshold decryption with honest majority assumptions"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic voting protocols perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening. The security requirements listed in Section 2.2 mix properties at different abstraction levels without formal definitions. In particular, 'privacy' as stated is ambiguous\u2014ballot secrecy (hiding vote content), receipt-freeness (inability to prove how one voted), and coercion-resistance (inability to be coerced even under threat) are distinct properties with different cryptographic requirements. The claim that ZKPs enable 'collusion resistance' in MACI is imprecise: MACI provides a weaker property where voters can change their vote after an initial submission, making bribery verification unreliable, but this is not coercion-resistance in the formal sense since a coercer present during final vote submission can still verify compliance. The manuscript should clarify that MACI requires trusting the coordinator for privacy (not just liveness), as a malicious coordinator can decrypt all votes. The discussion of homomorphic encryption omits critical details: which schemes (Paillier, BFV, BGV)? What are the concrete performance numbers? How is the decryption key managed? The Cicada reference mentions 'homomorphic time-lock puzzles' without explaining the construction or its security assumptions. For a research contribution in this space, I would expect formal security theorems (even if informal proofs), explicit computational assumptions, and comparison against established voting protocol benchmarks. The treatment of verifiability should distinguish between cast-as-intended, recorded-as-cast, and tallied-as-recorded properties. Finally, the manuscript should engage with the fundamental impossibility results in this space\u2014particularly the tension between coercion-resistance and the transparent, immutable nature of blockchain ledgers, which represents a genuine open research challenge that deserves more than passing mention.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of DAO voting mechanisms that successfully covers deployed systems with practical examples and useful comparative frameworks. All three reviewers acknowledge the paper's strengths in organization, clarity of presentation, and practical orientation\u2014particularly the effective use of the Beanstalk attack case study and the governance stack diagram. The paper serves as a useful educational resource for practitioners seeking to understand the landscape of DAO governance mechanisms.\n\nHowever, the reviewers unanimously identify a critical gap between the paper's ambitions and its analytical depth. The mechanism design analysis lacks formal game-theoretic rigor (no incentive compatibility proofs, equilibrium characterization, or strategic behavior modeling). The systems engineering perspective is underdeveloped, with superficial gas cost analysis and incomplete smart contract security treatment. Most concerning is the cryptographic analysis, which conflates distinct security properties, provides imprecise definitions, and understates limitations of constructions like MACI. The paper's treatment of fundamental tensions\u2014between transparency and privacy, verifiability and coercion-resistance, Sybil resistance and accessibility\u2014remains at a surface level inappropriate for a research contribution.\n\nThe consensus across reviewers is that this work reads more as an educational overview than a rigorous research contribution. While the practical coverage is valuable, the paper must substantially deepen its formal analysis in at least one of the three dimensions (mechanism design, systems engineering, or cryptographic protocols) to meet publication standards. The issues identified are addressable but require significant effort beyond cosmetic revision.",

    "recommendation": "The authors should decide whether this paper aims to be a practitioner-oriented survey or a research contribution with formal analysis\u2014and then commit fully to that direction. If pursuing the research track, choose one analytical lens (mechanism design, systems, or cryptography) and develop it with the rigor expected at top venues: formal definitions, proofs or rigorous arguments, quantitative analysis with real data, and precise characterization of limitations. The current breadth-over-depth approach falls short of research standards. If pursuing the survey track, explicitly position it as such, expand practical coverage, and target an appropriate venue. Two revision rounds remain, which is sufficient time for substantial improvements if the authors focus their efforts strategically.",
