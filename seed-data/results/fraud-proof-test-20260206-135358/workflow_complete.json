          "detailed_feedback": "From a Layer 2 security architecture perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid understanding of fraud proof mechanisms but falls short in critical security analysis depth. The most significant weakness is the treatment of trust assumptions as largely theoretical constructs without examining their practical implications. The '1-of-N honest' assumption is presented cleanly but the manuscript doesn't grapple with what 'honest' means operationally\u2014it requires not just honesty but also: (1) continuous monitoring infrastructure, (2) sufficient capital for bonds, (3) technical expertise to construct proofs, (4) ability to get transactions included on L1 during potential censorship, and (5) economic rationality to bear costs. The current reality is that most rollups rely on a small set of well-resourced entities (often the protocol teams themselves) for verification, which introduces significant centralization risks not adequately addressed.\n\nThe security trade-offs analysis in Section 5 lists attack vectors but lacks the rigor expected for a comprehensive security analysis. For example, the 'Delay Attack' discussion mentions BOLD's bounded resolution but doesn't analyze whether the bounds are actually sufficient given realistic attacker resources. With $10B+ TVL on Arbitrum, an attacker with substantial capital could potentially profit from even temporary disruption\u2014yet there's no quantitative analysis of attack economics. The 'Verifier's Dilemma' is mentioned but dismissed too quickly; the manuscript should examine why current systems haven't seen this problem manifest and whether it's due to solved incentives or simply insufficient time/testing.\n\nThe permissioned vs. permissionless discussion is particularly concerning from a security perspective. The manuscript correctly notes that most systems remain partially permissioned but doesn't adequately analyze the security implications. A permissioned fraud proof system fundamentally changes the trust model\u2014you're trusting the whitelisted challengers rather than relying on permissionless verification. This is a critical security trade-off that deserves much deeper analysis, including: What happens if all whitelisted challengers are compromised? How does this compare to the security of the underlying L1? What are the governance risks in the whitelist management?\n\nThe data availability section (Section 6) correctly identifies DA as critical but doesn't sufficiently analyze the security implications of the transition to blobs. With 18-day blob availability vs. 7-day challenge periods, there's only 11 days of margin\u2014what happens if L1 experiences unusual congestion or if blob pruning policies change? The manuscript should analyze these edge cases more rigorously.\n\nPositively, the technical descriptions of BOLD and Cannon are accurate and well-presented. The bisection protocol explanation is clear and the comparative analysis provides useful insights. However, for a security-focused analysis, more attention should be paid to: (1) formal verification coverage and gaps, (2) historical security incidents and near-misses, (3) economic security modeling with realistic parameters, (4) centralization risks in current deployments, and (5) the practical security posture vs. theoretical security properties. The manuscript would be significantly strengthened by incorporating threat modeling frameworks, quantitative security analysis, and more critical examination of the gap between theoretical security properties and operational reality.",

          "detailed_feedback": "As a fraud proof systems expert, I find this manuscript to be a solid comprehensive overview that would serve well as an educational resource, but it falls short of the analytical depth expected for cutting-edge research. The treatment of bond economics is particularly concerning - while you correctly identify the key incentive conditions, you don't rigorously analyze whether current implementations actually satisfy them. For instance, the condition that E[Reward_challenge] - Cost_challenge > 0 requires detailed modeling of: (1) capital lockup duration and opportunity costs, (2) gas costs for multi-round disputes under various L1 fee regimes, (3) probability of successfully claiming rewards given potential L1 censorship, and (4) the coordination costs for verifier coalitions. Your analysis would be significantly strengthened by concrete numerical examples using current protocol parameters.\n\nThe challenge window discussion, while comprehensive in listing factors, lacks the quantitative rigor needed to justify the 7-day standard. You should analyze actual proof construction times from testnet data, model the tail risks of L1 congestion (what happens during a major network event?), and consider adversarial scenarios where sequencers deliberately construct complex transactions to maximize proof generation time. The formula T_detection + T_proof_construction + T_submission + T_safety_margin needs empirical validation - what are realistic values for each term?\n\nYour treatment of interactive fraud proofs is generally strong, but the complexity analysis oversimplifies practical considerations. The O(log n) rounds is correct in theory, but each round involves non-trivial on-chain costs for state commitments, Merkle proofs, and contract execution. A more rigorous analysis would break down the gas costs per round, analyze the total cost distribution across different transaction complexities, and compare this to the theoretical maximum. Additionally, the discussion of BOLD's 'bounded time' property could be more precise about what happens when multiple malicious actors coordinate - does the bound hold under all adversarial strategies?\n\nThe verifier's dilemma section identifies the right problem but doesn't adequately address whether current solutions actually work. You mention 'altruistic verification' but don't critically analyze its sustainability. What happens as protocols scale and the cost of verification increases? Are current reward mechanisms sufficient to bootstrap a robust verifier ecosystem? The empirical data showing zero mainnet disputes should prompt deeper investigation - is this because the system works perfectly, or because there's insufficient monitoring?\n\nFinally, while your coverage of emerging trends is valuable, the discussion of ZK-optimistic hybrids would benefit from more critical analysis of the trade-offs. When does it make sense to generate ZK proofs versus relying on fraud proofs? What are the crossover points in terms of computation complexity, proof generation costs, and finality requirements? This kind of quantitative analysis would elevate the work from survey to research contribution.",

Both reviewers acknowledge the clarity and comprehensiveness of the coverage, which represents genuine value for practitioners seeking to understand this complex domain. The average score of 6.9 reflects a competent but not yet publication-ready manuscript.\n\nHowever, I find the reviewers' core concerns substantive rather than nitpicking. Both independently identify the same fundamental gap: the security and economic analysis lacks the rigor expected for a technical publication in this space. Reviewer 1's concern about superficial trust assumption analysis and Reviewer 2's critique of the bond economics treatment point to the same underlying issue\u2014the manuscript describes mechanisms well but doesn't critically analyze whether they actually achieve their security goals. For a paper positioning itself as a technical analysis of fraud proof security, this is a significant gap, not a minor presentation issue. The claim that bond mechanisms provide adequate deterrence, for instance, needs quantitative backing given the stakes involved.\n\nThat said, these weaknesses are clearly fixable. The manuscript's strong foundation in protocol mechanics means the authors have the technical understanding to deepen the analysis. The requested additions\u2014economic modeling, empirical validation of challenge windows, rigorous griefing analysis\u2014are bounded and achievable within one revision cycle.

      "author_rebuttal": "## Author Rebuttal - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank both reviewers for their thorough and constructive evaluation of our manuscript on optimistic rollup fraud proof mechanisms. The feedback demonstrates deep expertise in Layer 2 security architecture and fraud proof systems, and we are grateful for the time invested in providing such detailed commentary.\n\nBoth reviewers converge on several key themes: (1) the need for more rigorous quantitative analysis of bond economics and attack costs, (2) insufficient examination of the gap between theoretical security properties and operational reality, (3) inadequate treatment of the permissioned-to-permissionless transition, and (4) lack of empirical validation for claims about challenge windows and proof construction times. We acknowledge these as legitimate and important concerns that, if addressed, would significantly strengthen the manuscript's contribution. Our revision strategy focuses on adding quantitative rigor through concrete numerical analysis, incorporating empirical data where available, and providing more critical examination of current deployment realities versus theoretical security guarantees.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (L2 Security Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the balanced evaluation (6.4/10 average) and recognize that the reviewer's concerns center on the critical gap between our theoretical treatment and practical security implications. The reviewer correctly identifies that our security analysis, while comprehensive in scope, lacks the depth required for rigorous threat modeling.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Insufficient analysis of trust assumptions beyond the basic '1-of-N honest' model**\n   \n   - **Our response**: This is a fair and important criticism. We acknowledge that presenting the '1-of-N honest' assumption without examining its operational requirements creates an incomplete security picture. The reviewer's enumeration of practical requirements (continuous monitoring infrastructure, capital for bonds, technical expertise, L1 transaction inclusion capability, economic rationality) is precisely the analysis our manuscript should include.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (Section 4.4: \"Operational Requirements for Honest Verification\") that details:\n     - Infrastructure cost estimates for running a full verifier node (~$500-2000/month for cloud infrastructure based on current Arbitrum/Optimism node requirements)\n     - Capital requirements analysis showing minimum bond amounts and expected lockup durations\n     - Technical expertise barriers and their implications for verifier set diversity\n     - Analysis of L1 censorship resistance requirements, including examination of proposer-builder separation implications\n     - A table mapping current known verifiers by category (protocol teams, institutional operators, independent) to illustrate centralization concerns\n\n2. **Shallow analysis of attack vector economics and residual risks**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We agree that Section 5.1 identifies attack vectors without providing the quantitative analysis necessary to assess their practical viability. The reviewer's point about $10B+ TVL on Arbitrum creating potential profit opportunities from temporary disruption is well-taken.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially revise Section 5 to include:\n     - Quantitative attack cost analysis: For a delay attack under BOLD with current parameters (3.6 ETH stake, ~7 day maximum delay), we will calculate the capital required to sustain delays of various durations and compare against potential MEV extraction or market manipulation profits\n     - Break-even analysis showing at what TVL levels different attack types become economically rational\n     - Historical data on DeFi exploits and market manipulation events to contextualize realistic attacker capabilities and motivations\n     - Analysis of combined attack scenarios (e.g., delay attack + oracle manipulation)\n\n3. **Inadequate treatment of permissioned-to-permissionless transition security implications**\n   \n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that our acknowledgment of permissioned systems without rigorous security analysis is a significant gap. A permissioned fraud proof system has fundamentally different trust properties than a permissionless one, and we failed to adequately distinguish these.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 5.4: \"Security Properties Under Permissioned Operation\" covering:\n     - Explicit comparison of trust models: permissioned (trust whitelist managers + whitelisted challengers) vs. permissionless (trust 1-of-N anonymous participants)\n     - Analysis of whitelist compromise scenarios and their consequences\n     - Governance attack surface in whitelist management\n     - Comparison to L1 security properties under each model\n     - Concrete criteria for assessing permissionless readiness (verifier diversity metrics, historical uptime, capital distribution)\n\n4. **Data availability margin analysis for blob transition**\n   \n   - **Our response**: The observation about the 11-day margin between blob availability (18 days) and challenge period (7 days) deserving more rigorous edge case analysis is valid. We treated this as sufficient without examining failure modes.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 6 to include:\n     - Analysis of historical L1 congestion events and their duration\n     - Sensitivity analysis of the margin under various blob pruning policy scenarios\n     - Discussion of fallback mechanisms if blob data becomes unavailable during a dispute\n     - Recommendations for protocol-level safeguards (e.g., extending challenge periods during detected DA stress)\n\n**Minor Points**: \n\nWe will incorporate the reviewer's suggestions regarding formal verification coverage gaps and historical security incidents. We will add a subsection surveying publicly disclosed audit findings from Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, and other auditors for both Arbitrum and Optimism, categorizing vulnerabilities by type and severity. We will also include discussion of the Optimism incident in 2022 where a critical bug in the legacy fraud proof system was discovered (though never exploited), as this provides valuable context for understanding real-world security posture.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Fraud Proof Systems Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of our pedagogical approach (7.4/10 average) while acknowledging the valid criticism that the manuscript \"falls short of the analytical depth expected for cutting-edge research.\" The detailed technical feedback provides a clear roadmap for elevating the work.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Bond economics analysis lacks rigorous game-theoretic modeling**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We agree that presenting incentive conditions without quantitative analysis with realistic parameters undermines the utility of our framework. The reviewer's enumeration of required modeling components (capital lockup duration, gas costs under various fee regimes, reward probability given censorship risks, coordination costs) is comprehensive and actionable.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 4.5: \"Quantitative Bond Economics Analysis\" including:\n     - Concrete numerical example using current Arbitrum BOLD parameters: 3.6 ETH stake, ~6-7 day dispute duration, current gas prices (~20-50 gwei base), and historical L1 fee volatility\n     - Expected value calculations for honest challengers under different TVL-at-risk scenarios\n     - Capital efficiency analysis comparing BOLD's all-vs-all approach vs. hypothetical sequential dispute systems\n     - Sensitivity analysis showing how bond requirements should scale with TVL growth\n     - Discussion of opportunity cost using DeFi yield benchmarks (e.g., ETH staking returns as baseline)\n\n2. **Challenge window analysis lacks empirical validation**\n   \n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that our formula T_detection + T_proof_construction + T_submission + T_safety_margin needs empirical grounding. We relied on heuristic justification where data-driven analysis was possible.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will revise the challenge window section to include:\n     - Empirical data from Arbitrum Goerli and Optimism Goerli testnet disputes (we have identified 12 documented test disputes with timing data)\n     - Analysis of proof construction times for transactions of varying complexity based on available benchmarks from protocol documentation\n     - Historical L1 congestion analysis using data from the March 2023 and May 2023 high-fee periods, modeling worst-case submission delays\n     - Monte Carlo simulation of challenge window adequacy under adversarial conditions\n     - We acknowledge that real mainnet dispute data is unavailable (as there have been no mainnet disputes), and will clearly state this limitation\n\n3. **Insufficient griefing attack economics analysis**\n   \n   - **Our response**: This is a valid criticism. While we mentioned griefing attacks, we did not provide the capital requirement calculations needed to assess their practical threat level.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add detailed griefing analysis including:\n     - Cost to delay withdrawals by 1, 7, 14, and 30 days under BOLD's current bond structure\n     - Comparison of griefing costs pre-BOLD (under sequential dispute systems) vs. post-BOLD\n     - Analysis of whether current bonds create sufficient griefing resistance given realistic attacker motivations (e.g., competitor protocols, short sellers)\n     - Proposed metrics for \"griefing resistance ratio\" (cost to attacker / cost to users) that could be used for cross-protocol comparison\n\n4. **Interactive fraud proof complexity analysis oversimplifies practical costs**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We agree that the O(log n) characterization, while theoretically correct, obscures practically important cost considerations. \n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will expand the complexity analysis to include:\n     - Detailed gas cost breakdown per bisection round (state commitment: ~50-100k gas, Merkle proof verification: ~20-50k gas, contract execution overhead: ~30k gas)\n     - Total dispute cost distribution analysis across transaction complexity ranges\n     - Comparison of WAVM vs. MIPS verification costs for representative instruction mixes\n     - Worst-case analysis for pathological transactions designed to maximize proof complexity\n\n5. **Limited critical analysis of zero mainnet disputes**\n   \n   - **Our response**: The reviewer raises an important epistemological point. We presented the absence of mainnet disputes as evidence of security without critically examining alternative explanations.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add a discussion section examining competing hypotheses for zero disputes:\n     - Hypothesis 1: Systems are secure and fraud attempts would be detected\n     - Hypothesis 2: Insufficient economic incentive for would-be attackers given current monitoring\n     - Hypothesis 3: Insufficient monitoring infrastructure to detect sophisticated attacks\n     - Hypothesis 4: Permissioned nature of current systems deters attacks by limiting attacker anonymity\n     - We will discuss what evidence would help distinguish these hypotheses and what the implications of each would be for protocol security\n\n**Minor Points**: \n\nRegarding the ZK-optimistic hybrid analysis, we will add quantitative crossover analysis examining computation complexity thresholds where ZK proof generation becomes cost-effective versus fraud proof reliance. We will use current ZK proving costs (~$0.001-0.01 per transaction for zkSync/Scroll-style proofs) as benchmarks and analyze the trade-off curves.\n\nWe will also address the reviewer's suggestion about permissionless transition readiness metrics by proposing a concrete \"decentralization readiness scorecard\" that protocols could use, including metrics for verifier diversity, geographic distribution, capital distribution, and historical reliability.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Revisions Planned:**\n\n1. **New Section 4.4**: \"Operational Requirements for Honest Verification\" - detailed analysis of infrastructure, capital, and expertise requirements for the 1-of-N honest assumption\n\n2. **New Section 4.5**: \"Quantitative Bond Economics Analysis\" - rigorous game-theoretic modeling with concrete numerical examples using current protocol parameters\n\n3. **Substantially Revised Section 5**: Enhanced attack vector analysis with quantitative feasibility assessments, economic attack modeling, and combined attack scenario analysis\n\n4. **New Section 5.4**: \"Security Properties Under Permissioned Operation\" - explicit comparison of trust models and governance attack surfaces\n\n5. **Expanded Section 6**: Data availability margin analysis with edge case examination and historical congestion data\n\n6. **New Discussion Section**: Critical analysis of zero mainnet disputes with competing hypotheses\n\n**Clarifications and Additions:**\n\n- Empirical validation of challenge window formula using testnet dispute data and historical L1 congestion analysis\n- Detailed gas cost breakdowns for interactive fraud proof rounds\n- Griefing attack cost calculations under current bond mechanisms\n- Survey of publicly disclosed audit findings for Arbitrum and Optimism\n- ZK-optimistic hybrid crossover analysis with quantitative thresholds\n- Decentralization readiness scorecard proposal\n\n**Acknowledged Limitations:**\n\n- We will explicitly note the absence of mainnet dispute data and its implications for empirical validation\n- We will acknowledge uncertainty in attack cost estimates due to rapidly evolving L1 fee markets\n- We will clarify which security properties are theoretical versus empirically validated\n\nWe believe these revisions will address the substantive concerns raised by both reviewers while maintaining the pedagogical clarity that was noted as a strength. We are grateful for the opportunity to strengthen this work and look forward to the reviewers' assessment of our revised manuscript.",

Section 2.2's treatment of practical 1-of-N requirements and Section 2.4's bond economics analysis are exemplary.",

The treatment of permissioned vs. permissionless security properties (Section 5.3) directly addresses a critical gap from Round 1.",

This transparency significantly strengthens credibility.",

What is the decision-making process for a hard fork? Who coordinates? What are the time constraints? The $997K reputational cost threshold in Appendix C.1 is asserted but not derived from any model of social layer response.",
            "Insufficient analysis of combined attack scenarios: While individual attacks are well-analyzed, the manuscript only briefly mentions combined attacks (e.g., delay + oracle manipulation, censorship + data withholding). Real-world attackers would likely combine vectors. A more rigorous treatment would model attack trees and analyze optimal attacker strategies across multiple dimensions simultaneously.",
            "Verifier coordination assumptions need examination: The analysis assumes verifiers act independently, but coordination (or lack thereof) significantly impacts security. What if verifiers coordinate to share costs? What if they coordinate to collude? The game theory should extend to multi-agent scenarios with communication possibilities. The verifier's dilemma analysis (Section 2.5) identifies the free-rider problem but doesn't model potential coordination solutions."

          "detailed_feedback": "This revision demonstrates exceptional responsiveness to reviewer feedback and represents a significant contribution to the literature on Layer 2 security. The authors have transformed a solid but superficial overview into a rigorous, quantitatively grounded analysis that will be valuable for both researchers and practitioners.\n\nThe quantitative economic analysis is particularly strong. The break-even calculations for verifiers (Appendix C.2), the griefing attack cost analysis (Section 5.2, Attack 3), and the crossover analysis for ZK vs. fraud proofs (Section 7.1) all provide concrete, actionable insights. The recognition that 'pure economic verification is not viable' and that verifiers require additional motivations is an important finding that deserves emphasis.\n\nThe treatment of permissioned vs. permissionless security (Section 5.3) directly addresses my primary concern from Round 1. The explicit comparison of trust models and the honest acknowledgment that 'users should understand that permissioned systems have different (not necessarily worse) security properties' demonstrates intellectual maturity. The metrics for assessing permissionless readiness provide a useful framework for protocols and users.\n\nThe empirical validation efforts are commendable. While the authors correctly note the limitation of zero mainnet disputes, they've done excellent work gathering testnet data, historical congestion analysis, and audit findings. The competing hypotheses for zero disputes (Section 5.5) show critical thinking about what can and cannot be concluded from current evidence.\n\nThe remaining weaknesses are relatively minor compared to the Round 1 issues. The social layer security gap is the most significant\u2014the manuscript treats social consensus as a backstop but doesn't rigorously analyze its properties. Given that social layer intervention represents a fundamental change to the security model (from cryptographic to social), this deserves more careful treatment. The combined attack analysis gap is less critical but would strengthen the threat modeling. The verifier coordination dynamics are an interesting research direction but perhaps beyond the scope of this already comprehensive manuscript.\n\nMinor technical notes: (1) The WAVM vs. MIPS comparison (Section 4.3) could benefit from discussing the formal verification implications\u2014MIPS's simpler ISA may be easier to verify formally. (2) The blob availability margin analysis (Section 6.2) is much improved but could discuss the implications of potential blob pricing changes under high demand. (3) The ZK-optimistic convergence discussion (Section 7.1) might note that ZK proving costs are decreasing rapidly, which could shift the crossover point.\n\nOverall assessment: This manuscript now meets publication standards for a top-tier venue. The authors have demonstrated deep domain expertise, rigorous analytical thinking, and honest engagement with limitations. The quantitative analysis, empirical grounding, and practical implications make this a valuable contribution that will inform protocol design, security analysis, and user risk assessment in the Layer 2 ecosystem. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the social layer security analysis.",

          "detailed_feedback": "As a fraud proof systems expert, I am genuinely impressed by the thoroughness of this revision. The authors have not merely addressed the feedback superficially but have engaged deeply with each concern, adding substantial analytical depth throughout.\n\nThe bond economics analysis (Section 4.5) is now exemplary, providing exactly the rigorous game-theoretic modeling requested. The concrete numerical examples using current Arbitrum BOLD parameters (3.6 ETH stake, 6-7 day dispute duration, 20-50 gwei gas prices) make the analysis actionable rather than purely theoretical. The capital efficiency comparison showing BOLD's ~1:1 resource ratio versus sequential dispute systems' asymmetric costs is particularly valuable for protocol designers. The verifier's dilemma formalization revealing that k* = -0.9 (no verification in pure economic equilibrium) is an honest and important insight that many papers would gloss over.\n\nThe challenge window empirical validation represents a major improvement. The decomposition into T_detection, T_proof_construction, T_submission, and T_safety_margin with optimistic/conservative/adversarial estimates provides the data-driven analysis that was missing. The sensitivity analysis showing P(fraud succeeds) \u2248 1.1% under current parameters with realistic detection and submission probabilities is exactly the kind of quantitative risk assessment needed. The historical L1 congestion analysis noting 200+ gwei periods lasting 24-48 hours grounds the theoretical analysis in operational reality.\n\nThe security analysis transformation is remarkable. Section 5.2's attack-by-attack quantification with detailed cost tables, expected value calculations, and residual risk assessments elevates this from a survey to a rigorous security analysis. The griefing attack economics showing BOLD achieves bounded 7.4-day delay for ~10 ETH cost (100 assertions \u00d7 0.1 ETH) versus unbounded delays in sequential systems provides clear evidence of BOLD's superiority. The L1 censorship feasibility analysis noting that 7-day censorship would require ~50,400 validator collusion (implausible) versus 1-hour requiring ~300 validators (rare but possible) demonstrates sophisticated threat modeling.\n\nThe operational requirements analysis (Section 2.2) is outstanding. The infrastructure cost estimates ($2,000-5,000/month), capital requirements (1-2 ETH), and verifier concentration data (2-3 protocol teams, 3-5 infrastructure providers, 5-10 large holders) provide the practical grounding that was entirely absent in Round 1. The honest acknowledgment that these requirements create centralization risks not captured by the theoretical 1-of-N model shows intellectual honesty. The table mapping verifier types to characteristics is exactly what practitioners need to assess real-world security.\n\nThe permissioned vs permissionless security analysis (Section 5.4) directly addresses a critical gap. The explicit comparison showing permissioned systems require trust in \"N-of-M whitelisted challengers\" versus permissionless \"1-of-N (anyone)\" makes the trust model differences crystal clear. The failure mode analysis with probability/impact/mitigation for scenarios like \"all challengers compromised\" or \"challengers legally compelled\" is the kind of rigorous risk assessment that was missing.\n\nThe gas cost breakdowns for interactive fraud proofs now provide the detail requested. The per-component analysis (state commitment ~20K, Merkle proof ~50K, challenge manager logic ~30K, total ~100-200K per round) and the WAVM vs MIPS instruction-level comparison showing verification costs ranging from ~200K (arithmetic) to ~5M (precompiles) gives protocol designers concrete data for optimization.\n\nThe critical analysis of zero mainnet disputes (Section 5.5) is intellectually honest in a way that strengthens rather than weakens the manuscript. Presenting four competing hypotheses (system secure, insufficient attacker incentive, insufficient monitoring, permissioned deterrence) and acknowledging uncertainty about which explanation is correct demonstrates scientific rigor. The historical near-miss table showing audit findings (WAVM memory handling, MIPS syscall edge cases) provides valuable context about real vulnerabilities discovered pre-launch.\n\nMinor areas for enhancement: The formal verification coverage table is useful but could be more specific about what \"partial\" means - which instruction subsets or state transitions remain unverified? The ZK-optimistic crossover analysis provides a valuable 13% threshold but could be more nuanced about finality value in different applications. The blob availability analysis is strong but could explore failure mode contingencies more deeply.\n\nOverall, this revision demonstrates exceptional responsiveness to feedback and elevates the manuscript to publication quality. The quantitative rigor, empirical grounding, and critical analysis of assumptions now match the pedagogical clarity that was already a strength. This represents a significant contribution to the fraud proof systems literature and provides a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners. Score: 8.6/10 (up from 7.4/10 in Round 1).",

The +1.7 point improvement (6.9\u21928.6) reflects substantive enhancements rather than superficial changes: the authors added comprehensive quantitative analysis, empirical validation through testnet data and Monte Carlo simulations, and critically honest examination of their own assumptions. Both reviewers independently highlight the 'outstanding response to feedback' and 'exceptional depth' in areas that were previously identified as gaps\u2014bond economics, attack cost modeling, and the 1-of-N assumption analysis.\n\nThe remaining weaknesses identified by reviewers are legitimate but represent refinements rather than fundamental flaws. Reviewer 1's concerns about social layer security modeling and combined attack scenarios, and Reviewer 2's points about formal verification coverage and blob unavailability contingencies, are all valid directions for future work or minor enhancements\u2014but none represent gaps that undermine the manuscript's core contribution or reliability. Importantly, reviewers are calibrated appropriately: they acknowledge this is publication-quality work while identifying areas for potential strengthening. They are not demanding theoretical novelty inappropriate for what appears to be a comprehensive industry research analysis.\n\nFrom an editorial perspective, this manuscript now provides substantial value to both practitioners implementing fraud proof systems and researchers studying L2 security. The honest treatment of limitations (zero mainnet dispute data, competing hypotheses for dispute absence, verifier concentration concerns) actually strengthens rather than weakens the work's credibility. At Round 2 of 2, with both reviewers scoring 8.6/10 and explicitly describing the work as 'publication-quality,' continued revision would yield diminishing returns.
