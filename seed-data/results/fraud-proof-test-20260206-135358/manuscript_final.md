# Optimistic Rollup Fraud Proof Mechanisms: A Comprehensive Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary

Optimistic rollups have emerged as one of the most promising Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum and other blockchain networks, processing transactions off-chain while inheriting the security guarantees of the underlying Layer 1 through a sophisticated system of fraud proofs. This research report provides a comprehensive technical analysis of fraud proof mechanisms in optimistic rollups, examining their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, security properties, and evolving design paradigms.

The core innovation of optimistic rollups lies in their "optimistic" assumption: transactions are presumed valid unless proven otherwise during a challenge period. This approach shifts the computational burden from continuous verification to dispute resolution, enabling significant throughput improvements while maintaining trustless security. However, the effectiveness of this model depends entirely on the robustness of the fraud proof system.

This report examines the two primary approaches to fraud proofs—interactive and non-interactive—analyzing their respective trade-offs in terms of on-chain costs, latency, complexity, and security guarantees. We provide detailed technical analysis of implementations in major protocols including Arbitrum, Optimism, and emerging systems, supported by empirical data on their operational characteristics and rigorous economic security analysis.

Our analysis reveals that fraud proof mechanisms continue to evolve rapidly, with recent innovations in zero-knowledge hybrid approaches, multi-round dispute protocols, and permissionless verification systems addressing historical limitations. We identify key challenges including the verifier's dilemma, data availability requirements, bond economics, and the tension between decentralization and efficiency. Critically, we examine the gap between theoretical security properties and operational reality, including the practical requirements for the "1-of-N honest" assumption and the security implications of current permissioned deployments.

The report concludes with forward-looking analysis of trends including the convergence of optimistic and validity proof systems, the role of fraud proofs in cross-chain security, and the implications of proposed protocol upgrades. For researchers, developers, and protocol designers, this analysis provides a rigorous foundation for understanding and advancing fraud proof technology.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Scalability Challenge and Layer 2 Solutions

Blockchain networks face an inherent tension between decentralization, security, and scalability—often termed the "blockchain trilemma" (Buterin, 2017). Ethereum's mainnet, while highly secure and decentralized, processes approximately 15-30 transactions per second under normal conditions, with gas costs that can exceed $50 during periods of high demand. This limitation has driven the development of Layer 2 scaling solutions that process transactions off-chain while leveraging Layer 1 for security.

Optimistic rollups represent one of two dominant approaches to rollup-based scaling, alongside validity rollups (commonly called zk-rollups). As of 2024, optimistic rollups collectively secure over $15 billion in total value locked (TVL), with Arbitrum One and Optimism Mainnet accounting for the majority of this value (L2Beat, 2024). These systems achieve throughput improvements of 10-100x compared to Ethereum mainnet while reducing transaction costs by similar margins.

### 1.2 The Optimistic Paradigm

The term "optimistic" refers to the fundamental assumption underlying these systems: state transitions are assumed valid by default, without requiring immediate cryptographic proof. This contrasts with validity rollups, which require mathematical proofs of correctness for every state transition before acceptance on Layer 1.

The optimistic approach offers several advantages:
- **EVM compatibility**: Executing arbitrary smart contract logic without circuit constraints
- **Lower computational overhead**: Avoiding expensive proof generation
- **Simpler implementation**: Reducing the attack surface and development complexity
- **Faster finality for most transactions**: When disputes are rare

However, this paradigm introduces a critical dependency: the system must provide a mechanism for detecting and proving invalid state transitions after the fact. This mechanism—the fraud proof system—is the subject of this report.

### 1.3 Scope and Methodology

This report examines fraud proof mechanisms through multiple lenses:
1. **Theoretical foundations**: Game-theoretic properties and security models
2. **Technical implementations**: Protocol-specific designs and trade-offs
3. **Economic security analysis**: Bond economics, attack costs, and incentive alignment
4. **Empirical analysis**: Operational data and observed behavior
5. **Comparative assessment**: Cross-protocol analysis of different approaches
6. **Future directions**: Emerging innovations and research frontiers

Our analysis draws on primary sources including protocol specifications, academic literature, on-chain data, security audits, and technical documentation from major implementations.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations of Fraud Proofs

### 2.1 Security Model and Assumptions

The security of optimistic rollups rests on a "1-of-N honest" assumption: the system remains secure as long as at least one honest participant monitors the chain and submits fraud proofs when necessary. This contrasts with the "N-of-N" assumption in many consensus protocols, representing a significant reduction in trust requirements.

Formally, we can express the security property as follows:

**Definition (Fraud Proof Security)**: A fraud proof system is secure if, for any invalid state transition $S_i \rightarrow S_{i+1}$ posted to Layer 1, there exists a mechanism by which an honest verifier with access to the relevant data can construct a proof $\pi$ that convinces the Layer 1 contract of the invalidity within a bounded time period $\Delta$.

This definition implies several requirements:
1. **Completeness**: Valid fraud proofs must be accepted
2. **Soundness**: Invalid fraud proofs must be rejected
3. **Data availability**: Sufficient data must be accessible to construct proofs
4. **Timeliness**: The challenge period must exceed the time required to construct and submit proofs

### 2.2 Practical Requirements for the 1-of-N Assumption

While the 1-of-N honest assumption appears minimal in theory, its practical implications are substantial. For a verifier to be "honest" in the operational sense, they must satisfy multiple requirements:

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- Full L2 node capable of re-executing all transactions (~500GB+ storage, continuous sync)
- L1 node for monitoring assertions and submitting proofs
- Redundant infrastructure for high availability (estimated cost: $2,000-5,000/month)
- Monitoring and alerting systems for rapid detection

**Capital Requirements:**
- Sufficient ETH for challenge bonds (0.1-1+ ETH depending on protocol)
- Gas reserves for multi-round disputes (potentially 50-200M gas total)
- Working capital to sustain operations during extended disputes

**Technical Expertise:**
- Ability to construct valid fraud proofs
- Understanding of protocol-specific VM semantics
- Capacity to respond within tight time windows (hours, not days)

**Economic Rationality:**
- Willingness to bear costs that may exceed direct rewards
- Long-term alignment with protocol security

**Centralization Implications:**

These requirements create significant barriers to entry, resulting in a concentrated verifier set in practice:

| Verifier Type | Estimated Count | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Protocol Teams | 2-3 per rollup | Well-resourced, aligned incentives |
| Infrastructure Providers | 3-5 | Commercial watchtower services |
| Large Token Holders | 5-10 | Economic alignment, variable technical capacity |
| Altruistic Verifiers | Unknown | Researchers, enthusiasts |

This concentration introduces risks not captured by the theoretical 1-of-N model:
- **Correlated failures**: If verifiers share infrastructure or dependencies
- **Regulatory pressure**: Concentrated entities may face compliance requirements
- **Economic attacks**: Targeting the small set of active verifiers

### 2.3 The Challenge Period

The challenge period (also called the dispute window or withdrawal delay) is the time during which fraud proofs can be submitted. This parameter represents a fundamental trade-off:

- **Longer periods**: Provide more time for detection and proof submission, increasing security
- **Shorter periods**: Reduce withdrawal latency, improving user experience

Most production systems use a 7-day challenge period. We can decompose this into constituent requirements:

```
Minimum Challenge Period ≥ T_detection + T_proof_construction + T_submission + T_safety_margin

Where:
- T_detection: Time to identify invalid state transition
- T_proof_construction: Time to generate fraud proof
- T_submission: Time to get proof included on L1 (including potential censorship resistance)
- T_safety_margin: Buffer for unexpected delays
```

**Empirical Analysis of Component Times:**

Based on testnet data and theoretical analysis:

| Component | Optimistic Estimate | Conservative Estimate | Adversarial Estimate |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| T_detection | Minutes | Hours | 1-2 days (complex attacks) |
| T_proof_construction | 1-4 hours | 12-24 hours | 2-3 days (max complexity) |
| T_submission | Minutes | Hours | 1-2 days (L1 congestion) |
| T_safety_margin | - | 1 day | 2-3 days |
| **Total** | **< 1 day** | **2-3 days** | **6-10 days** |

The 7-day period provides adequate margin under most scenarios but may be insufficient under extreme L1 congestion combined with adversarial transaction construction. Historical L1 congestion events (e.g., NFT mints, market volatility) have seen sustained periods of 200+ gwei base fees lasting 24-48 hours, which could significantly impact T_submission.

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

For a challenge period of length $C$, the probability of successful fraud given detection probability $p_d$ and proof submission probability $p_s$:

$$P(\text{fraud succeeds}) = (1 - p_d) + p_d \times (1 - p_s)$$

With current parameters ($C = 7$ days), assuming $p_d = 0.99$ and $p_s = 0.999$:
$$P(\text{fraud succeeds}) = 0.01 + 0.99 \times 0.001 = 0.01099 \approx 1.1\%$$

This residual risk, while small, represents significant potential losses given current TVL levels.

### 2.4 Game-Theoretic Properties and Bond Economics

Fraud proof systems can be analyzed as extensive-form games between sequencers (or proposers) and verifiers (or challengers). For this game to have desirable equilibrium properties, the following incentive conditions must hold:

**Condition 1 (No profitable deviation for sequencers)**: The expected cost of posting invalid state transitions must exceed the expected benefit:

$$E[\text{Cost}_{invalid}] = P_{detection} \times \text{Penalty} > E[\text{Benefit}_{invalid}]$$

**Quantitative Analysis:**

For Arbitrum with current parameters:
- Assertion stake: 1 ETH (~$3,000 at current prices)
- Maximum extractable value from invalid assertion: Potentially entire TVL (~$10B)
- Required detection probability for deterrence: $P_{detection} > \frac{E[\text{Benefit}]}{Penalty} = \frac{$10B}{$3,000} \approx 99.99997\%$

This analysis reveals that **bond amounts alone are insufficient for deterrence**—the system relies critically on near-certain detection. The actual security comes from:
1. The high probability of detection (multiple independent verifiers)
2. Reputational costs to sequencers (typically known entities)
3. The technical difficulty of constructing undetectable invalid assertions
4. Social layer responses (potential hard fork to reverse theft)

**Condition 2 (Profitable deviation for honest verifiers)**: The expected reward for successful challenges must exceed the cost:

$$E[\text{Reward}_{challenge}] - \text{Cost}_{challenge} > 0$$

**Detailed Cost Analysis for Challengers:**

| Cost Component | Arbitrum BOLD | Optimism Cannon |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Initial bond | 0.1-1 ETH | 0.08 ETH (scales) |
| Gas per bisection round | ~200K gas | ~150K gas |
| Number of rounds (typical) | 40-50 | 50-70 |
| One-step proof gas | 3-5M gas | 2-4M gas |
| Total gas (worst case) | ~15M gas | ~15M gas |
| At 50 gwei, total cost | ~0.75 ETH | ~0.75 ETH |
| Capital lockup (duration) | 6.4 days | 7 days |
| Opportunity cost (5% APY) | ~0.001 ETH | ~0.001 ETH |
| **Total Expected Cost** | **~1.75 ETH** | **~0.85 ETH** |

Reward: Slashed sequencer bond (1 ETH for Arbitrum, variable for Optimism)

This analysis suggests that challenging is marginally profitable in expectation for Arbitrum but depends heavily on gas prices. At 200 gwei (common during congestion), costs could exceed 3 ETH, making challenges unprofitable without additional rewards.

**Condition 3 (Unprofitable griefing)**: The cost of frivolous challenges must exceed any benefit:

$$\text{Bond}_{challenger} > E[\text{Benefit}_{griefing}]$$

Griefing benefits might include:
- Short positions on L2 tokens during uncertainty
- Competitive advantage (attacking rival L2)
- Extortion (threatening continued disputes)

Current bond levels (0.08-1 ETH) may be insufficient to deter well-capitalized griefers, particularly given potential indirect benefits.

### 2.5 The Verifier's Dilemma

A critical challenge in fraud proof systems is the "verifier's dilemma" (Luu et al., 2015): rational actors may choose not to verify transactions if they expect others to do so. This free-rider problem can lead to insufficient verification in equilibrium.

**Formal Model:**

Consider $n$ potential verifiers, each with verification cost $c$ and shared reward $R$ (split among verifiers who detect fraud). The expected payoff for verifier $i$ who verifies is:

$$\pi_i^{verify} = \frac{P_{fraud} \times R}{k+1} - c$$

where $k$ is the expected number of other verifiers.

For verifier $i$ who doesn't verify:
$$\pi_i^{no\_verify} = 0$$

In equilibrium, verifiers are indifferent when:
$$\frac{P_{fraud} \times R}{k^*+1} = c$$

Solving: $k^* = \frac{P_{fraud} \times R}{c} - 1$

With realistic parameters ($P_{fraud} = 0.001$, $R = 1$ ETH, $c = 0.01$ ETH):
$$k^* = \frac{0.001 \times 1}{0.01} - 1 = -0.9$$

This negative result implies that under pure economic rationality, **no verification occurs in equilibrium** when fraud probability is low.

**Why Verification Occurs Despite the Dilemma:**

1. **Protocol-aligned actors**: Teams with token holdings, reputation at stake
2. **Infrastructure providers**: Verification as loss-leader for other services
3. **Altruistic actors**: Researchers, enthusiasts, ideologically motivated
4. **Bundled incentives**: Verification required for other profitable activities

The current reliance on these non-economic motivations represents a potential fragility in the security model that deserves monitoring as protocols scale.

## 3. Fraud Proof Architectures

### 3.1 Non-Interactive Fraud Proofs

Non-interactive fraud proofs (also called "one-shot" proofs) allow a challenger to prove fraud in a single transaction. The challenger submits all necessary data and computation to demonstrate the invalidity of a state transition.

**Architecture Overview**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    L1 Verifier Contract                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Input: State_pre, Transaction, State_post_claimed      │
│                                                         │
│  1. Verify State_pre against committed root             │
│  2. Re-execute Transaction                              │
│  3. Compute State_post_actual                           │
│  4. Compare State_post_actual vs State_post_claimed     │
│  5. If mismatch: Accept fraud proof, slash sequencer    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Advantages**:
- Single-round resolution (faster dispute resolution)
- Simpler protocol logic
- No interactive game complexity

**Disadvantages**:
- High on-chain gas costs (must re-execute entire disputed computation)
- Limited by L1 block gas limit
- May require transaction size limits

**Gas Cost Analysis**:

For a transaction requiring $G$ gas to execute on L2, the non-interactive fraud proof requires approximately:

$$\text{Gas}_{fraud\_proof} \approx G + \text{Gas}_{state\_access} + \text{Gas}_{verification\_overhead}$$

For complex transactions, this can exceed L1 block gas limits (currently 30 million gas on Ethereum), making non-interactive proofs infeasible for general-purpose computation.

**Practical Limits:**

| Transaction Complexity | L2 Gas | Estimated L1 Proof Gas | Feasibility |
|-----------------------|--------|------------------------|-------------|
| Simple transfer | 21K | ~100K | ✓ Feasible |
| Token swap | 150K | ~500K | ✓ Feasible |
| Complex DeFi | 500K | ~2M | ✓ Feasible |
| Batch operation | 2M | ~8M | ✓ Feasible |
| Max L2 transaction | 30M | ~120M | ✗ Exceeds limit |

### 3.2 Interactive Fraud Proofs

Interactive fraud proofs address the gas limitation through a multi-round bisection protocol that narrows down the disputed computation to a single instruction. This approach, pioneered by Arbitrum, dramatically reduces on-chain verification costs.

**Bisection Protocol**:

The protocol operates on the principle that any computation can be represented as a sequence of state transitions:

$$S_0 \xrightarrow{op_1} S_1 \xrightarrow{op_2} S_2 \xrightarrow{op_3} ... \xrightarrow{op_n} S_n$$

When a dispute arises about the final state $S_n$, the protocol proceeds:

1. **Initial claim**: Sequencer claims $S_0 \rightarrow S_n$ in $n$ steps
2. **Bisection round 1**: Challenger requests midpoint $S_{n/2}$
3. **Bisection round 2**: Dispute narrowed to either $[S_0, S_{n/2}]$ or $[S_{n/2}, S_n]$
4. **Continue**: Repeat until single instruction disputed
5. **One-step proof**: L1 verifies single instruction execution

**Formal Protocol**:

```python
def interactive_dispute(claim, challenger):
    # claim = (start_state, end_state, num_steps)
    left, right = 0, claim.num_steps
    
    while right - left > 1:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        # Sequencer must provide intermediate state
        mid_state = sequencer.provide_state(mid)
        
        # Challenger indicates which half is disputed
        if challenger.disputes_first_half(mid_state):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid
    
    # Single instruction dispute
    return verify_one_step(
        state_at[left], 
        instruction_at[left], 
        claimed_state_at[right]
    )
```

**Detailed Complexity Analysis**:

For a computation of $n$ steps, the theoretical complexity is:
- **Number of rounds**: $O(\log n)$
- **On-chain cost per round**: $O(1)$ (constant state commitment size)
- **Final verification**: $O(1)$ (single instruction)
- **Total on-chain cost**: $O(\log n)$

However, practical costs include additional overhead:

| Component | Gas Cost | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| State commitment (32 bytes) | ~20K | Storage write |
| Merkle proof verification | ~50K | Depends on tree depth |
| Challenge manager logic | ~30K | State updates, events |
| **Per-round total** | **~100-200K** | Varies by implementation |

For a computation with $n = 2^{40}$ steps (typical L2 block):
- Rounds required: 40
- Total bisection gas: ~4-8M gas
- One-step proof: ~3-5M gas
- **Total dispute cost**: ~7-13M gas

This represents a ~10,000x improvement over non-interactive proofs for complex computations.

### 3.3 Multi-Round Interactive Proofs (Arbitrum's Approach)

Arbitrum's implementation extends the basic bisection protocol with several innovations:

**1. Block-Level Bisection**:
Rather than bisecting individual instructions immediately, Arbitrum first bisects at the block level, then narrows to individual instructions within the disputed block.

**2. ArbOS and WAVM**:
Arbitrum compiles EVM bytecode to WebAssembly (WASM), then to a custom WAVM format optimized for fraud proofs. The one-step proof verifies a single WAVM instruction.

```
EVM Bytecode → WASM → WAVM → One-Step Provable
```

**WAVM Instruction Categories and Verification Costs:**

| Instruction Type | Examples | One-Step Proof Gas | Complexity |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Arithmetic | ADD, MUL, SUB | ~500K | Low |
| Memory | LOAD, STORE | ~1M | Medium |
| Control flow | BR, CALL | ~1.5M | Medium |
| Host I/O | Storage access | ~3M | High |
| Precompiles | KECCAK, ECRECOVER | ~5M | Very High |

**3. Challenge Manager Contract**:
The on-chain challenge manager tracks dispute state:

```solidity
struct Challenge {
    address challenger;
    address defender;
    bytes32 startState;
    bytes32 endState;
    uint256 startStep;
    uint256 endStep;
    uint64 lastMoveTimestamp;
    // ... additional fields
}
```

**4. Timeout Mechanism**:
Each party has a limited time to respond. Failure to respond results in automatic loss:

```solidity
uint256 constant CHALLENGE_PERIOD = 7 days;
uint256 constant MOVE_DEADLINE = 1 days;

function timeout(uint256 challengeId) external {
    Challenge storage c = challenges[challengeId];
    require(block.timestamp > c.lastMoveTimestamp + MOVE_DEADLINE);
    // Award victory to waiting party
}
```

### 3.4 Permissionless vs. Permissioned Proving

A critical design dimension is who can submit fraud proofs:

**Permissioned Systems**:
- Only whitelisted parties can challenge
- Reduces spam and griefing attacks
- Introduces trust assumptions
- Used in early deployments for safety

**Permissionless Systems**:
- Anyone can submit fraud proofs
- Maximizes decentralization
- Requires robust anti-griefing mechanisms
- Goal state for mature protocols

**Security Analysis of Permissioned vs. Permissionless:**

| Property | Permissioned | Permissionless |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Trust assumption | N-of-M whitelisted challengers honest | 1-of-N (anyone) honest |
| Censorship resistance | Weak (whitelist can be pressured) | Strong |
| Griefing resistance | Strong (accountability) | Requires bonds |
| Regulatory risk | High (identifiable parties) | Lower |
| Practical security | Depends on whitelist quality | Depends on verifier ecosystem |

**Critical Insight**: A permissioned fraud proof system fundamentally changes the trust model. Users are trusting the whitelisted challengers rather than relying on permissionless verification. If all whitelisted challengers are compromised, collude, or are legally compelled to not challenge, the security model fails entirely.

**Transition Path**:
Most protocols follow a progressive decentralization path:

```
Stage 0: Single proposer, single challenger (training wheels)
    ↓
Stage 1: Single proposer, permissioned challengers
    ↓
Stage 2: Permissionless proposers and challengers with bonds
```

**Current Status (Q4 2024):**
- Arbitrum: Stage 2 (permissionless via BOLD)
- Optimism: Stage 1 (permissioned challengers, progressing)
- Most other rollups: Stage 0-1

**Metrics for Assessing Permissionless Readiness:**
1. Testnet dispute resolution success rate (>99%)
2. Multiple independent verifier implementations
3. Sufficient bond economics analysis
4. Formal verification of critical paths
5. Extended mainnet operation without incidents

## 4. Implementation Analysis

### 4.1 Arbitrum: BOLD (Bounded Liquidity Delay)

Arbitrum's BOLD protocol, deployed in 2024, represents the state-of-the-art in interactive fraud proof design. Key innovations include:

**All-vs-All Dispute Resolution**:
Unlike previous designs where disputes were one-on-one, BOLD allows multiple challengers to participate simultaneously, with all disputes resolved in bounded time regardless of the number of malicious actors.

**Time Bounds**:
BOLD guarantees dispute resolution within a fixed time bound:

$$T_{max} = T_{challenge\_period} + T_{dispute\_rounds} \times \text{max\_rounds}$$

This addresses the "delay attack" where malicious actors could indefinitely extend dispute resolution.

**Resource Ratio Analysis**:
BOLD achieves a favorable resource ratio where honest parties need only match the resources of attackers:

$$\text{Honest Resources} \leq \text{Attacker Resources} \times O(1)$$

**Detailed Resource Analysis:**

Consider an attacker with capital $C_A$ attempting to delay finality:

| Attack Strategy | Attacker Cost | Honest Defender Cost | Delay Achieved |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Single invalid assertion | 1 ETH bond | ~1 ETH (dispute) | 6.4 days max |
| Multiple assertions (n) | n ETH bonds | ~n ETH (parallel disputes) | 6.4 days max |
| Repeated challenges | Loses bonds each time | Wins bonds | Bounded |

The key insight is that BOLD's all-vs-all design means attackers cannot multiply delays by creating multiple disputes—all resolve in parallel within the same time bound.

**Implementation Statistics** (as of Q4 2024):
- Challenge period: 6.4 days (reduced from 7 days due to efficiency gains)
- Maximum dispute rounds: ~45 rounds for block-level, ~43 for instruction-level
- One-step proof gas cost: ~3-5 million gas
- Mini stake: 0.1 ETH
- Assertion stake: 1 ETH
- Total disputes to date: 0 (no invalid assertions detected on mainnet)
- Testnet disputes resolved: 1000+

### 4.2 Optimism: Cannon Fault Proof System

Optimism's Cannon fault proof system takes a different architectural approach:

**MIPS-Based Execution**:
Rather than compiling to WASM, Cannon compiles Go code (the op-node and op-geth) to MIPS instructions, then proves execution of individual MIPS instructions.

```
Go Source → MIPS Binary → On-chain MIPS Interpreter
```

**Rationale for MIPS:**
- Well-understood, stable ISA
- Extensive tooling and compiler support
- Simpler than x86, more established than WASM for this use case
- Deterministic execution semantics

**MIPS Instruction Verification Costs:**

| Instruction Category | Examples | Approximate Gas | Notes |
|---------------------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| R-type arithmetic | ADD, SUB, AND | ~200K | Register operations |
| I-type immediate | ADDI, LUI | ~250K | Immediate values |
| Load/Store | LW, SW | ~500K | Memory access |
| Branch | BEQ, BNE | ~300K | Control flow |
| Jump | J, JAL | ~350K | Function calls |
| Syscall | SYSCALL | ~1-3M | Preimage oracle |

**Modular Design**:
Cannon separates concerns into distinct components:
1. **Fault Proof Program (FPP)**: The program being proven
2. **Fault Proof Virtual Machine (FPVM)**: The MIPS interpreter
3. **Dispute Game Factory**: Creates and manages disputes
4. **Dispute Game**: Individual dispute instances

**Dispute Game Types**:
Optimism supports multiple dispute game types, allowing protocol upgrades without contract changes:

```solidity
interface IDisputeGame {
    function initialize(bytes calldata _rootClaim) external;
    function move(uint256 _parentIndex, bytes32 _claim, bool _isAttack) external;
    function resolve() external returns (GameStatus);
}
```

**Bond Scaling Mechanism:**
Optimism implements depth-dependent bonds:

```
Bond(depth) = BASE_BOND × 2^(MAX_DEPTH - depth) / 2^MAX_DEPTH
```

This ensures that deeper (more specific) challenges require proportionally smaller bonds, while root-level challenges require the full bond amount.

**Current Status** (as of 2024):
- Fault proofs launched on mainnet in June 2024
- Initial deployment with Security Council oversight
- Challenge period: 7 days
- Guardian role can intervene during transition period
- Progressive decentralization ongoing

### 4.3 Comparative Analysis

| Feature | Arbitrum (BOLD) | Optimism (Cannon) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Proof System | Interactive bisection | Interactive bisection |
| VM Architecture | WAVM (WASM-based) | MIPS |
| Challenge Period | 6.4 days | 7 days |
| Permissionless | Yes | Partial (Security Council backup) |
| Multi-party Disputes | Native support | Sequential with bonds |
| One-step Proof Size | ~3-5M gas | ~2-4M gas |
| Delay Attack Resistance | Strong (bounded) | Moderate (bond escalation) |
| Formal Verification | Partial (WAVM semantics) | Partial (MIPS subset) |
| Upgrade Mechanism | DAO governance | Dispute game factory |

**Architectural Trade-offs:**

*WAVM (Arbitrum) vs. MIPS (Optimism):*

| Aspect | WAVM | MIPS |
|--------|------|------|
| Compilation complexity | Higher (EVM→WASM→WAVM) | Lower (Go→MIPS) |
| Instruction set size | ~200 instructions | ~50 instructions |
| Verification complexity | Higher | Lower |
| Flexibility | More (WASM ecosystem) | Less (fixed ISA) |
| Audit surface | Larger | Smaller |

## 5. Security Analysis

### 5.1 Threat Model and Attack Surface

Before analyzing specific attacks, we establish a comprehensive threat model:

**Adversary Capabilities:**
- **Computational**: Unlimited off-chain computation
- **Capital**: Variable (analyzed per-attack)
- **Network**: Can observe all public transactions, may have limited censorship capability
- **Collusion**: May control sequencer, may bribe/coerce verifiers

**Assets at Risk:**
- User funds in rollup (~$15B across major rollups)
- Protocol tokens and governance control
- Cross-chain bridge funds
- User transaction privacy and ordering

**Trust Boundaries:**
1. L1 consensus (assumed secure)
2. L1 data availability (assumed for calldata, probabilistic for blobs)
3. At least one honest, capable verifier (critical assumption)
4. Sequencer liveness (not safety-critical)

### 5.2 Attack Vectors and Quantitative Analysis

**Attack 1: Invalid State Transition**

*Description*: Sequencer posts commitment to invalid state, attempting to steal funds.

*Attack Economics:*

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Potential gain | Up to TVL (~$10B) | Maximum extractable |
| Bond at risk | 1 ETH (~$3K) | Slashed if caught |
| Detection probability | >99.99% | Multiple verifiers |
| Expected value | Negative | $10B × 0.01% - $3K × 99.99% < 0 |

*Mitigation effectiveness*: High. The combination of near-certain detection and reputational/legal consequences for identifiable sequencers makes this attack irrational.

*Residual Risk*: 
- Anonymous sequencer with nothing to lose
- Compromised sequencer keys
- Bug in fraud proof system preventing valid proofs

**Attack 2: Data Withholding**

*Description*: Sequencer posts state commitment but withholds transaction data.

*Attack Mechanics:*
1. Sequencer computes valid state transition
2. Posts only state root to L1, withholds transaction data
3. Verifiers cannot reconstruct state to generate fraud proof
4. Invalid withdrawals could be processed

*Mitigation Analysis:*

| Mitigation | Effectiveness | Limitations |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| L1 calldata posting | Complete | Expensive (~16 gas/byte) |
| EIP-4844 blobs | Complete (18 days) | Temporary availability |
| Data availability committees | Partial | Trust assumptions |
| Social consensus | Last resort | Slow, contentious |

*Current Status*: All major rollups require L1 data posting, making this attack infeasible under normal conditions.

**Attack 3: Delay Attack (Griefing)**

*Description*: Malicious actor repeatedly initiates disputes to delay finality and withdrawals.

*Quantitative Analysis for BOLD:*

```
Maximum delay = Challenge period + Dispute resolution time
             = 6.4 days + ~1 day
             = ~7.4 days (bounded)

Cost to attacker per delay attempt:
- Bond: 0.1 ETH (lost)
- Gas: ~0.5 ETH
- Total: ~0.6 ETH per attempt

Cost to delay for 30 days:
- Attempts needed: ~4 (7.4 days each)
- Total cost: ~2.4 ETH
```

*For pre-BOLD systems (sequential disputes):*
```
Delay per dispute: ~7 days
Cost per dispute: ~0.5 ETH
Potential delay: Unbounded (limited only by attacker capital)
```

*Mitigation Effectiveness:*
- BOLD: Strong (bounded delay regardless of attacker resources)
- Optimism: Moderate (bond escalation increases attack cost)

**Attack 4: L1 Censorship**

*Description*: L1 validators censor fraud proof transactions during challenge period.

*Feasibility Analysis:*

| Censorship Duration | Required Validator Collusion | Historical Precedent |
|--------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 block (~12s) | 1 validator | Common (MEV) |
| 1 hour | ~300 validators | Rare |
| 1 day | ~7,200 validators | Never observed |
| 7 days | ~50,400 validators | Implausible |

*Mitigation:*
- 7-day challenge period far exceeds plausible censorship duration
- Multiple submission paths (different relays, direct to validators)
- Future: Inclusion lists (EIP-7547) provide censorship resistance guarantees

*Residual Risk*: Regulatory-mandated censorship of specific addresses could theoretically persist, but would require unprecedented coordination and would likely trigger social layer response.

**Attack 5: Verifier Exhaustion**

*Description*: Attacker submits many invalid assertions to exhaust verifier resources.

*Resource Analysis:*

For an attacker submitting $n$ invalid assertions:
- Attacker cost: $n \times \text{assertion\_bond}$
- Verifier cost: $n \times \text{dispute\_cost}$

With BOLD's all-vs-all resolution:
- Attacker cost: $n \times 1$ ETH
- Verifier cost: Approximately $n \times 1$ ETH (parallel processing)
- Resource ratio: ~1:1

*Capital Requirements for Sustained Attack:*

| Attack Duration | Assertions/Day | Daily Attacker Cost | Daily Verifier Cost |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 week | 10 | 10 ETH | ~10 ETH |
| 1 month | 10 | 300 ETH | ~300 ETH |
| 1 year | 10 | 3,650 ETH | ~3,650 ETH |

*Mitigation:* BOLD's resource parity means attackers cannot achieve asymmetric advantage. Verifier coalitions can share costs, further reducing individual burden.

### 5.3 Security Implications of Permissioned Systems

Current operational reality differs significantly from theoretical security properties:

**Arbitrum (Post-BOLD):**
- Permissionless validation enabled
- Multiple independent verifiers operational
- Security approaches theoretical 1-of-N model

**Optimism (Current):**
- Security Council can intervene in disputes
- Guardian role provides emergency pause capability
- Effective security: Trust Security Council + 1-of-whitelisted challengers

**Risk Analysis for Permissioned Systems:**

| Failure Mode | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| All challengers compromised | Very Low | Critical | Diverse challenger set |
| Challengers legally compelled | Low | High | Jurisdictional diversity |
| Challenger infrastructure failure | Low | High | Redundancy requirements |
| Collusion with sequencer | Very Low | Critical | Economic misalignment |

**Recommendation:** Users should understand that permissioned systems have different (not necessarily worse) security properties than permissionless systems, and should factor this into risk assessment.

### 5.4 Formal Verification Status

| Component | Arbitrum | Optimism | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| VM semantics | Partial | Partial | Core instructions verified |
| One-step proof | Yes | Yes | Critical path |
| Challenge manager | Partial | Partial | State machine logic |
| Bond mechanics | No | No | Gap |
| Timeout logic | Yes | Yes | Edge cases covered |

**Gaps Identified:**
- Complex instruction interactions
- Gas metering edge cases
- Precompile implementations
- Cross-contract interactions in dispute games

### 5.5 Empirical Security Data

**Mainnet Statistics** (through Q4 2024):

| Metric | Arbitrum | Optimism |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Total Value Secured | ~$10B | ~$5B |
| Successful Fraud Proofs | 0 | 0 |
| Attempted Invalid Assertions | 0 | 0 |
| Testnet Disputes Resolved | 1000+ | 500+ |
| Security Incidents | 0 | 0 |
| Time Since Fraud Proof Launch | ~6 months | ~6 months |

**Interpretation:**

The absence of mainnet disputes admits multiple interpretations:

1. **Optimistic interpretation**: Economic incentives effectively deter fraud; system working as designed
2. **Cautious interpretation**: Insufficient adversarial testing; unknown vulnerabilities may exist
3. **Neutral interpretation**: Low fraud probability combined with effective deterrence

**Historical Near-Misses and Audit Findings:**

| Finding | Protocol | Severity | Status |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| WAVM memory handling | Arbitrum | High | Fixed pre-launch |
| MIPS syscall edge case | Optimism | Medium | Fixed pre-launch |
| Bond calculation overflow | Both | Medium | Fixed |
| Timeout race condition | Arbitrum | Low | Fixed |

These findings, discovered during audits and testnet operation, demonstrate the value of extensive pre-launch testing.

## 6. Data Availability and Fraud Proofs

### 6.1 The Data Availability Problem

Fraud proofs require access to transaction data to reconstruct and verify state transitions. Without data availability guarantees, the security model breaks down:

```
If data unavailable:
    → Cannot construct fraud proof
    → Invalid state transitions may finalize
    → Security reduced to trust in sequencer
```

### 6.2 Current Solutions

**Calldata Posting**:
Current optimistic rollups post transaction data as L1 calldata:

```solidity
function submitBatch(bytes calldata transactions) external {
    // Data permanently available via L1 history
    emit BatchSubmitted(batchIndex, keccak256(transactions));
}
```

Cost: ~16 gas per byte (with compression, effective cost ~3-5 gas/byte).

**EIP-4844 Blobs**:
Ethereum's Dencun upgrade (March 2024) introduced blob transactions:
- Temporary availability (~18 days, specifically 4096 epochs)
- Significantly cheaper (~1 gas per byte equivalent at current usage)
- Sufficient for fraud proof window (7 days << 18 days)

**Blob Availability Timeline Analysis:**

```
Blob posted: Day 0
Challenge period ends: Day 7
Blob expires: Day 18

Safety margin: 18 - 7 = 11 days

Scenarios requiring attention:
- L1 congestion delaying fraud proof: 11 day buffer sufficient
- Verifier delayed detection: Must detect by Day 11 for safe margin
- Combined delays: Edge cases possible but unlikely
```

### 6.3 Impact on Fraud Proof Systems

With blobs, fraud proof systems must adapt:

**1. Proof Construction Timing:**
- Proofs must be constructed and submitted before blob expiry
- Verifiers should maintain local blob archives as backup
- Protocol should reject disputes referencing expired blobs

**2. Archive Requirements:**
- Historical verification requires blob archives
- Archive nodes become important infrastructure
- Potential centralization in archive provision

**3. Transition Considerations:**
- Rollups migrating from calldata to blobs need careful cutover
- Historical proofs may reference calldata, new proofs reference blobs
- Hybrid period requires supporting both

### 6.4 Future: Data Availability Sampling

Full danksharding will introduce DAS, where nodes verify data availability through random sampling rather than downloading full data:

```
DAS Security: 
P(undetected unavailability) < (1 - sample_ratio)^num_samples

With sample_ratio = 0.5 and num_samples = 75:
P(undetected) < 0.5^75 ≈ 2.6 × 10^-23
```

**Implications for Fraud Proofs:**

1. **Integration with DAS proofs**: Fraud proofs may need to include DAS attestations
2. **Partial availability handling**: New failure modes if data partially available
3. **Fraud proofs for DA claims**: May need to prove DA committee misbehavior

---

## 7. Advanced Topics and Emerging Research

### 7.1 Hybrid Optimistic-ZK Systems

An emerging trend combines optimistic execution with optional validity proofs:

**Approach 1: ZK Fast Finality**
- Execute optimistically for immediate soft finality
- Generate ZK proof asynchronously
- ZK proof provides instant hard finality when ready

**Approach 2: ZK Fraud Proofs**
- Use ZK proofs as fraud proofs
- Reduces on-chain verification cost
- Enables single-round dispute resolution for complex computations

**Trade-off Analysis:**

| Metric | Pure Optimistic | ZK Fraud Proof | Full ZK |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Proof generation time | N/A | Minutes-hours | Minutes-hours |
| Proof generation cost | N/A | $0.01-0.10 | $0.01-0.10 |
| Verification cost | 3-15M gas (dispute) | ~300K gas | ~300K gas |
| Finality (no dispute) | 7 days | 7 days | Minutes |
| Finality (with ZK) | N/A | Minutes | Minutes |
| Implementation complexity | Medium | High | High |

**Crossover Analysis:**

When does ZK become preferable to fraud proofs?

```
Cost(fraud proof) = P(dispute) × Gas(dispute) × GasPrice
Cost(ZK proof) = Gas(verify) × GasPrice + ProofGeneration

Crossover when:
P(dispute) × Gas(dispute) > Gas(verify) + ProofGeneration/GasPrice

With current parameters:
P(dispute) × 10M > 300K + $0.05/$0.00005
P(dispute) > 0.03 + 0.1 = 0.13 = 13%
```

This suggests ZK proofs become economically preferable when dispute probability exceeds ~13%, which is far above observed rates. However, the finality benefits of ZK may justify the cost regardless.

**Example: Arbitrum's ZK Roadmap**
Arbitrum has announced plans to integrate ZK proofs:
```
Current: BOLD interactive fraud proofs
Near-term: Optional ZK proofs for faster finality  
Long-term: Full ZK validity proofs (Arbitrum Stylus enables this path)
```

### 7.2 Cross-Chain Fraud Proofs

As rollups proliferate, fraud proofs become relevant for cross-chain security:

**Scenario**: Bridge from Rollup A to Rollup B
- Rollup B accepts state claims from Rollup A
- Invalid claims could enable theft
- Fraud proofs can secure cross-rollup bridges

**Challenges**:
- Different VMs require different proof systems
- Latency compounds across chains
- Coordination between independent systems

**Solutions Under Development**:
- Standardized fraud proof interfaces
- Shared sequencer sets with unified dispute resolution
- ZK proofs of L2 state for instant cross-chain verification

### 7.3 Fraud Proofs for Non-EVM Chains

Fraud proof techniques extend beyond EVM:

**Sovereign Rollups**:
- Post data to DA layer (Celestia, Avail)
- Fraud proofs verified by rollup's own validator set
- No L1 settlement, pure DA usage

**Bitcoin Rollups**:
- BitVM enables fraud proofs on Bitcoin
- Extremely limited on-chain verification capability
- Requires novel cryptographic techniques (commitment schemes, Lamport signatures)

**Application-Specific Rollups**:
- Gaming, social, DeFi-specific rollups
- Custom VMs with tailored fraud proof systems
- Potential for more efficient proofs with restricted instruction sets

### 7.4 MEV and Fraud Proofs

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) intersects with fraud proofs in several ways:

**MEV in Dispute Resolution**:
- Validators may extract MEV from fraud proof transactions
- Could affect timing and ordering of disputes
- Potential for MEV-aware dispute strategies

**Fraud Proofs for MEV Protection**:
- Proving sequencer violated ordering rules
- Enforcing fair ordering through disputable claims
- MEV-Share and similar mechanisms

| L1 full node | 2TB SSD, 16GB RAM | $300/month |
| Monitoring | Alerting, dashboards | $100/month |
| Bond capital | 1-2 ETH | Opportunity cost |
| **Total** | | **~$900/month + capital** |

## 10. Conclusion

Fraud proof mechanisms represent a sophisticated solution to the challenge of scaling blockchain systems while maintaining trustless security. Through careful game-theoretic design, innovative bisection protocols, and robust implementation, optimistic rollups have demonstrated the viability of the "optimistic" paradigm for Layer 2 scaling.

Our analysis reveals several key findings:

1. **Interactive fraud proofs have proven superior** for general-purpose computation, enabling disputes over arbitrarily complex transactions with logarithmic on-chain costs. The detailed gas analysis shows ~10,000x improvement over non-interactive approaches for complex computations.

2. **The transition to permissionless proving is underway**, with Arbitrum's BOLD protocol achieving full permissionless validation and Optimism's Cannon system progressing toward similar decentralization. However, users should understand the different security properties of permissioned versus permissionless systems.

3. **Security depends on multiple factors** beyond the fraud proof mechanism itself. Our quantitative analysis reveals that bond amounts alone are insufficient for deterrence—the system relies critically on near-certain detection, reputational costs, and the practical difficulty of constructing undetectable invalid assertions.

4. **The 1-of-N honest assumption has significant practical requirements** including infrastructure costs ($2,000-5,000/month), capital requirements (1+ ETH), technical expertise, and economic rationality. Current verifier sets are more concentrated than the theoretical model suggests, introducing centralization risks that deserve ongoing attention.

5. **Hybrid ZK-optimistic systems represent the likely future**, combining the flexibility of optimistic execution with the finality benefits of validity proofs. Our crossover analysis suggests ZK becomes economically preferable when dispute probability exceeds ~13%, though finality benefits may justify adoption regardless.

6. **Standardization and interoperability** will become increasingly important as the rollup ecosystem matures and cross-chain interactions proliferate.

For researchers, the field offers rich opportunities in formal verification, game-theoretic analysis, economic security modeling, and cryptographic innovation. For practitioners, understanding fraud proof mechanisms—including their limitations and practical requirements—is essential for building secure applications and infrastructure on Layer 2 systems.

As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, fraud proofs will remain a fundamental building block—even as their role shifts from primary security mechanism to fallback and specialized applications. The innovations developed in this domain will have lasting impact on how we design and secure decentralized systems.

## Appendix C: Economic Security Calculations

### C.1 Attack Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Invalid State Transition Attack:**

```
Variables:
- TVL: Total Value Locked ($10B for Arbitrum)
- B: Bond amount (1 ETH ≈ $3,000)
- P_d: Detection probability (estimated 99.99%)
- R: Reputational/legal cost (unquantified but significant)

Expected Value of Attack:
EV = (1 - P_d) × TVL - P_d × (B + R)
EV = 0.0001 × $10B - 0.9999 × ($3K + R)
EV = $1M - $3K - R

For attack to be unprofitable:
R > $1M - $3K ≈ $997K

Conclusion: Reputational/legal costs must exceed ~$1M for deterrence
(This is easily satisfied for known sequencer operators)
```

### C.2 Verifier Economics

**Break-even Analysis for Independent Verifier:**

```
Monthly Costs:
- Infrastructure: $900
- Capital opportunity cost (2 ETH at 5% APY): $25
- Total: $925/month

Monthly Revenue:
- Successful challenges: P(fraud) × Reward
- With P(fraud) ≈ 0 currently: Revenue ≈ $0

Deficit: ~$925/month

Conclusion: Pure economic verification is not viable;
verifiers must have additional motivations (token holdings,
service bundling, altruism)
```

### C.3 Griefing Attack Economics

**Cost to Delay Withdrawals (BOLD):**

```
Target: Delay all withdrawals by 30 days

BOLD Properties:
- Maximum delay per challenge: ~7.4 days
- Challenges resolve in parallel
- Bond lost per failed challenge: 0.1 ETH

Strategy: Continuous invalid assertions
- Assertions needed: 30/7.4 ≈ 4 sequential periods
- But BOLD resolves in parallel, so: 1 period of challenges
- Cost: N × 0.1 ETH (where N = number of assertions)

For meaningful disruption (N = 100 assertions):
- Cost: 10 ETH ≈ $30,000
- Duration: 7.4 days maximum

Conclusion: BOLD makes sustained griefing expensive and bounded
```
