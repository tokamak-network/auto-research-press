## Author Response - Round 1

### Overview

We sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback on our manuscript. We appreciate the time and expertise they have dedicated to evaluating our work. The reviewers unanimously identified a critical deficiency that we acknowledge without reservation: the complete absence of a references section despite 60+ in-text citations. This was an unacceptable submission error on our part, and we apologize for this fundamental scholarly lapse. We have now prepared a complete bibliography with full citations, DOIs, and URLs for all referenced works, which will be included in the revised manuscript.

Beyond this critical issue, the reviewers provided valuable feedback across several themes: (1) the need for greater quantitative rigor and specific numerical examples, (2) deeper treatment of quantum mechanical foundations for detection mechanisms, (3) more critical synthesis rather than purely descriptive coverage, and (4) expansion of theoretical framework discussions beyond WIMPs. We have carefully considered all suggestions and will implement substantial revisions addressing these concerns. The revised manuscript will include quantitative comparison tables, enhanced discussion of quantum detection physics, expanded treatment of alternative dark matter candidates, and more critical analysis of current experimental results and their theoretical implications.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Particle Physics Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of our manuscript's organizational clarity and technical accuracy (scores of 9/10 and 8/10 respectively), while acknowledging the serious concerns about missing references and limited quantitative depth. The average score of 6.7/10 fairly reflects these deficiencies, and we are committed to addressing all identified issues.

**Major Points**:

1. **CRITICAL: Missing References Section**
   - **Our response**: We fully acknowledge this inexcusable error. This was a submission mistake where the references section was inadvertently omitted from the uploaded manuscript file. We deeply apologize for this fundamental scholarly failure, which rightfully raised concerns about citation validity.
   - **Action taken**: We have now compiled a complete references section with 63 entries, including full bibliographic information, DOIs where available, and URLs for preprint versions. All in-text citations have been verified against the actual publications. Key references include: Planck Collaboration (2020) for cosmological parameters, Aprile et al. (2023) for LZ results, Ackermann et al. (2017) for Galactic Center excess analysis, and numerous other primary experimental and theoretical papers. This will be included as a separate "References" section following the conclusion.

2. **Limited Discussion of Non-WIMP Theoretical Frameworks**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that while we mention axions and primordial black holes, the treatment is superficial compared to the extensive WIMP discussion. This imbalance does not reflect the current diversity of viable dark matter candidates.
   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 2 to include a new subsection (2.4) titled "Alternative Dark Matter Candidates" covering: (a) axion physics with explicit discussion of axion-photon coupling g_aγγ ~ (α/2πf_a)(E/N - 1.92), the QCD axion parameter space, and the relationship between axion mass and decay constant; (b) sterile neutrino production mechanisms including Dodelson-Widrow and Shi-Fuller scenarios, with typical mixing angles |U_e4|² ~ 10^-10 to 10^-7; (c) primordial black hole formation from inflationary perturbations and their mass constraints from microlensing (MACHO/EROS), CMB distortions, and gravitational wave observations. This addition (~800 words) will provide the theoretical depth the reviewer requests.

3. **Insufficient Quantitative Discussion of Experimental Parameters**
   - **Our response**: We agree that specific numerical examples would strengthen technical rigor and make experimental comparisons more concrete. The current manuscript states results without providing context on exposure times, event rates, or background levels.
   - **Action taken**: We will add two comprehensive tables: **Table 1** comparing major direct detection experiments (LZ, XENONnT, PandaX-4T, CDMS, CRESST) with columns for target mass, exposure time, energy threshold, background rate (events/keV/kg/day), and current sensitivity limits across the 1-1000 GeV mass range; **Table 2** showing projected future reach for next-generation experiments (DARWIN, Argo, SuperCDMS SNOLAB) with anticipated commissioning dates and sensitivity improvements. We will also add specific quantitative examples in the text, such as: "LZ's 5.5 tonne fiducial mass accumulated 60 live-days in the first science run, yielding 220 tonne-days exposure with a background rate of <0.1 events/keV/tonne/year in the WIMP search region."

4. **Thermal Relic Cross-Section Calculation Lacks Rigor**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that we state ⟨σv⟩ ≈ 3 × 10^-26 cm³/s without deriving it from freeze-out dynamics. This is indeed insufficient for a technical review article.
   - **Action taken**: We will expand the discussion in Section 2.2 to include: (a) the Boltzmann equation governing WIMP freeze-out: dn/dt + 3Hn = -⟨σv⟩(n² - n_eq²); (b) the freeze-out condition when Γ_ann = ⟨σv⟩n_eq ~ H, occurring at T_f ≈ m_χ/20; (c) derivation showing that the relic abundance Ω_χh² ≈ 0.1 requires ⟨σv⟩ ≈ 3 × 10^-26 cm³/s for s-wave annihilation; (d) brief discussion of velocity-dependent terms (p-wave contributions) and their impact on indirect detection signatures. This will occupy approximately 300 additional words with one supporting equation display.

5. **Nuclear Form Factor Treatment Needs Quantification**
   - **Our response**: We agree that mentioning form factors without explicit calculation leaves the discussion incomplete, particularly given their significant impact on sensitivity at higher WIMP masses.
   - **Action taken**: We will add explicit treatment of the Helm form factor: F(q) = [3j₁(qr_n)/(qr_n)]² exp(-(qs)²), where j₁ is the spherical Bessel function, r_n is the nuclear radius, and s is the nuclear skin thickness. For xenon-131 with r_n ≈ 5.5 fm, we will show quantitatively that F(q) drops to ~0.5 at q ≈ 50 MeV (corresponding to ~100 GeV WIMP mass), explaining why sensitivity degrades at high masses. This will include a new figure (Figure 4) showing F(q²) versus recoil energy for representative nuclei (Xe, Ge, Ar).

6. **Treatment of Statistical Methods Needs Expansion**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that our discussion of limit-setting methodology is too cursory for a technical audience. Profile likelihood construction and systematic uncertainty treatment are crucial for interpreting experimental results.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (3.1.6) titled "Statistical Methodology" covering: (a) profile likelihood ratio construction: λ(σ_χN) = L(σ_χN, ˆˆθ)/L(ˆσ_χN, ˆθ), where θ represents nuisance parameters; (b) treatment of systematic uncertainties through nuisance parameters with constraint terms; (c) modified frequentist CLs method used by most collaborations; (d) global fit approaches combining multiple experiments with correlated systematics. This addition (~500 words) will provide the methodological depth expected in a review article.

**Minor Points**:

We will address the following additional suggestions:
- Add critical assessment distinguishing model-dependent versus model-independent interpretations of indirect detection anomalies, particularly emphasizing that Galactic Center excess interpretation depends strongly on assumed halo profiles and background modeling
- Include discussion of null result interpretation frameworks, specifically how combined analyses across experiments constrain model parameter space more effectively than individual experiments
- Expand treatment of collider constraints with explicit comparison of momentum transfer scales (√s ~ TeV) versus typical mediator masses in simplified models, justifying when collider searches provide complementary versus redundant information relative to direct detection
- Add quantitative impact calculation showing how 30-50% uncertainty in local dark matter density (ρ₀ = 0.3-0.4 GeV/cm³) translates to corresponding uncertainty in cross-section limits, since σ_χN ∝ 1/ρ₀

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Quantum Physics Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of our organizational structure and clarity (8/10), while taking seriously the concerns about quantum mechanical rigor and the critical missing references. The low average score of 4.8/10 appropriately reflects these fundamental deficiencies. We are committed to substantially strengthening the quantum physics foundations throughout the manuscript.

**Major Points**:

1. **CRITICAL: Missing References Section**
   - **Our response**: As stated in our response to Reviewer 1, we sincerely apologize for this unacceptable submission error. The references section was inadvertently omitted from the uploaded file.
   - **Action taken**: Complete references section with 63 entries now prepared, including all DOIs and URLs. This will be included in the revised manuscript. We understand this was the reviewer's primary concern and it has been fully addressed.

2. **CEνNS Treatment Lacks Quantum Mechanical Rigor**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer makes an excellent point that we failed to explain the quantum mechanical basis for coherence in CEνNS. Simply stating it is "coherent" without explaining why is pedagogically insufficient.
   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand the CEνNS discussion in Section 3.1.4 to include: (a) explicit explanation that coherence occurs when momentum transfer q << 1/R_nucleus (typically q < 50 MeV for solar neutrinos), allowing the neutrino wavepacket to overlap the entire nucleus; (b) quantum mechanical derivation showing that scattering amplitudes from individual nucleons add coherently: A_total = Σᵢ Aᵢ exp(iq·rᵢ) ≈ N·A for q → 0, yielding cross-section σ ∝ |A_total|² ∝ N²; (c) explicit formula: dσ/dE_R = (G_F²/4π) N² M_nucleus [1 - M_nucleus E_R/(2E_ν²)] F²(q²), where F(q²) is the nuclear form factor; (d) numerical example showing that for a 10 MeV solar neutrino scattering on xenon-131, the coherent enhancement factor N² ≈ 77² ≈ 6000 compared to single-nucleon scattering. This expansion (~400 words) will provide the quantum mechanical foundation the reviewer requests.

3. **Quenching Factor Discussion Lacks Quantum Process Understanding**
   - **Our response**: We agree that our phenomenological treatment of quenching factors omits the underlying quantum energy loss mechanisms. This is a significant gap given the importance of quenching for interpreting direct detection results.
   - **Action taken**: We will add detailed discussion of quantum mechanical quenching mechanisms in Section 3.1.2, including: (a) Lindhard theory describing the partition of recoil energy between electronic stopping (ionization/scintillation) and nuclear stopping (phonons), with the Lindhard factor L(E) = k g(ε)/(1 + k g(ε)) where ε = 11.5 E Z^(-7/3) is the reduced energy and g(ε) = 3ε^0.15 + 0.7ε^0.6 + ε; (b) quantum mechanical basis: electronic stopping dominates at high velocities (v > v_Bohr Z^2/3) where the recoil can ionize atoms, while nuclear stopping dominates at low velocities where energy transfer occurs through elastic collisions creating phonons; (c) explanation that measured quenching factors Q = (light yield for nuclear recoil)/(light yield for electron recoil at same energy) typically range from 0.1-0.3 depending on target and energy; (d) discussion of energy-dependent quenching and its impact on threshold determination. This will include a new figure showing measured quenching factors versus energy for representative targets.

4. **Sub-GeV Detection Physics Needs Rigorous Quantum Treatment**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that our discussion of emerging sub-GeV technologies mentions quantum detection mechanisms without explaining their quantum mechanical foundations. This is particularly important for Skipper CCDs and similar devices operating at fundamental quantum limits.
   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand Section 4.1 to include: (a) quantum mechanical basis of Skipper CCD operation: charge measurement through capacitive coupling allows non-destructive readout, with measurement noise σ_q = q_noise/√N where N is the number of measurements, approaching the fundamental quantum limit set by the uncertainty principle; (b) explicit discussion of single-electron sensitivity: with typical q_noise ~ 0.1 e⁻ per measurement, N ~ 100 measurements yield σ_q ~ 0.01 e⁻, enabling reliable single-electron counting; (c) quantum detection mechanisms for meV-scale depositions: phonon excitations in crystals (quantum harmonic oscillator states), roton production in superfluid helium (collective quantum excitations), and Cooper pair breaking in superconductors (BCS theory predicts gap energy Δ ~ 1 meV); (d) discussion of quantum decoherence timescales and their impact on detector response. This expansion (~600 words) will provide the rigorous quantum foundation the reviewer expects.

5. **Directional Detection Quantum Mechanical Basis Not Explained**
   - **Our response**: We agree that stating directional anisotropy without explaining the quantum mechanical basis for track reconstruction is insufficient.
   - **Action taken**: We will add explicit quantum mechanical discussion in Section 3.2, including: (a) explanation that ionization track preserves directional information because the initial nuclear recoil momentum p determines the spatial distribution of ionization electrons through Coulomb interactions; (b) quantum mechanical diffusion: the track spreads via electron-atom scattering described by the diffusion equation, with diffusion coefficient D related to scattering cross-section σ through D = (1/3)v_th λ where λ = 1/(nσ) is the mean free path; (c) discussion of how gas choice (typically CF₄ or CS₂) optimizes the trade-off between track length (requiring low pressure for long recoil ranges) and diffusion (requiring high pressure to minimize spreading); (d) quantum mechanical basis for head-tail discrimination using ionization density differences along the track. This will occupy approximately 350 additional words.

6. **Nuclear Form Factors as Fourier Transforms Not Explained**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer is absolutely correct that form factors should be introduced as the quantum mechanical Fourier transform of nuclear density distributions, not merely as phenomenological functions.
   - **Action taken**: We will add fundamental quantum mechanical explanation in Section 3.1.1: (a) define form factor as F(q) = |∫ ρ(r) exp(iq·r) d³r|² where ρ(r) is the nuclear density distribution normalized to ∫ ρ(r) d³r = 1; (b) explain physical interpretation: F(q) measures how nuclear structure affects scattering at momentum transfer q, with F(0) = 1 (point-like limit) and F(q) → 0 for q >> 1/R_nucleus (resolved structure); (c) derive Helm form factor from Woods-Saxon nuclear density distribution ρ(r) = ρ₀/(1 + exp[(r-R)/a]) where R is the nuclear radius and a is the skin thickness; (d) show explicitly that F(q) = [3j₁(qr_n)/(qr_n)]² exp(-(qs)²) emerges from this Fourier transform with appropriate approximations. This will provide the quantum mechanical foundation the reviewer requests.

7. **Missing Discussion of Quantum Coherence Effects**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer makes an excellent point that quantum coherence effects are crucial for sub-GeV detection and represent fundamentally quantum mechanical channels without classical analogs.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (4.1.3) titled "Quantum Coherence and Collective Excitations" covering: (a) phonon excitations in crystals as quantized lattice vibrations (quantum harmonic oscillators) with energies E_n = ℏω(n + 1/2), showing that dark matter with kinetic energy E_χ ~ meV can excite single phonons; (b) roton production in superfluid helium: dark matter scattering can create rotons (collective excitations with characteristic dispersion relation E(p) = Δ + (p - p₀)²/2
