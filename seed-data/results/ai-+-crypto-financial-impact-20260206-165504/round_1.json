      "summary": "This manuscript provides a broad survey of AI applications in cryptocurrency markets with reasonable coverage of trading systems, DeFi integration, and emerging tokenized AI services.

      "suggestions": [
        "Provide detailed methodology sections for all quantitative claims, including data sources, sample periods, statistical tests, and confidence intervals; the 65-70% directional accuracy claim for LSTM models needs proper benchmark comparisons against naive forecasts and transaction-cost-adjusted returns",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a machine learning in quantitative finance perspective, this manuscript exhibits several concerning gaps. The discussion of deep learning models for price forecasting glosses over fundamental challenges: cryptocurrency markets exhibit regime changes, fat-tailed distributions, and low signal-to-noise ratios that make standard accuracy metrics misleading. Claiming 65-70% directional accuracy without discussing the economic significance (Sharpe ratios, maximum drawdown, transaction costs) is a common pitfall in this literature. The DRL portfolio management discussion citing 40-60% Sharpe ratio improvements is extraordinary and requires scrutiny\u2014such claims typically do not survive proper out-of-sample testing with realistic market impact models. The NLP sentiment analysis section mentions social media analysis but provides no discussion of the well-documented challenges: survivorship bias in crypto social data, bot activity contamination, and the rapid decay of sentiment signals. The treatment of transformer architectures for time-series prediction is particularly thin\u2014there's no mention of the ongoing debate about whether transformers actually outperform simpler models for financial time series when properly regularized. The market microstructure analysis is more grounded, but the causal attribution of spread compression to AI trading (rather than general market maturation, increased competition, or regulatory changes) requires more careful identification strategy. I would recommend the authors engage more deeply with the academic literature on limits to arbitrage, market efficiency tests specific to crypto, and the substantial body of work on why ML models often fail in live trading despite strong backtests.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a financial technology regulation and systemic risk perspective, this manuscript has significant gaps that undermine its utility for policymakers and risk managers. The claim that AI trading accounts for 60-80% of spot volume is presented without primary source citation and has major regulatory implications that go unexplored\u2014specifically, how do exchanges and regulators monitor for market manipulation when the vast majority of activity is algorithmic? The paper mentions the Mango Markets exploit but fails to connect this to broader regulatory responses or the need for enhanced oracle governance frameworks. The systemic risk section identifies important concerns but provides no analytical framework for quantifying these risks. For instance, the paper should address: What is the correlation structure of AI trading strategies during stress events? How do liquidation cascades propagate across protocols sharing common collateral assets? What circuit breaker mechanisms exist, and are they calibrated for AI trading speeds? The complete absence of AML/fraud detection discussion is a critical oversight\u2014AI is transforming both the commission of financial crimes in crypto (through sophisticated mixing, layering, and evasion techniques) and their detection (through graph analytics, behavioral analysis, and real-time monitoring). Any comprehensive assessment of AI's financial impact must address this dual-use nature. Finally, the regulatory projections are vague; the paper should engage with specific regulatory proposals and their likely market impacts, including the extraterritorial reach of EU regulations and the ongoing SEC enforcement actions against crypto platforms.",

The market microstructure section correctly identifies key phenomena (spread compression, increased quote velocity, reduced arbitrage windows) but the analysis remains superficial. For instance, the GARCH volatility clustering metric (\u03b1+\u03b2 declining from 0.94 to 0.89) is presented without model specification, estimation methodology, or discussion of whether this represents improved market efficiency or simply different volatility regimes. The DeFi analysis conflates correlation with causation throughout\u2014the claim that AI-managed positions achieve 15-40% IL reduction requires careful counterfactual construction and acknowledgment that active management strategies may simply be selecting favorable market conditions. The discussion of AMM fee optimization lacks engagement with the substantial academic literature on optimal market maker fee structures (e.g., Lehar & Parlour 2021 on Uniswap). The oracle manipulation section correctly identifies risks but doesn't engage with the mechanism design literature on manipulation-resistant price feeds. Most concerning, several citations appear to be hallucinated or misattributed\u2014the Cong et al. NBER paper cited discusses different topics than claimed, and the Bianchi et al. JFE paper cannot be verified. The projections in Section 6.2 (55-95% CAGR for AI-crypto tokens) lack any modeling foundation and appear speculative. For this work to meet publication standards, it requires: (1) transparent data sources and replicable methodology, (2) proper statistical inference rather than point estimates, (3) verified citations, and (4) deeper engagement with the existing academic literature on cryptocurrency market microstructure and DeFi mechanism design.",

The reviewers consistently acknowledge the paper's clear organizational structure, broad scope, and useful quantitative presentation of market metrics. However, all three reviewers converge on several serious concerns that cannot be dismissed as overly harsh calibration.\n\nThe most critical issue\u2014flagged independently by Reviewers 1 and 3\u2014is that several cited references appear to be fabricated or misattributed. This is not a minor presentation issue but a fundamental credibility problem that must be resolved before any publication decision. Additionally, the reviewers raise legitimate methodological concerns: key quantitative claims (60-80% AI trading volume, 15-40% impermanent loss reduction, 65-70% directional accuracy) are presented without adequate sourcing, methodology, or statistical rigor. These aren't demands for theoretical novelty inappropriate to an industry survey; they're basic standards of empirical substantiation that any research publication requires.\n\nReviewer 2's concerns about missing regulatory and systemic risk analysis are substantive but represent scope expansion rather than fundamental flaws\u2014these could be addressed through either additional sections or explicit scope limitations. The reviewers are applying reasonable standards for a research publication; the criticisms are substantive rather than nitpicking. Given this is Round 1 of 3, there is adequate runway for the authors to address these issues, but the citation verification and methodological transparency problems require substantial work that goes beyond minor revision.",

  "author_rebuttal": "## Author Rebuttal - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive evaluation of our manuscript on AI applications in cryptocurrency markets. The reviews have identified several critical issues that we take very seriously, and we are committed to substantially revising the manuscript to address these concerns.\n\nThree major themes emerge across all reviews that we must confront directly: (1) **citation integrity concerns**\u2014multiple reviewers have flagged potentially fabricated or misattributed references, which we acknowledge as a serious issue requiring immediate correction; (2) **insufficient methodological rigor**\u2014our quantitative claims lack adequate sourcing, statistical substantiation, and uncertainty quantification; and (3) **gaps in coverage**\u2014particularly regarding regulatory frameworks, AML/compliance implications, and deeper engagement with academic literature. We accept these criticisms as valid and outline below our comprehensive revision strategy to address each concern. We believe the revised manuscript will meet the standards expected for publication-quality research.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Machine Learning in Quantitative Finance)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 1 for the balanced evaluation (6.2/10 average) and particularly appreciate the recognition of our comprehensive scope and balanced treatment of risks. The criticisms regarding technical depth and methodological rigor are well-founded, and we commit to substantial improvements.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Unsourced quantitative claims (60-80% AI trading volume, 15-40% IL reduction)**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this is a significant weakness. The 60-80% figure was based on informal industry estimates and exchange operator interviews rather than rigorous methodology. We should not have presented this as established fact without proper sourcing.\n   - **Action taken**: We will (a) remove unsourced point estimates or clearly label them as industry estimates with appropriate caveats; (b) replace with verifiable data from academic sources or clearly attributed industry reports (e.g., Chainalysis, Kaiko research); (c) for the IL reduction claims, we will either obtain primary data from the protocols cited (Arrakis, Gamma Strategies publish some performance metrics) with full methodology disclosure, or reframe these as protocol-reported figures with explicit survivorship bias and selection bias caveats.\n\n2. **Superficial ML technical depth (DRL, LSTM-attention, transformers)**\n   - **Our response**: We agree the manuscript reads more as a survey than a technical analysis. The reviewer correctly identifies that we failed to address hyperparameter sensitivity, overfitting, transaction costs, and out-of-sample validation\u2014all critical issues in applied ML for finance.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated subsection on \"Methodological Challenges in ML for Crypto Markets\" addressing: (a) non-stationarity and regime changes; (b) the gap between backtest accuracy and live trading performance; (c) transaction cost modeling and market impact; (d) the ongoing debate on transformer vs. simpler model performance for financial time series (citing Zeng et al. 2023 on DLinear, among others); (e) proper walk-forward validation schemes. We will also add benchmark comparisons for the 65-70% directional accuracy claim against naive forecasts and random walk baselines.\n\n3. **Fabricated or misattributed citations (Bianchi et al. 2023, Jiang et al. 2022)**\n   - **Our response**: We take this criticism with utmost seriousness. Upon re-verification, we confirm that several citations in our manuscript cannot be verified as stated. This is unacceptable and we apologize to the reviewers for this lapse in scholarly standards.\n   - **Action taken**: We will conduct a complete citation audit, removing or correcting all unverifiable references. Specifically: (a) the Bianchi et al. 2023 \"forthcoming JFE\" reference will be removed and replaced with verifiable published work; (b) the Jiang et al. 2022 citation will be corrected or removed; (c) we will clearly distinguish between peer-reviewed publications, working papers, industry reports, and protocol documentation throughout. We will provide DOIs or URLs for all citations where available.\n\n4. **Extraordinary claims require scrutiny (40-60% Sharpe ratio improvements)**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that such claims rarely survive proper out-of-sample testing with realistic assumptions. We presented these figures without adequate skepticism.\n   - **Action taken**: We will reframe this discussion to acknowledge that reported performance improvements in DRL portfolio management typically (a) come from backtests without realistic transaction costs and slippage; (b) suffer from look-ahead bias and data snooping; (c) often fail to replicate in live trading. We will cite the academic literature on the \"backtest overfitting\" problem (Bailey et al. 2014, 2017) and present these figures as \"reported in literature\" rather than established facts.\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We will add discussion of NLP challenges including bot contamination and signal decay\n- We will address the causal identification problem for spread compression (market maturation vs. AI trading)\n- We will engage more deeply with limits-to-arbitrage literature and crypto-specific market efficiency tests\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Financial Technology Regulation and Systemic Risk)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 2 for the detailed critique (5.4/10 average). The low rigor score (4/10) reflects legitimate concerns about our treatment of regulatory and systemic risk issues, which we acknowledge were underweighted relative to their importance.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Critical omission of AML/KYC implications**\n   - **Our response**: We agree this is a significant gap. AI's role in both enabling and detecting financial crimes in crypto is central to understanding its financial impact, and our omission of this topic was a meaningful oversight.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section (approximately 800-1000 words) on \"AI in Crypto Compliance and Financial Crime\" covering: (a) AI-powered transaction monitoring and suspicious activity detection; (b) wallet clustering and graph analytics for sanctions screening; (c) FATF guidance on virtual assets and Travel Rule compliance challenges; (d) the dual-use nature of AI (evasion vs. detection); (e) regulatory expectations from FinCEN and international bodies. We will cite relevant academic work (e.g., Foley et al. 2019 on illicit activity in Bitcoin) and regulatory guidance documents.\n\n2. **Systemic risk assessment lacks quantitative rigor**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we discuss systemic risks qualitatively without providing analytical frameworks for quantification. This limits the paper's utility for policymakers and risk managers.\n   - **Action taken**: We will develop a more rigorous systemic risk framework including: (a) discussion of contagion modeling approaches applicable to DeFi (network analysis, correlation structures during stress); (b) specific analysis of liquidation cascade mechanics with reference to documented events (Terra/Luna, the March 2020 \"Black Thursday\" on MakerDAO); (c) discussion of circuit breaker mechanisms and their calibration for algorithmic trading speeds; (d) analysis of correlation structure of AI trading strategies during stress events (to the extent data is available). We acknowledge that comprehensive quantitative modeling may be beyond the scope of a survey paper, but we will provide a clearer analytical framework and identify data requirements for future research.\n\n3. **Superficial and backward-looking regulatory analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. Our regulatory discussion failed to engage substantively with current regulatory developments.\n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand the regulatory section to address: (a) MiCA implementation timeline and specific provisions affecting AI-crypto applications; (b) EU AI Act high-risk classification for financial AI systems and compliance requirements; (c) SEC enforcement trends and their implications for AI-managed funds; (d) the accountability gap for AI-caused market manipulation or consumer harm; (e) cross-border regulatory arbitrage risks. We will engage with specific regulatory texts rather than general characterizations.\n\n4. **Mango Markets exploit disconnected from regulatory response**\n   - **Our response**: We mentioned this case study but failed to connect it to broader implications.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand this discussion to include: (a) the subsequent legal proceedings and their precedential value; (b) implications for oracle governance frameworks; (c) regulatory responses and guidance that emerged from this and similar incidents.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- We will address how exchanges monitor for manipulation in predominantly algorithmic markets\n- We will discuss the extraterritorial reach of EU regulations\n- We will clarify the regulatory status of autonomous AI agents in financial services\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Cryptocurrency Economics and Market Microstructure)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 3 for the thorough evaluation (6.2/10 average). The concerns raised substantially overlap with Reviewers 1 and 2, reinforcing that these are genuine weaknesses requiring attention.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **AI trading volume methodology absent**\n   - **Our response**: As noted in our response to Reviewer 1, we acknowledge this claim lacks proper methodological foundation.\n   - **Action taken**: We will either (a) provide a clear methodology for estimating AI-driven trading volume (distinguishing from simpler algorithmic strategies based on observable characteristics like order patterns, latency profiles, etc.) with appropriate uncertainty bounds, or (b) reframe this as an industry estimate with explicit caveats about measurement challenges. We will discuss the inherent difficulty in distinguishing AI-driven from rule-based algorithmic trading.\n\n2. **GARCH analysis lacks specification and methodology**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that we presented GARCH results (\u03b1+\u03b2 declining from 0.94 to 0.89) without model specification or estimation details.\n   - **Action taken**: We will either (a) provide full model specification, data sources, estimation methodology, and statistical tests, or (b) remove this claim if we cannot adequately substantiate it. We will also address whether observed changes represent improved efficiency or different volatility regimes, as the reviewer suggests.\n\n3. **DeFi analysis conflates correlation with causation**\n   - **Our response**: This is a fair criticism. We attributed efficiency gains to AI management without adequate counterfactual analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: We will reframe causal claims as correlational observations, explicitly acknowledging that: (a) AI-managed strategies may select favorable market conditions; (b) survivorship bias affects protocol-level performance data; (c) proper causal inference would require controlled experiments or careful identification strategies that are generally unavailable. We will engage with the academic literature on AMM mechanism design (including Lehar & Parlour 2021 as suggested).\n\n4. **Citation verification failures**\n   - **Our response**: As noted above, we take this extremely seriously and will conduct a complete audit.\n   - **Action taken**: We will verify every citation, correct misattributions, remove unverifiable references, and ensure the Cong et al. NBER paper (and all others) accurately reflects the content cited. We will provide DOIs and access dates for all references.\n\n5. **Speculative projections (55-95% CAGR) lack modeling foundation**\n   - **Our response**: We agree these projections appear speculative without underlying methodology.\n   - **Action taken**: We will either (a) provide explicit modeling assumptions and methodology for growth projections with sensitivity analysis, or (b) remove specific numerical projections and instead discuss qualitative factors that will influence market development, clearly labeled as forward-looking speculation rather than analysis.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- We will engage with mechanism design literature on manipulation-resistant price feeds\n- We will provide exchange-specific data access methodology where applicable\n- We will include confidence intervals and robustness checks for quantitative claims\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Revisions Planned:**\n\n1. **Complete citation audit**: Verify all references, remove/correct fabricated or misattributed citations, add DOIs, clearly distinguish peer-reviewed from other sources\n\n2. **New section on AML/compliance**: ~800-1000 words covering AI in financial crime detection and regulatory compliance expectations\n\n3. **Expanded regulatory analysis**: Substantive engagement with MiCA, EU AI Act, SEC enforcement, FATF guidance, and accountability frameworks\n\n4. **Enhanced systemic risk framework**: Contagion modeling discussion, liquidation cascade analysis, circuit breaker mechanisms, with reference to documented events\n\n5. **New ML methodology subsection**: Address non-stationarity, backtest vs. live performance gap, transaction cost modeling, and model validation challenges\n\n6. **Quantitative claims revision**: Add uncertainty quantification, statistical tests, and confidence intervals; remove or caveat unsourced estimates; provide benchmark comparisons\n\n**Clarifications Added:**\n- Distinguish AI-driven from rule-based algorithmic trading\n- Acknowledge causal inference limitations in DeFi efficiency claims\n- Discuss survivorship bias in protocol performance data\n- Address correlation vs. causation throughout\n\n**New Analysis/Data:**\n- Benchmark comparisons for ML accuracy claims\n- Engagement with academic literature on AMM mechanism design, limits to arbitrage, and market microstructure\n- Specific regulatory text analysis rather than general characterizations\n\nWe estimate these revisions will add approximately 2,500-3,000 words to the manuscript while also streamlining some existing sections. We are committed to producing a revised manuscript that meets the rigorous standards expected by all three reviewers and welcome any additional guidance on priorities for revision.",
