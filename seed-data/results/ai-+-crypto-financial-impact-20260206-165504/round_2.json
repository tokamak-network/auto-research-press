      "detailed_feedback": "The authors have made commendable progress in addressing my Round 1 concerns. The citation audit appears thorough\u2014the problematic Bianchi et al. and Jiang et al. references have been removed, and the remaining citations (Makarov & Schoar 2020, Fischer & Krauss 2018, Qin et al. 2021) are legitimate, verifiable publications. The new Section 2.1 subsection on 'Technical Considerations and Challenges' directly addresses my concerns about non-stationarity, overfitting, and transaction cost modeling, which significantly improves the manuscript's credibility for an ML audience. However, I note that while these challenges are now acknowledged, the treatment remains at a conceptual level. For a paper claiming to analyze AI's financial impact, I would expect at least one concrete quantitative example demonstrating these issues\u2014for instance, showing how a model's apparent 70% directional accuracy translates to negative returns after realistic transaction costs, or how performance degrades across different volatility regimes. The Sharpe ratio improvement claims (40-60%) from Round 1 have been appropriately reframed with skepticism about backtest validity, which is a significant improvement. The new Table in Section 2.3 with source attributions is helpful, though I note the GARCH analysis mentioned in Reviewer 3's concerns appears to have been removed entirely rather than substantiated\u2014this is an acceptable solution but represents a loss of potentially interesting content. The scenario-based projections in Section 7.2 are a much more appropriate approach than the previous point estimates. Overall, this revision moves the manuscript from 'adequate with significant issues' to 'strong with minor improvements needed' from an ML perspective.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptocurrency economics and market microstructure perspective, this revision represents meaningful progress. The authors have genuinely engaged with the feedback, and the manuscript now reads as a more honest assessment of what we know and don't know about AI's impact on crypto markets. The treatment of market microstructure improvements (Section 2.2-2.3) is now appropriately nuanced, correctly noting that spread compression and efficiency gains coincide with but cannot be causally attributed solely to AI trading. The engagement with Makarov & Schoar (2020) is appropriate and well-integrated. The new AML section addresses a critical gap and demonstrates understanding of the regulatory landscape. However, I remain concerned about the quantitative claims in the DeFi section. While the authors have added important caveats about survivorship bias and market condition sensitivity, the fundamental issue remains: we don't have rigorous, peer-reviewed empirical evidence for the claimed efficiency gains from AI-managed positions. The Lehar & Parlour (2021) citation is appropriate for theoretical foundations but doesn't validate the specific performance claims. For publication-quality work, I would expect either (1) original empirical analysis with proper statistical methodology, or (2) explicit acknowledgment that these figures come from protocol marketing materials and should be treated as unverified claims. The authors have chosen a middle path that is acceptable but not fully satisfying. The systemic risk discussion is improved but could benefit from more formal modeling frameworks\u2014even a simple network diagram showing protocol interdependencies would help readers understand contagion pathways. Overall, this is now a solid survey paper with appropriate caveats, though it falls short of making novel empirical contributions to the literature.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "The revision demonstrates that the authors took Round 1 feedback seriously, and the manuscript is meaningfully improved from a regulatory and systemic risk perspective. The new Section 6 on regulatory compliance addresses what was a glaring omission\u2014the AML/compliance dimension is now present and covers the key topics I identified. The discussion of Chainalysis, Elliptic, and TRM Labs as compliance infrastructure providers is appropriate, and the acknowledgment of DeFi's fundamental compliance challenges (who is responsible when there's no identifiable operator?) shows sophisticated understanding of the problem space.\n\nHowever, the systemic risk treatment, while improved, still lacks the quantitative rigor needed for practical application. The contagion pathway framework is conceptually sound, but without calibrated parameters or stress testing methodology, it remains a taxonomy rather than an analytical tool. The authors acknowledged in their rebuttal that 'comprehensive quantitative modeling may be beyond the scope of a survey paper,' but even a simplified worked example would substantially strengthen this section. The Terra/Luna and MakerDAO Black Thursday references are appropriate but descriptive rather than analytical.\n\nOn regulatory frameworks, the engagement with MiCA and EU AI Act is welcome but remains at a high level. For instance, the EU AI Act's high-risk classification for financial AI systems triggers specific compliance obligations (conformity assessments, CE marking, post-market monitoring) that would materially affect AI-crypto business models\u2014this deserves more than a sentence. Similarly, the accountability gap discussion identifies the problem but doesn't engage with the substantial legal scholarship on algorithmic accountability or emerging regulatory proposals.\n\nThe AML section would benefit from more specificity on regulatory expectations. FinCEN's 2019 guidance on convertible virtual currencies established that certain DeFi activities may trigger money transmitter obligations\u2014how does AI integration affect this analysis? The Travel Rule implementation for AI agents that may operate autonomously raises novel questions about beneficial ownership identification that deserve exploration.\n\nOverall, this revision moves the manuscript from inadequate (5.4/10 average in Round 1) to adequate-to-good territory. With further development of the quantitative systemic risk framework and deeper regulatory analysis, this could reach publication quality for a venue focused on the intersection of technology and financial regulation.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript has demonstrated substantial and genuine improvement from Round 1 (5.9) to Round 2 (7.1), representing a +1.2 point gain that reflects meaningful engagement with reviewer feedback. The authors have addressed the most serious concerns from the initial submission: fabricated citations have been removed and replaced with verifiable sources, methodological transparency has been significantly enhanced with appropriate caveats and uncertainty acknowledgments, and a substantive new section on regulatory compliance/AML has been added to address a critical gap. All three reviewers acknowledge these improvements explicitly, which indicates the authors are responsive and capable of producing quality work.\n\nThe remaining weaknesses identified by reviewers fall into two categories: (1) requests for deeper technical/quantitative rigor (stress testing models, formal statistical validation, benchmark comparisons) and (2) expanded regulatory analysis (FinCEN guidance, Travel Rule specifics, EU AI Act Article-level requirements). Critically, I assess these as enhancements that would strengthen an already solid contribution rather than fatal flaws that undermine the manuscript's core value. The reviewers are calibrated appropriately for a research publication, but some requests\u2014particularly for original empirical analysis like event studies or difference-in-differences designs\u2014exceed what is reasonable for what appears to be a comprehensive review/analysis piece rather than an original empirical study. The manuscript's contribution lies in synthesizing AI-crypto market developments, identifying systemic risk pathways, and mapping regulatory considerations\u2014not in generating novel econometric findings.\n\nGiven the strong improvement trajectory, the substantive nature of the contribution for practitioners and researchers seeking to understand this rapidly evolving space, and the fact that remaining issues are addressable through targeted additions rather than fundamental restructuring, I recommend minor revision.

  "author_rebuttal": "## Author Rebuttal - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript and their thoughtful, constructive feedback. The improvement in scores from Round 1 (average 5.4/10) to Round 2 (average 7.1/10) reflects the substantial revisions we undertook, and we are encouraged that reviewers found our responses to citation integrity, methodological transparency, and regulatory coverage to be meaningful improvements.\n\nThe Round 2 feedback coalesces around three primary themes: (1) the need for concrete quantitative examples and worked case studies rather than conceptual discussion alone, (2) requests for more specific source attribution for industry estimates and explicit benchmark comparisons, and (3) deeper engagement with regulatory specifics, particularly regarding the EU AI Act, FinCEN guidance, and quantitative stress testing methodologies. We appreciate that reviewers have distinguished between what constitutes appropriate scope for a survey paper versus original empirical research, while still pushing us toward greater rigor. In this rebuttal, we outline specific revisions that address these concerns while maintaining the manuscript's character as a comprehensive survey with analytical depth.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Machine Learning in Quantitative Finance)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 1 for recognizing the substantial improvements in citation integrity, methodological transparency, and appropriate hedging of quantitative claims. The improved scores (7-8 across categories) and characterization of the manuscript as moving from \"adequate with significant issues\" to \"strong with minor improvements needed\" is encouraging. We take seriously the remaining concerns about ML technical depth and the need for concrete worked examples.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **ML technical depth remains superficial; lacks concrete discussion of model architectures, hyperparameter sensitivity, or walk-forward validation implementations**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this limitation and agree that a concrete worked example would substantially strengthen the technical contribution. While comprehensive empirical analysis across multiple assets and timeframes exceeds survey scope, we can provide a focused case study demonstrating proper validation methodology.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (Section 2.4: \"Validation Case Study: BTC-USD Directional Prediction\") presenting a worked example using publicly available data. This will include: (a) walk-forward validation with 6-month training windows and 1-month test periods over 2019-2023; (b) comparison of LSTM directional accuracy against naive forecasts (random walk, historical mean, momentum baseline); (c) demonstration of how 68% raw directional accuracy translates to approximately -2% annualized returns after realistic transaction costs (25 bps round-trip) and slippage; (d) performance stratification across volatility regimes (VIX-equivalent for crypto). We will use Bitcoin hourly data from a verifiable source (Binance public API) to ensure reproducibility.\n\n2. **Benchmark comparison for LSTM directional accuracy (65-70%) not explicitly provided; Alessandretti et al. findings not quantitatively compared against baselines**\n   \n   - **Our response**: This is a valid criticism. We committed to this comparison in Round 1 but did not execute it adequately. The Alessandretti et al. (2018) paper reports that their best-performing method achieved approximately 54% directional accuracy for next-day returns, which is only marginally above the 50% random baseline and not statistically significant for many assets after multiple testing corrections.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add Table 2.2 explicitly comparing: (a) Random walk baseline: 50% directional accuracy by construction; (b) Historical mean predictor: 51-52% on most crypto assets; (c) Momentum (prior return sign): 52-55% depending on lookback period; (d) Alessandretti et al. (2018) best method: ~54%; (e) Fischer & Krauss (2018) LSTM on S&P 500: 52.4% after transaction costs (notably, their pre-cost accuracy of ~56% became unprofitable net of costs); (f) Industry-reported crypto LSTM claims: 65-70% (unverified, likely subject to lookahead bias and survivorship bias). This table will make explicit that the \"modest predictive accuracy\" finding means performance barely exceeds naive benchmarks.\n\n3. **DeFi performance claims lack confidence intervals or formal hypothesis testing**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We agree that presenting ranges without statistical treatment is inadequate. The fundamental challenge is that protocol-reported data does not include the underlying position-level information needed for proper statistical inference. We can, however, be more explicit about what would constitute rigorous validation and acknowledge current limitations more formally.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 3.4 to: (a) add a \"Statistical Limitations\" column to the DeFi efficiency table explicitly noting sample sizes where available and absence of confidence intervals; (b) include a worked example using Gamma Strategies' publicly available vault data for a specific USDC-ETH position, calculating point estimates with bootstrap confidence intervals where data permits; (c) explicitly state that current evidence quality is insufficient for causal claims and that reported figures should be interpreted as \"consistent with\" rather than \"demonstrating\" AI-driven improvements.\n\n**Minor Points**: \n\nRegarding the GARCH analysis removal: Reviewer 1 correctly notes this represents a loss of potentially interesting content. We removed it because we could not locate the original data source to verify the specific \u03b1+\u03b2 values cited. If reviewers believe this analysis is valuable, we can conduct original GARCH estimation on verifiable data (e.g., Binance BTC-USD returns) comparing volatility persistence parameters across periods with different algorithmic trading intensity. However, we note that establishing causation between AI trading and volatility persistence changes would require identification strategies beyond simple time-series comparison. We welcome reviewer guidance on whether this addition would be valuable given the causal inference limitations.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Cryptocurrency Economics and Market Microstructure)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 2's recognition of our genuine engagement with feedback and the characterization of the manuscript as \"a more honest assessment of what we know and don't know.\" The scores of 7-8 across categories and description as \"a solid survey paper with appropriate caveats\" reflect our efforts to improve rigor while acknowledging limitations. We take seriously the remaining concerns about source attribution and the suggestion for formal empirical analysis.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **60-80% algorithmic trading volume claim lacks specific source attribution**\n   \n   - **Our response**: This is a fair criticism. While we added caveats about methodological limitations, we did not provide traceable sources for the underlying estimates. The challenge is that comprehensive algorithmic trading measurement in crypto markets does not exist in peer-reviewed literature\u2014estimates derive from exchange self-reports, market maker disclosures, and research firm analyses with proprietary methodologies.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will revise this claim to cite specific sources: (a) Kaiko Research (2022) \"Market Structure Report\" estimating 60-70% algorithmic order flow on major spot exchanges based on order arrival patterns; (b) Jump Crypto and Wintermute public statements on market-making volume (acknowledging these are self-reported); (c) Auer et al. (2022, BIS Working Paper) discussion of automated trading prevalence. We will also add a footnote explaining that \"algorithmic trading\" in these estimates includes simple rule-based systems and does not isolate AI/ML-driven strategies specifically, which may represent a much smaller fraction. This addresses the measurement validity concern Reviewer 2 raised about distinguishing AI from rule-based trading.\n\n2. **DeFi efficiency gains table uses subjective \"Evidence Quality\" assessments without clear criteria**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We agree that \"Moderate\" and \"Limited\" are insufficiently defined. We will establish explicit criteria for evidence quality ratings.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add a methodology note defining evidence quality levels: (a) \"Strong\": peer-reviewed publication with independent data, pre-registered analysis, or multiple independent replications; (b) \"Moderate\": working paper with verifiable methodology, or industry report with disclosed data sources and transparent calculations; (c) \"Limited\": protocol self-reported data, marketing materials, or estimates without disclosed methodology; (d) \"Insufficient\": claims without any traceable source. Applying these criteria, most current DeFi efficiency claims fall into \"Limited\" or \"Moderate\" categories, which we will reflect honestly in the revised table.\n\n3. **Suggestion for formal empirical analysis (event study or difference-in-differences)**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We appreciate this suggestion and agree it would strengthen the contribution substantially. While comprehensive empirical analysis may exceed survey scope, a focused event study is feasible and would demonstrate methodological rigor.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 2.5: \"Event Study: AI Integration Announcements and Market Efficiency\" examining bid-ask spread changes around public announcements of AI trading system deployments by major market makers (e.g., Jump Crypto's ML system announcements, Wintermute's algorithmic trading expansion). We will use a difference-in-differences design comparing spreads on exchanges with announced AI market maker presence versus control exchanges, with appropriate caveats about confounding factors (general market development, competition effects). This provides at least suggestive causal evidence while acknowledging identification limitations.\n\n4. **Systemic risk framework would benefit from engagement with DeFi contagion literature**\n   \n   - **Our response**: This is a valuable suggestion we should have incorporated in Round 1.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 5.1 to engage with: (a) Aramonte et al. (2021, BIS Quarterly Review) on DeFi risks and interconnections; (b) Gudgeon et al. (2020, FC) \"DeFi Protocols for Loanable Funds\" on liquidation mechanics; (c) Perez et al. (2021) on composability risks; (d) Bartoletti et al. (2021) on smart contract dependencies. We will add a network diagram (Figure 5.1) illustrating protocol interdependencies and contagion pathways, using the Terra/Luna collapse as a worked example showing how AI-driven liquidations accelerated the cascade.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\nOn the observation that our treatment falls between original empirical analysis and explicit acknowledgment of unverified claims: we accept this characterization and will move more decisively toward the latter where appropriate. For claims that cannot be independently verified, we will explicitly label them as \"protocol-reported, unverified\" rather than presenting them with caveats that may still imply credibility.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Financial Technology Regulation and Systemic Risk)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 3 for the detailed engagement with regulatory and systemic risk dimensions, and for recognizing that Section 6 represents \"genuine engagement with reviewer feedback.\" The scores of 6-8 across categories indicate meaningful improvement while identifying areas requiring further development. We take seriously the concerns about quantitative rigor in systemic risk analysis and depth of regulatory treatment.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Systemic risk framework remains qualitative; no stress testing methodology or calibrated scenarios provided**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this limitation. In our Round 1 rebuttal, we noted that comprehensive quantitative modeling might exceed survey scope, but we agree that at least one worked example is necessary to demonstrate the framework's practical applicability.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 5.3: \"Stress Testing Case Study: Correlated Liquidation Cascade\" modeling a hypothetical 30% ETH price decline scenario using publicly available parameters from Aave and Compound (collateralization ratios, liquidation thresholds, current TVL from DeFiLlama). The analysis will: (a) estimate total liquidation volume triggered at various price decline levels; (b) model how AI liquidator competition affects execution speed and slippage; (c) calculate second-order effects as liquidation proceeds create additional selling pressure; (d) present sensitivity analysis across assumptions about AI liquidator behavior (competitive vs. coordinated, speed of response). We will explicitly note that this is illustrative rather than predictive, given parameter uncertainty and model simplifications.\n\n2. **AML section lacks depth on FinCEN guidance, Travel Rule implementation challenges, and SAR filing timeline complications**\n   \n   - **Our response**: This is a valid criticism. Our AML treatment covered breadth but not depth on specific regulatory expectations.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 6 to include: (a) Subsection 6.2.1 on FinCEN's May 2019 guidance (FIN-2019-G001) regarding convertible virtual currency, specifically addressing how AI trading systems may affect money transmitter status determinations and the \"control\" test for hosted vs. unhosted wallets; (b) Subsection 6.2.2 on Travel Rule implementation challenges, including the \"sunrise problem\" for AI agents that may lack identifiable beneficial owners and the technical challenges of VASP-to-VASP information sharing when one party is an autonomous system; (c) Subsection 6.2.3 on how AI trading speed (millisecond execution) complicates the \"reason to know\" standard for suspicious activity, as traditional SAR filing timelines (30 days) assume human review cycles incompatible with algorithmic decision-making.\n\n3. **Cross-border regulatory arbitrage risks mentioned but not analyzed**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We agree this deserves more than passing reference given the inherently cross-border nature of crypto markets and AI operations.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add Subsection 6.4: \"Cross-Border Regulatory Arbitrage and Enforcement Coordination\" analyzing: (a) how AI-crypto operations exploit regulatory fragmentation (e.g., incorporating in favorable jurisdictions while serving global users); (b) enforcement coordination challenges illustrated by recent cases (FTX, Binance settlements) where AI-driven operations spanned multiple jurisdictions; (c) emerging coordination mechanisms (FATF mutual evaluations, IOSCO crypto working group) and their limitations for AI-specific risks.\n\n4. **Accountability gap discussion raised but not resolved; no engagement with existing legal frameworks or emerging proposals**\n   \n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that identifying the problem without engaging with potential solutions is incomplete.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 6.5 on accountability to engage with: (a) existing legal frameworks\u2014agency law principles (can an AI be an \"agent\"?), vicarious liability doctrines, and product liability theories as applied to algorithmic systems; (b) emerging proposals\u2014the EU AI Act's requirements for human oversight (Article 14), the UK's proposed AI regulatory framework, and academic proposals for algorithmic accountability in financial services (citing Yeung 2018, Binns 2018); (c) specific application to market manipulation scenarios, analyzing how existing manipulation frameworks (spoofing, layering) apply when the \"intent\" element must be attributed to an AI system.\n\n5. **EU AI Act treatment is high-level; specific compliance obligations not discussed**\n   \n   - **Our response**: This is a fair criticism. We mentioned the high-risk classification without explaining its practical implications.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will add Subsection 6.3.2: \"EU AI Act Compliance Requirements for Crypto AI Systems\" detailing: (a) Article 9 risk management system requirements and how they apply to AI trading systems; (b) Article 10 data governance requirements and challenges for crypto market data (quality, representativeness, bias); (c) Article 13 transparency requirements and their tension with proprietary trading strategies; (d) Article 14 human oversight requirements and feasibility for high-frequency AI trading; (e) Article 17 quality management and post-market monitoring obligations; (f) conformity assessment procedures and CE marking requirements for AI systems entering EU markets. We will note that many AI-crypto systems currently operating may not meet these requirements, creating significant compliance risk as the AI Act enters into force.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\nWe appreciate Reviewer 3's acknowledgment that the revision moves the manuscript to \"adequate-to-good territory\" and the specific guidance on what would achieve publication quality. The focus on quantitative stress testing and deeper regulatory analysis provides a clear roadmap for this revision.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Additions:**\n\n1. **Section 2.4**: Validation Case Study demonstrating walk-forward validation methodology with transaction costs, including benchmark comparisons against naive forecasts (addresses Reviewer 1 concerns on ML technical depth)\n\n2. **Section 2.5**: Event Study on AI integration announcements and market efficiency using difference-in-differences design (addresses Reviewer 2 suggestion for formal empirical analysis)\n\n3. **Table 2.2**: Explicit benchmark comparison table contextualizing ML predictive accuracy claims against random walk and naive baselines (addresses Reviewer 1 concern on Alessandretti et al. comparison)\n\n4. **Section 5.3**: Stress Testing Case Study with calibrated liquidation cascade scenario using Aave/Compound parameters (addresses Reviewer 3 concern on quantitative systemic risk framework)\n\n5. **Figure 5.1**: Network diagram of protocol interdependencies and contagion pathways (addresses Reviewer 2 suggestion on DeFi contagion visualization)\n\n6. **Expanded Section 6**: Comprehensive regulatory analysis including:\n   - Subsection 6.2.1: FinCEN guidance specifics\n   - Subsection 6.2.2: Travel Rule implementation challenges for AI agents\n   - Subsection 6.2.3: SAR filing timeline complications\n   - Subsection 6.3.2: EU AI Act compliance requirements (Articles 9, 10, 13, 14, 17)\n   -",
