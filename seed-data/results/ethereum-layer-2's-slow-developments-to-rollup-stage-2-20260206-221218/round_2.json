        "The empirical analysis of security council interventions remains largely anecdotal rather than systematic\u2014the authors promised to 'document specific interventions, response times, and categorize whether interventions were for bugs, upgrades, or parameter changes' but only provide three brief examples without timestamps, response times, or categorization",
        "Escape hatch implementation details for ZK rollups remain insufficiently technical\u2014the forced transaction mechanisms for Starknet and zkSync are described at a high level but lack specifics on queue processing timeouts, bond requirements, or the precise conditions triggering 'frozen' states"

      "detailed_feedback": "The revision demonstrates genuine engagement with my Round 1 feedback, and the BOLD protocol section is now publication-quality with appropriate technical depth on the economic security model, permissionless participation, and delay attack prevention. The security council analysis has improved meaningfully with the configuration table, though it would benefit from the empirical intervention analysis the authors committed to in their rebuttal. The distinction between PLONK's trusted setup (KZG ceremony) and STARKs' transparency is now present and correctly characterized. However, I note a gap between the rebuttal's promises and the delivered content regarding ZK prover architectures\u2014the authors stated they would address 'specific prover decentralization approaches (Starknet's SHARP vs. zkSync's prover architecture)' but the manuscript provides only high-level descriptions without the technical depth needed to understand why decentralization is difficult. For instance, SHARP's role in amortizing verification costs across multiple deployments creates economic dependencies that affect decentralization pathways, but this is not explored. Similarly, the escape hatch analysis would benefit from concrete parameters: what is the timeout before Starknet enters 'frozen' state? What are the bond requirements for zkSync's priority queue? These details matter for assessing whether escape hatches provide meaningful user protection. The formal verification section is a welcome addition and appropriately acknowledges the challenges of verifying interactive dispute games, though it could cite specific verification efforts (e.g., Arbitrum's published Certora specifications if available). Overall, this is a solid revision that addresses the majority of my concerns and is approaching publication readiness for the fraud proof and security council dimensions, with remaining gaps primarily in ZK-specific technical depth.",

        "Substantiate audit ecosystem claims with concrete evidence: cite specific audit reports with their scope and duration, reference public statements from audit firms about rollup-specific capacity, or conduct interviews with security researchers to ground the analysis in verifiable information"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "The revision demonstrates genuine engagement with my previous feedback, and Section 4 represents a substantial improvement over the original manuscript's treatment of formal verification and audit practices. The discussion of verification challenges for interactive dispute games (Section 4.1.1) correctly identifies the core difficulty: proving game-theoretic properties across unbounded time horizons exceeds the capabilities of standard verification approaches. Similarly, the acknowledgment that ZK circuit verification requires specialized tooling distinct from Solidity verification tools shows improved technical understanding.\n\nHowever, the revision falls short of the comprehensive treatment promised in the rebuttal. The authors committed to creating 'a table cataloging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities across major rollups' with specific categorization\u2014this table is absent. Instead, Section 4.3 provides narrative descriptions of a handful of incidents (Optimism infinite money bug, zkSync proof verification issues, Polygon zkEVM soundness problems) without the systematic analysis needed to draw statistically meaningful conclusions about discovery timelines. The claim that 'critical vulnerabilities' have an 'average discovery time of 6-18 months' appears to be an estimate rather than a calculated figure from empirical data.\n\nThe verification status table in Section 4.1.1 is a useful addition but lacks precision. Terms like 'Partial,' 'Limited,' and 'Partial (Certora for specific invariants)' do not enable readers to assess actual verification coverage. For a manuscript making claims about Stage 2 readiness timelines, more rigorous treatment is needed. What specific invariants have been verified? What attack vectors remain unverified? Which components of BOLD have formal specifications, and which do not?\n\nThe audit ecosystem discussion (Section 4.2) raises important points about capacity constraints and scope requirements but lacks empirical foundation. The '$1-5 million' cost estimate and '3-6 month' timeline claims would benefit from citations to actual audit reports or industry surveys. The list of 'Stage 2 readiness audit' requirements is sensible but appears to be the authors' construction rather than an industry standard\u2014this should be clarified.\n\nDespite these limitations, the manuscript now provides a reasonable framework for understanding verification and audit barriers to Stage 2. The conditioning of timeline projections on formal verification milestones (as promised in the rebuttal) is partially implemented, though the connection between specific verification achievements and timeline estimates could be more explicit. Overall, this represents a 1.5-2 point improvement from my original assessment, reflecting meaningful but incomplete progress on the identified weaknesses.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "The revision represents genuine and substantial engagement with my previous feedback, and I commend the authors for their responsiveness. The principal-agent analysis in Section 5.2 is a meaningful addition that correctly identifies the competing pressures facing development teams\u2014VC expectations, regulatory exposure, and operational convenience\u2014and explains why voluntary decentralization is economically irrational under current conditions. The security council political economy discussion adds valuable institutional analysis that was entirely absent from the original submission.\n\nHowever, I must note that the promised 'semi-formal model' of coordination failures did not materialize in the revision. The current treatment in Section 5.3 correctly identifies the collective action problem but presents it discursively rather than analytically. A simple formalization\u2014even a basic payoff matrix showing why unilateral Stage 2 transition is dominated by remaining at Stage 1\u2014would transform this from assertion to demonstration. The claim that 'if all rollups simultaneously moved to Stage 2, competitive disadvantages would neutralize' is intuitive but deserves formal treatment to identify the precise conditions under which coordination mechanisms might succeed.\n\nThe token governance analysis, while improved, still treats governance failure as somewhat exogenous rather than deriving it from first principles. Why don't token holders pressure for decentralization? The manuscript notes low participation and delegation concentration but doesn't fully explain the underlying mechanisms\u2014rational ignorance (the cost of becoming informed exceeds individual benefits), free-riding on others' governance participation, or the selection effects that concentrate delegation among parties aligned with development teams. Engaging with established political economy literature would strengthen this section considerably.\n\nFinally, the absence of empirical grounding for market pressure claims remains a weakness. The rebuttal acknowledged that 'clean natural experiments are rare,' but this understates what's possible. Even qualitative analysis of TVL movements following the Optimism bug disclosure, or user forum discussions during Arbitrum outages, would provide evidence beyond assertion. The claim that 'users consistently choose lower-fee options regardless of staging' is testable and should be supported.\n\nDespite these remaining gaps, the manuscript has improved from adequate to strong. The governance economics dimension is now meaningfully addressed, and the analysis provides valuable insights for both practitioners and researchers. With the suggested refinements\u2014particularly the game-theoretic formalization and empirical grounding\u2014this would approach publication-ready quality for the governance and incentives dimensions.",

While I don't view these gaps as fatal\u2014the manuscript is valuable without them\u2014the authors should either deliver on these commitments or explicitly acknowledge scope limitations. The reviewers are applying reasonable standards for a research publication, though I note Reviewer 2's demands for quantitative verification coverage metrics may be unrealistic given that such data is often proprietary or nonexistent.\n\nGiven the strong improvement trajectory, the substantive contribution to understanding rollup security tradeoffs, and the fact that remaining issues are clearly fixable rather than fundamental, I am recommending minor revision rather than another major revision cycle.

  "author_rebuttal": "## Author Rebuttal - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript and their detailed, constructive feedback. The reviews demonstrate careful reading of our revisions and provide clear guidance on remaining gaps. We are encouraged that all reviewers recognize substantial improvement from Round 1, with scores reflecting meaningful progress toward publication readiness.\n\nThree themes emerge across the reviews: (1) promises made in our Round 1 rebuttal that were incompletely delivered, particularly the systematic bug taxonomy table and semi-formal coordination model; (2) insufficient empirical grounding for claims about audit costs, verification coverage, and user behavior; and (3) remaining technical depth gaps in ZK prover architectures and escape hatch mechanisms. We take seriously the observation that our rebuttal commitments exceeded our delivery, and we commit to more measured promises in this response\u2014focusing on specific, achievable improvements. Our revision strategy prioritizes the concrete deliverables reviewers identified as missing, with explicit acknowledgment where data limitations prevent the rigor we would prefer.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Rollup Architecture and Security Engineering)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 1's recognition that our BOLD protocol coverage is now \"publication-quality\" and that the security council analysis has \"improved meaningfully.\" The 7.6/10 average reflects genuine progress, and we accept the criticism that gaps remain between our Round 1 promises and delivered content, particularly regarding ZK prover architectures and empirical security council analysis.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **ZK prover decentralization lacks promised technical depth (SHARP aggregation, Boojum architecture)**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this gap and accept responsibility for overpromising in Round 1. The technical details of SHARP's proof aggregation and zkSync's Boojum prover are not comprehensively documented in public sources, which contributed to our surface-level treatment. However, we can and should do better with available information.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 3.4 to include: (a) SHARP's batch collection mechanism, explaining how proofs from multiple StarkEx deployments (dYdX, Immutable X, Sorare) and Starknet mainnet are aggregated into recursive proofs submitted to L1, with explicit discussion of the trust implications\u2014specifically, that shared prover infrastructure creates correlated failure risk across deployments; (b) Boojum's transition from PLONK to a custom proving system optimized for GPU acceleration, noting the tradeoff between prover efficiency and decentralization (specialized hardware requirements raise barriers to permissionless proving); (c) explicit acknowledgment of documentation limitations and citation of primary sources (StarkWare's technical blog posts, zkSync's GitHub repositories) rather than implying comprehensive coverage we cannot provide.\n\n2. **Security council intervention analysis remains anecdotal rather than systematic**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism fully. Our Round 1 commitment to document \"specific interventions, response times, and categorize whether interventions were for bugs, upgrades, or parameter changes\" was not fulfilled. This was an oversight in our revision process.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Table 3 documenting all publicly disclosed security council interventions across Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, with columns for: date, rollup, intervention type (categorized as bug fix, parameter change, upgrade, or emergency response), approximate response time where determinable from on-chain data or public communications, and analysis of whether the intervention would have been possible under Stage 2 constraints. We have identified at least seven documented interventions through governance forum posts and on-chain records. Where response times cannot be precisely determined, we will note this limitation rather than omit the entry.\n\n3. **Escape hatch implementation details insufficiently technical**\n   - **Our response**: This is a fair criticism. The escape hatch mechanisms represent critical user protection, and our high-level treatment does not enable readers to assess their practical effectiveness.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 3.5.1 on escape hatch specifications including: (a) Starknet's forced transaction mechanism with the 7-day timeout period before the system enters frozen state, the on-chain queue structure, and the conditions under which users can withdraw without operator cooperation; (b) zkSync's priority queue with its 72-hour processing requirement, the absence of bond requirements for users (distinguishing from sequencer bonds), and the explicit state machine for what occurs if the operator fails to process priority transactions; (c) comparative analysis of these mechanisms' effectiveness if the prover goes offline, noting that ZK rollup escape hatches have not been tested under adversarial conditions in production.\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We will add citations to Arbitrum's published Certora specifications in the formal verification section, as suggested. We have located the relevant repository and can reference specific verified invariants.\n- The distinction between PLONK's trusted setup and STARKs' transparency will be expanded with a brief explanation of why this matters for decentralization (trusted setup ceremonies create coordination requirements that affect upgrade processes).\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Smart Contract Formal Verification and Audit Practices)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 2's recognition that Section 4 represents \"a substantial improvement\" and that our discussion of verification challenges \"shows improved technical understanding.\" The 6.8/10 average reflects legitimate concerns about missing empirical content, and we accept that our revision fell short of commitments made in Round 1.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Promised bug taxonomy table is absent**\n   - **Our response**: We apologize for this omission. The table was drafted but excluded during revision due to concerns about completeness\u2014we were unable to verify discovery dates for several incidents and chose not to include partial data. In retrospect, we should have included available data with explicit notation of gaps rather than omitting the table entirely.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Table 4 cataloging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with columns for: rollup, date disclosed, component (bridge/proof system/sequencer/other), severity (critical/high/medium per project's own classification where available), discovery method (internal audit/external audit/bug bounty/independent researcher/incident), time from deployment to discovery where determinable, and resolution mechanism. We have compiled 14 incidents with sufficient public documentation. For approximately 4 incidents, deployment-to-discovery time cannot be precisely determined; these will be marked as \"unknown\" rather than estimated. We will explicitly note that this represents publicly disclosed vulnerabilities only and likely underestimates total vulnerability counts.\n\n2. **Verification coverage metrics remain vague**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is valid, and we must be transparent about a fundamental limitation: rollup teams do not publicly report verification coverage metrics in standardized formats. Our vague language (\"partial,\" \"limited\") reflects genuine uncertainty rather than imprecision on our part.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 4.1.1 to: (a) explicitly state that standardized verification coverage metrics are not publicly available for any major rollup; (b) document what is known\u2014for Arbitrum, we can cite specific Certora rule specifications from their public repository and list the invariants covered (e.g., bridge balance consistency, withdrawal finalization conditions) without claiming percentage coverage; (c) for zkSync and Starknet, acknowledge that verification efforts are referenced in documentation but specific coverage is not disclosed; (d) recommend in Section 6 that standardized verification reporting become an industry norm for Stage 2 readiness assessment. We believe this honest acknowledgment of data limitations is more valuable than false precision.\n\n3. **Audit ecosystem claims lack empirical grounding**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. Our cost and timeline estimates were based on informal conversations with security researchers and should have been presented as such or omitted.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 4.2 to: (a) cite specific publicly available audit reports with disclosed scope, duration, and (where available) cost\u2014we have identified audit reports from Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, and Spearbit for major rollups that include scope descriptions; (b) replace unsourced cost estimates with ranges derived from cited reports or remove them if insufficient public data exists; (c) qualify the claim about audit firm expertise by citing the specific firms that have published rollup security research (listing firms with public rollup audit track records) rather than making unsubstantiated assertions about industry capacity. Where we rely on informal knowledge, we will note this explicitly.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- We will clarify that the \"Stage 2 readiness audit\" requirements list represents our proposed framework rather than an industry standard, as the reviewer correctly notes.\n- The connection between verification milestones and timeline estimates will be made more explicit by adding conditional language: \"Timeline projections assume completion of [specific verification milestone]; delays in verification would extend estimates proportionally.\"\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Blockchain Governance and Decentralization Economics)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 3 for recognizing that our revision represents \"genuine and substantial engagement\" with previous feedback and that the governance economics dimension is now \"meaningfully addressed.\" The 7.6/10 average reflects remaining gaps in analytical rigor, particularly the absent semi-formal model we promised.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Promised semi-formal coordination model not present**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this unfulfilled commitment. Our Round 1 rebuttal promised a \"semi-formal model\" that we did not deliver. We underestimated the complexity of formalizing the coordination problem in a way that would add analytical value beyond our discursive treatment.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Figure 2, a 2x2 game matrix as the reviewer suggests, illustrating the coordination problem. The matrix will show payoffs for Rollup A and B choosing between \"Stage 2\" and \"Remain Stage 1,\" with payoff structure reflecting: (a) mutual Stage 1 as Nash equilibrium due to competitive parity; (b) unilateral Stage 2 as dominated strategy due to user migration to lower-friction competitors; (c) mutual Stage 2 as Pareto-superior but unstable without coordination mechanism. We will include brief formal notation defining the payoff conditions under which coordination mechanisms (binding commitments, external requirements) shift the equilibrium. This is achievable within space constraints and directly addresses the reviewer's request.\n\n2. **Token governance failure analysis lacks theoretical grounding**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we describe symptoms without fully theorizing structural causes. We should connect our observations to established political economy literature.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 5.2.2 to explicitly engage with Olson's Logic of Collective Action, explaining how the free-rider problem applies to governance participation (individual token holders bear costs of becoming informed while benefits of good governance are diffuse), and how rational ignorance explains low participation rates even among sophisticated holders. We will also add analysis of delegation concentration as a selection effect: delegates who seek delegation tend to be those with interests in the protocol's operational decisions (development teams, large investors), creating systematic bias against decentralization pressure. These additions require approximately 400 words and substantially strengthen the theoretical foundation.\n\n3. **Missing empirical analysis of user behavior during security incidents**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that empirical grounding would strengthen our claims about market pressure insufficiency. While clean natural experiments are difficult, qualitative case analysis is feasible.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 5.5 presenting a case study of TVL and user behavior following the Optimism infinite money bug disclosure (February 2022). This incident is well-documented, occurred at a time when Optimism had meaningful TVL, and the bug was publicly disclosed with sufficient detail to assess severity. We will analyze: (a) TVL movements in the 30 days following disclosure compared to baseline and competing rollups; (b) governance forum discussions and user sentiment; (c) whether the incident produced measurable pressure toward decentralization (spoiler: it did not). We acknowledge this single case study cannot prove market pressure insufficiency but provides concrete evidence beyond assertion.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- We will add a brief discussion of why rational token holders might delegate to parties aligned with development teams, connecting to the literature on informed intermediaries in corporate governance.\n- The claim about users choosing lower-fee options will be qualified with available evidence (L2Beat fee comparisons and TVL rankings) while acknowledging that fee sensitivity cannot be cleanly isolated from other factors affecting rollup choice.\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Additions**:\n1.

Audit ecosystem claims revised with citations to specific public audit reports or qualified as informal knowledge\n3. Stage 2 readiness audit requirements clarified as authors' proposed framework\n4. Timeline projections explicitly conditioned on verification milestones\n\n**Clarifications**:\n1. PLONK trusted setup vs. STARK transparency implications for upgrade processes\n2. Citation of Arbitrum's published Certora specifications\n3. Qualification of user fee sensitivity claims with available evidence\n\nWe believe these revisions address the substantive concerns raised by all three reviewers while remaining achievable within a reasonable revision timeline. We have been careful to commit only to additions we can deliver with appropriate rigor, learning from our Round 1 experience of overpromising. We thank the reviewers for their patience and continued engagement with our work.",
