The paper correctly notes that 'market forces have not penalized centralization' but treats this as an exogenous fact rather than an endogenous outcome of specific institutional arrangements. A more rigorous analysis would examine why: (1) information asymmetries prevent users from pricing staging into their decisions; (2) switching costs and liquidity network effects create lock-in that insulates Stage 0 systems from competition; (3) the absence of credible commitment mechanisms prevents rollup teams from binding themselves to decentralization timelines. The section on security council economics is particularly thin\u2014these councils represent fascinating governance experiments where a small group holds enormous power over billions in assets, yet the paper doesn't analyze their composition, compensation structures, or the political dynamics of their decision-making. The regulatory uncertainty discussion would benefit from engagement with the 'sufficient decentralization' doctrine and how staging might interact with securities law safe harbors. Finally, the paper's recommendations are generic; more specific mechanism design proposals\u2014such as bonding requirements for teams that miss decentralization milestones, or protocol-level staging requirements for canonical bridge inclusion\u2014would demonstrate deeper engagement with the governance design space.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a formal verification and audit perspective, this manuscript has significant gaps that undermine its timeline projections and technical analysis. The claim that Arbitrum could achieve Stage 2 by Q4 2025 is presented without any discussion of the formal verification status of BOLD or the dispute resolution contracts. Interactive fraud proof systems present particularly challenging verification problems due to their game-theoretic nature and the need to verify properties across multiple execution paths and timeout scenarios. The manuscript should address whether any rollup has achieved meaningful formal verification coverage of their core contracts, and what 'meaningful' even means in this context.\n\nThe audit dimension is similarly underexplored. Stage 2 readiness implicitly requires that smart contracts be sufficiently battle-tested, but the manuscript provides no framework for what constitutes adequate testing. Industry practice typically involves multiple independent audits, extended bug bounty periods, formal verification of critical invariants, and extensive fuzzing campaigns. The manuscript should examine whether current audit firm capacity and methodologies are adequate for the complexity of rollup systems, particularly ZK circuits which require specialized expertise.\n\nThe historical bug analysis is particularly weak. The Optimism infinite money bug is mentioned as justification for security council intervention, but there's no systematic examination of: (1) how this bug was discovered, (2) what class of vulnerability it represents, (3) whether formal verification could have caught it, and (4) what this implies for the timeline to achieve sufficient confidence for Stage 2. A rigorous analysis would examine all publicly disclosed vulnerabilities across major rollups, categorize them by discovery method (audit, bug bounty, formal verification, production incident), and use this data to inform realistic battle-testing periods. The current timeline projections appear speculative rather than grounded in empirical bug discovery patterns.",

The fraud proof discussion correctly identifies key challenges (determinism, gas metering, timeout calibration) but misses critical recent developments. Arbitrum's BOLD protocol represents a fundamental architectural shift from the older interactive fraud proof system\u2014it enables permissionless participation through a novel all-vs-all dispute mechanism with bounded delay guarantees, yet the manuscript treats fraud proofs as a monolithic concept. Similarly, the claim that 'Base has not activated fraud proofs' requires clarification: Base operates on the OP Stack which now has fault proofs deployed on mainnet (as of mid-2024), though the security council retains override capability. The security council analysis would benefit from examining the actual governance structures\u2014Arbitrum's 9-of-12 Security Council with specific named entities versus Optimism's Guardian role and its relationship to the Security Council. The manuscript correctly notes that Stage 2 requires 30-day upgrade delays, but doesn't adequately explore the nuanced middle ground of 'adjudication-based' upgrades where on-chain governance can accelerate changes. For ZK rollups, the escape hatch discussion is particularly thin\u2014Starknet's forced transaction mechanism through L1 and zkSync's priority queue system deserve detailed treatment as these are the actual technical implementations that enable trustless exit. The sequencer decentralization section mentions 'based sequencing' but doesn't engage with the MEV implications or the Espresso/Astria shared sequencing tradeoffs in sufficient depth. Finally, the censorship resistance analysis should distinguish between soft censorship (transaction delay) and hard censorship (permanent exclusion), as Stage 1 and Stage 2 systems have different guarantees for each.",

      "author_rebuttal": "## Author Rebuttal - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their constructive feedback. The reviews collectively identify important gaps in our analysis across governance economics, formal verification practices, and technical architecture\u2014areas where deeper treatment will substantially strengthen the paper's contribution.\n\nWe observe three major themes across the reviews: (1) insufficient depth on the incentive structures and game-theoretic dynamics underlying decentralization delays, (2) absence of systematic analysis of formal verification status and audit practices that inform realistic timeline estimates, and (3) need for greater technical precision regarding fraud proof mechanisms, ZK prover architectures, and security council configurations. We accept these critiques as valid and outline below a comprehensive revision strategy that addresses each concern while maintaining the paper's accessibility to a broad audience. Our revised manuscript will add approximately 2,500-3,000 words to accommodate the requested depth while restructuring certain sections for improved analytical rigor.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Blockchain Governance and Decentralization Economics)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the reviewer's score of 6.4/10 and recognize that the governance and economic incentive dimensions require substantially deeper treatment. The reviewer correctly identifies that we treat market failure as exogenous rather than analyzing the specific mechanisms that produce it\u2014this is a significant analytical gap we will address.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Insufficient analysis of principal-agent problems between rollup teams, token holders, and users**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer raises a crucial point. Our current treatment of governance token immaturity is descriptive rather than analytical. We will develop a dedicated subsection examining why token governance fails to pressure teams toward decentralization, including: (a) information asymmetries where token holders lack technical expertise to evaluate staging progress, (b) misaligned time horizons between short-term token speculators and long-term security concerns, and (c) the concentration of voting power among VCs and team members whose interests diverge from users.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section titled \"Principal-Agent Dynamics in Rollup Governance\" (~600 words) that formally characterizes these relationships and explains why voluntary decentralization is economically irrational under current institutional arrangements.\n\n2. **Underdeveloped competitive dynamics and missing collective action analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We fully agree that the collective action problem deserves explicit treatment. The reviewer's framing is precisely correct: if all rollups simultaneously moved to Stage 2, competitive disadvantages would neutralize, but no individual rollup has incentive to move first. We will formalize this as a coordination game and discuss potential mechanisms for overcoming it.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand the competitive dynamics section to include: (a) a semi-formal model of the first-mover disadvantage in decentralization, (b) analysis of network effects and switching costs that insulate Stage 0/1 systems, and (c) discussion of potential coordination mechanisms (e.g., Ethereum Foundation signaling, canonical bridge requirements, or collective commitment devices).\n\n3. **Missing analysis of security council political economy**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is well-founded. Security councils represent a fascinating and underexplored governance structure, and our current treatment is indeed thin. We will add analysis of council composition, compensation structures (where publicly available), and the collective action problems facing sunset mechanisms.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a subsection on \"Security Council Political Economy\" (~400 words) examining the Arbitrum Security Council's 9-of-12 structure with named entities, Optimism's Guardian role, and the incentive structures facing council members who must balance responsiveness against the goal of their own obsolescence.\n\n**Minor Points**: \n\nRegarding the suggestion to add empirical analysis of user behavior and TVL flows during security incidents\u2014we appreciate this idea but note that clean natural experiments are rare, as security incidents typically involve multiple confounding factors. However, we will add qualitative discussion of user responses to disclosed vulnerabilities and note this as an important area for future empirical research. We will also engage with the \"sufficient decentralization\" doctrine from securities law, though we note this requires careful treatment given ongoing regulatory uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Smart Contract Formal Verification and Audit Practices)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's score of 5.6/10 and accept that the formal verification and audit dimensions are significantly underrepresented in our current manuscript. This is perhaps the most substantial gap identified across all reviews, and we commit to comprehensive revisions in this area.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Critically absent discussion of formal verification progress**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that we fail to address formal verification tools, coverage metrics, or the specific challenges of verifying interactive fraud proof systems. This omission significantly weakens our timeline projections.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated section titled \"Formal Verification Status and Challenges\" (~700 words) covering: (a) verification tools employed by major rollups (Certora, Halmos, KEVM, and custom tools), (b) which components have achieved meaningful verification coverage, (c) specific challenges in verifying BOLD's game-theoretic dispute resolution across multiple execution paths, and (d) the fundamental limitations of current verification approaches for complex interactive systems.\n\n2. **No substantive analysis of audit ecosystem maturity**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. Our mention of \"additional testing and audit cycles\" is vague and fails to examine what Stage 2 readiness actually requires from an audit perspective.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add analysis of: (a) the number of firms with rollup-specific audit capability and their capacity constraints, (b) typical audit scope, duration, and cost for Stage 2 readiness assessments, (c) current industry standards (multiple independent audits, invariant testing, fuzzing campaigns, extended bug bounty periods) and whether they are adequate for rollup complexity, and (d) specific gaps in ZK circuit audit expertise.\n\n3. **Lack of systematic bug taxonomy and discovery pattern analysis**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that our historical bug references are anecdotal rather than systematic. We will develop a more rigorous empirical foundation for timeline estimates.\n   - **Action taken**: We will create a table cataloging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities across major rollups, categorized by: (a) discovery method (audit, bug bounty, formal verification, production incident), (b) component affected (bridge, sequencer, prover, escape hatch), (c) severity and potential impact, and (d) time-to-discovery from deployment. We acknowledge data limitations\u2014not all vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed\u2014but will use available information to inform more grounded timeline projections.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\nWe appreciate the specific example regarding Arbitrum's BOLD verification status. Our revised timeline projections will explicitly condition on formal verification milestones rather than presenting dates without methodological grounding. We will also discuss what \"meaningful\" verification coverage means in this context, acknowledging that 100% coverage is neither achievable nor necessarily the appropriate benchmark.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Rollup Architecture and Security Engineering)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for the score of 6.6/10 and the detailed technical feedback. The reviewer correctly identifies several areas where our technical treatment lacks precision or misses recent developments.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Insufficient technical depth on fraud proof mechanisms, particularly BOLD**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. Our treatment of fraud proofs as a \"monolithic concept\" fails to capture the significant architectural innovations in BOLD's permissionless bonding and all-vs-all dispute resolution mechanism.\n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand the fraud proof section to include: (a) detailed comparison of BOLD's architecture versus Arbitrum Classic's interactive fraud proofs, (b) explanation of the economic security model (bonding requirements, delay bounds), (c) how BOLD achieves permissionless participation while preventing delay attacks, and (d) the verification challenges specific to this new architecture.\n\n2. **Validity proof section underrepresents ZK prover decentralization complexity**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that we fail to address proof aggregation, recursive proving, and the cryptographic assumption differences (trusted setup for PLONK vs. transparent STARKs) that affect decentralization pathways.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand the ZK rollup section to address: (a) the distinction between validity proofs and data availability proofs, (b) specific prover architectures (Starknet's SHARP vs. zkSync's approach), (c) escape hatch implementation details including forced transaction inclusion mechanisms, and (d) how different cryptographic assumptions create different trust and decentralization tradeoffs.\n\n3. **Inaccuracy regarding Base's fraud proof status**\n   - **Our response**: We thank the reviewer for this correction. The OP Stack fault proofs were indeed deployed on mainnet in mid-2024, and our characterization requires updating.\n   - **Action taken**: We will correct this factual error and clarify that Base operates with fault proofs active but with security council override capability retained\u2014an important distinction for staging classification.\n\n4. **Security council analysis lacks specificity on configurations**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that our analysis should distinguish between actual multisig configurations and the critical difference between instant upgrade capabilities versus time-delayed upgrades with council veto power.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a table documenting security council configurations across major rollups, including multisig thresholds, known key holder identities (where public), and the specific powers retained (instant upgrade, delayed upgrade with veto, emergency pause, etc.).\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\nWe will address the reviewer's point about distinguishing soft censorship (transaction delay) from hard censorship (permanent exclusion) and how Stage 1 and Stage 2 systems provide different guarantees for each. We will also expand our discussion of based sequencing to engage more substantively with MEV implications and the Espresso/Astria shared sequencing tradeoffs, though we note this could merit its own dedicated paper given the complexity involved.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Revisions Planned:**\n1.

The security council analysis has improved meaningfully with the configuration table, though it would benefit from the empirical intervention analysis the authors committed to in their rebuttal. The distinction between PLONK's trusted setup (KZG ceremony) and STARKs' transparency is now present and correctly characterized. However, I note a gap between the rebuttal's promises and the delivered content regarding ZK prover architectures\u2014the authors stated they would address 'specific prover decentralization approaches (Starknet's SHARP vs. zkSync's prover architecture)' but the manuscript provides only high-level descriptions without the technical depth needed to understand why decentralization is difficult. For instance, SHARP's role in amortizing verification costs across multiple deployments creates economic dependencies that affect decentralization pathways, but this is not explored. Similarly, the escape hatch analysis would benefit from concrete parameters: what is the timeout before Starknet enters 'frozen' state? What are the bond requirements for zkSync's priority queue? These details matter for assessing whether escape hatches provide meaningful user protection. The formal verification section is a welcome addition and appropriately acknowledges the challenges of verifying interactive dispute games, though it could cite specific verification efforts (e.g., Arbitrum's published Certora specifications if available). Overall, this is a solid revision that addresses the majority of my concerns and is approaching publication readiness for the fraud proof and security council dimensions, with remaining gaps primarily in ZK-specific technical depth.",

          "detailed_feedback": "The revision demonstrates genuine engagement with my previous feedback, and Section 4 represents a substantial improvement over the original manuscript's treatment of formal verification and audit practices. The discussion of verification challenges for interactive dispute games (Section 4.1.1) correctly identifies the core difficulty: proving game-theoretic properties across unbounded time horizons exceeds the capabilities of standard verification approaches. Similarly, the acknowledgment that ZK circuit verification requires specialized tooling distinct from Solidity verification tools shows improved technical understanding.\n\nHowever, the revision falls short of the comprehensive treatment promised in the rebuttal. The authors committed to creating 'a table cataloging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities across major rollups' with specific categorization\u2014this table is absent. Instead, Section 4.3 provides narrative descriptions of a handful of incidents (Optimism infinite money bug, zkSync proof verification issues, Polygon zkEVM soundness problems) without the systematic analysis needed to draw statistically meaningful conclusions about discovery timelines. The claim that 'critical vulnerabilities' have an 'average discovery time of 6-18 months' appears to be an estimate rather than a calculated figure from empirical data.\n\nThe verification status table in Section 4.1.1 is a useful addition but lacks precision. Terms like 'Partial,' 'Limited,' and 'Partial (Certora for specific invariants)' do not enable readers to assess actual verification coverage. For a manuscript making claims about Stage 2 readiness timelines, more rigorous treatment is needed. What specific invariants have been verified? What attack vectors remain unverified? Which components of BOLD have formal specifications, and which do not?\n\nThe audit ecosystem discussion (Section 4.2) raises important points about capacity constraints and scope requirements but lacks empirical foundation. The '$1-5 million' cost estimate and '3-6 month' timeline claims would benefit from citations to actual audit reports or industry surveys. The list of 'Stage 2 readiness audit' requirements is sensible but appears to be the authors' construction rather than an industry standard\u2014this should be clarified.\n\nDespite these limitations, the manuscript now provides a reasonable framework for understanding verification and audit barriers to Stage 2. The conditioning of timeline projections on formal verification milestones (as promised in the rebuttal) is partially implemented, though the connection between specific verification achievements and timeline estimates could be more explicit. Overall, this represents a 1.5-2 point improvement from my original assessment, reflecting meaningful but incomplete progress on the identified weaknesses.",

The principal-agent analysis in Section 5.2 is a meaningful addition that correctly identifies the competing pressures facing development teams\u2014VC expectations, regulatory exposure, and operational convenience\u2014and explains why voluntary decentralization is economically irrational under current conditions. The security council political economy discussion adds valuable institutional analysis that was entirely absent from the original submission.\n\nHowever, I must note that the promised 'semi-formal model' of coordination failures did not materialize in the revision. The current treatment in Section 5.3 correctly identifies the collective action problem but presents it discursively rather than analytically. A simple formalization\u2014even a basic payoff matrix showing why unilateral Stage 2 transition is dominated by remaining at Stage 1\u2014would transform this from assertion to demonstration. The claim that 'if all rollups simultaneously moved to Stage 2, competitive disadvantages would neutralize' is intuitive but deserves formal treatment to identify the precise conditions under which coordination mechanisms might succeed.\n\nThe token governance analysis, while improved, still treats governance failure as somewhat exogenous rather than deriving it from first principles. Why don't token holders pressure for decentralization? The manuscript notes low participation and delegation concentration but doesn't fully explain the underlying mechanisms\u2014rational ignorance (the cost of becoming informed exceeds individual benefits), free-riding on others' governance participation, or the selection effects that concentrate delegation among parties aligned with development teams. Engaging with established political economy literature would strengthen this section considerably.\n\nFinally, the absence of empirical grounding for market pressure claims remains a weakness. The rebuttal acknowledged that 'clean natural experiments are rare,' but this understates what's possible. Even qualitative analysis of TVL movements following the Optimism bug disclosure, or user forum discussions during Arbitrum outages, would provide evidence beyond assertion. The claim that 'users consistently choose lower-fee options regardless of staging' is testable and should be supported.\n\nDespite these remaining gaps, the manuscript has improved from adequate to strong. The governance economics dimension is now meaningfully addressed, and the analysis provides valuable insights for both practitioners and researchers. With the suggested refinements\u2014particularly the game-theoretic formalization and empirical grounding\u2014this would approach publication-ready quality for the governance and incentives dimensions.",

      "author_rebuttal": "## Author Rebuttal - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript and their detailed, constructive feedback. The reviews demonstrate careful reading of our revisions and provide clear guidance on remaining gaps. We are encouraged that all reviewers recognize substantial improvement from Round 1, with scores reflecting meaningful progress toward publication readiness.\n\nThree themes emerge across the reviews: (1) promises made in our Round 1 rebuttal that were incompletely delivered, particularly the systematic bug taxonomy table and semi-formal coordination model; (2) insufficient empirical grounding for claims about audit costs, verification coverage, and user behavior; and (3) remaining technical depth gaps in ZK prover architectures and escape hatch mechanisms. We take seriously the observation that our rebuttal commitments exceeded our delivery, and we commit to more measured promises in this response\u2014focusing on specific, achievable improvements. Our revision strategy prioritizes the concrete deliverables reviewers identified as missing, with explicit acknowledgment where data limitations prevent the rigor we would prefer.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Rollup Architecture and Security Engineering)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 1's recognition that our BOLD protocol coverage is now \"publication-quality\" and that the security council analysis has \"improved meaningfully.\" The 7.6/10 average reflects genuine progress, and we accept the criticism that gaps remain between our Round 1 promises and delivered content, particularly regarding ZK prover architectures and empirical security council analysis.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **ZK prover decentralization lacks promised technical depth (SHARP aggregation, Boojum architecture)**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this gap and accept responsibility for overpromising in Round 1. The technical details of SHARP's proof aggregation and zkSync's Boojum prover are not comprehensively documented in public sources, which contributed to our surface-level treatment. However, we can and should do better with available information.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 3.4 to include: (a) SHARP's batch collection mechanism, explaining how proofs from multiple StarkEx deployments (dYdX, Immutable X, Sorare) and Starknet mainnet are aggregated into recursive proofs submitted to L1, with explicit discussion of the trust implications\u2014specifically, that shared prover infrastructure creates correlated failure risk across deployments; (b) Boojum's transition from PLONK to a custom proving system optimized for GPU acceleration, noting the tradeoff between prover efficiency and decentralization (specialized hardware requirements raise barriers to permissionless proving); (c) explicit acknowledgment of documentation limitations and citation of primary sources (StarkWare's technical blog posts, zkSync's GitHub repositories) rather than implying comprehensive coverage we cannot provide.\n\n2. **Security council intervention analysis remains anecdotal rather than systematic**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism fully. Our Round 1 commitment to document \"specific interventions, response times, and categorize whether interventions were for bugs, upgrades, or parameter changes\" was not fulfilled. This was an oversight in our revision process.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Table 3 documenting all publicly disclosed security council interventions across Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, with columns for: date, rollup, intervention type (categorized as bug fix, parameter change, upgrade, or emergency response), approximate response time where determinable from on-chain data or public communications, and analysis of whether the intervention would have been possible under Stage 2 constraints. We have identified at least seven documented interventions through governance forum posts and on-chain records. Where response times cannot be precisely determined, we will note this limitation rather than omit the entry.\n\n3. **Escape hatch implementation details insufficiently technical**\n   - **Our response**: This is a fair criticism. The escape hatch mechanisms represent critical user protection, and our high-level treatment does not enable readers to assess their practical effectiveness.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 3.5.1 on escape hatch specifications including: (a) Starknet's forced transaction mechanism with the 7-day timeout period before the system enters frozen state, the on-chain queue structure, and the conditions under which users can withdraw without operator cooperation; (b) zkSync's priority queue with its 72-hour processing requirement, the absence of bond requirements for users (distinguishing from sequencer bonds), and the explicit state machine for what occurs if the operator fails to process priority transactions; (c) comparative analysis of these mechanisms' effectiveness if the prover goes offline, noting that ZK rollup escape hatches have not been tested under adversarial conditions in production.\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We will add citations to Arbitrum's published Certora specifications in the formal verification section, as suggested. We have located the relevant repository and can reference specific verified invariants.\n- The distinction between PLONK's trusted setup and STARKs' transparency will be expanded with a brief explanation of why this matters for decentralization (trusted setup ceremonies create coordination requirements that affect upgrade processes).\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Smart Contract Formal Verification and Audit Practices)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 2's recognition that Section 4 represents \"a substantial improvement\" and that our discussion of verification challenges \"shows improved technical understanding.\" The 6.8/10 average reflects legitimate concerns about missing empirical content, and we accept that our revision fell short of commitments made in Round 1.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Promised bug taxonomy table is absent**\n   - **Our response**: We apologize for this omission. The table was drafted but excluded during revision due to concerns about completeness\u2014we were unable to verify discovery dates for several incidents and chose not to include partial data. In retrospect, we should have included available data with explicit notation of gaps rather than omitting the table entirely.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Table 4 cataloging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with columns for: rollup, date disclosed, component (bridge/proof system/sequencer/other), severity (critical/high/medium per project's own classification where available), discovery method (internal audit/external audit/bug bounty/independent researcher/incident), time from deployment to discovery where determinable, and resolution mechanism. We have compiled 14 incidents with sufficient public documentation. For approximately 4 incidents, deployment-to-discovery time cannot be precisely determined; these will be marked as \"unknown\" rather than estimated. We will explicitly note that this represents publicly disclosed vulnerabilities only and likely underestimates total vulnerability counts.\n\n2. **Verification coverage metrics remain vague**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is valid, and we must be transparent about a fundamental limitation: rollup teams do not publicly report verification coverage metrics in standardized formats. Our vague language (\"partial,\" \"limited\") reflects genuine uncertainty rather than imprecision on our part.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 4.1.1 to: (a) explicitly state that standardized verification coverage metrics are not publicly available for any major rollup; (b) document what is known\u2014for Arbitrum, we can cite specific Certora rule specifications from their public repository and list the invariants covered (e.g., bridge balance consistency, withdrawal finalization conditions) without claiming percentage coverage; (c) for zkSync and Starknet, acknowledge that verification efforts are referenced in documentation but specific coverage is not disclosed; (d) recommend in Section 6 that standardized verification reporting become an industry norm for Stage 2 readiness assessment. We believe this honest acknowledgment of data limitations is more valuable than false precision.\n\n3. **Audit ecosystem claims lack empirical grounding**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. Our cost and timeline estimates were based on informal conversations with security researchers and should have been presented as such or omitted.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 4.2 to: (a) cite specific publicly available audit reports with disclosed scope, duration, and (where available) cost\u2014we have identified audit reports from Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, and Spearbit for major rollups that include scope descriptions; (b) replace unsourced cost estimates with ranges derived from cited reports or remove them if insufficient public data exists; (c) qualify the claim about audit firm expertise by citing the specific firms that have published rollup security research (listing firms with public rollup audit track records) rather than making unsubstantiated assertions about industry capacity. Where we rely on informal knowledge, we will note this explicitly.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- We will clarify that the \"Stage 2 readiness audit\" requirements list represents our proposed framework rather than an industry standard, as the reviewer correctly notes.\n- The connection between verification milestones and timeline estimates will be made more explicit by adding conditional language: \"Timeline projections assume completion of [specific verification milestone]; delays in verification would extend estimates proportionally.\"\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Blockchain Governance and Decentralization Economics)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 3 for recognizing that our revision represents \"genuine and substantial engagement\" with previous feedback and that the governance economics dimension is now \"meaningfully addressed.\" The 7.6/10 average reflects remaining gaps in analytical rigor, particularly the absent semi-formal model we promised.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Promised semi-formal coordination model not present**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this unfulfilled commitment. Our Round 1 rebuttal promised a \"semi-formal model\" that we did not deliver. We underestimated the complexity of formalizing the coordination problem in a way that would add analytical value beyond our discursive treatment.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Figure 2, a 2x2 game matrix as the reviewer suggests, illustrating the coordination problem. The matrix will show payoffs for Rollup A and B choosing between \"Stage 2\" and \"Remain Stage 1,\" with payoff structure reflecting: (a) mutual Stage 1 as Nash equilibrium due to competitive parity; (b) unilateral Stage 2 as dominated strategy due to user migration to lower-friction competitors; (c) mutual Stage 2 as Pareto-superior but unstable without coordination mechanism. We will include brief formal notation defining the payoff conditions under which coordination mechanisms (binding commitments, external requirements) shift the equilibrium. This is achievable within space constraints and directly addresses the reviewer's request.\n\n2. **Token governance failure analysis lacks theoretical grounding**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we describe symptoms without fully theorizing structural causes. We should connect our observations to established political economy literature.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 5.2.2 to explicitly engage with Olson's Logic of Collective Action, explaining how the free-rider problem applies to governance participation (individual token holders bear costs of becoming informed while benefits of good governance are diffuse), and how rational ignorance explains low participation rates even among sophisticated holders. We will also add analysis of delegation concentration as a selection effect: delegates who seek delegation tend to be those with interests in the protocol's operational decisions (development teams, large investors), creating systematic bias against decentralization pressure. These additions require approximately 400 words and substantially strengthen the theoretical foundation.\n\n3. **Missing empirical analysis of user behavior during security incidents**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that empirical grounding would strengthen our claims about market pressure insufficiency. While clean natural experiments are difficult, qualitative case analysis is feasible.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 5.5 presenting a case study of TVL and user behavior following the Optimism infinite money bug disclosure (February 2022). This incident is well-documented, occurred at a time when Optimism had meaningful TVL, and the bug was publicly disclosed with sufficient detail to assess severity. We will analyze: (a) TVL movements in the 30 days following disclosure compared to baseline and competing rollups; (b) governance forum discussions and user sentiment; (c) whether the incident produced measurable pressure toward decentralization (spoiler: it did not). We acknowledge this single case study cannot prove market pressure insufficiency but provides concrete evidence beyond assertion.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- We will add a brief discussion of why rational token holders might delegate to parties aligned with development teams, connecting to the literature on informed intermediaries in corporate governance.\n- The claim about users choosing lower-fee options will be qualified with available evidence (L2Beat fee comparisons and TVL rankings) while acknowledging that fee sensitivity cannot be cleanly isolated from other factors affecting rollup choice.\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Additions**:\n1. Expanded SHARP and Boojum prover architecture discussion with explicit trust implications and documentation limitations (Section 3.4)\n2. Table 3: Systematic security council intervention analysis with dates, types, response times, and Stage 2 compatibility assessment\n3. Section 3.5.1: Technical specifications for escape hatch mechanisms (Starknet frozen state, zkSync priority queue)\n4. Table 4: Bug taxonomy with 14 documented vulnerabilities, categorized by component, severity, discovery method, and resolution\n5. Figure 2: 2x2 coordination game matrix with formal payoff conditions\n6. Section 5.5: Empirical case study of user/TVL response to Optimism infinite money bug disclosure\n7. Theoretical grounding in Olson's collective action framework for token governance failure analysis\n\n**Revisions to Existing Content**:\n1. Verification coverage section revised to explicitly acknowledge data limitations and document what is known from public sources\n2. Audit ecosystem claims revised with citations to specific public audit reports or qualified as informal knowledge\n3. Stage 2 readiness audit requirements clarified as authors' proposed framework\n4. Timeline projections explicitly conditioned on verification milestones\n\n**Clarifications**:\n1. PLONK trusted setup vs. STARK transparency implications for upgrade processes\n2. Citation of Arbitrum's published Certora specifications\n3. Qualification of user fee sensitivity claims with available evidence\n\nWe believe these revisions address the substantive concerns raised by all three reviewers while remaining achievable within a reasonable revision timeline. We have been careful to commit only to additions we can deliver with appropriate rigor, learning from our Round 1 experience of overpromising. We thank the reviewers for their patience and continued engagement with our work.",

The most valuable improvement is the explicit acknowledgment that standardized verification coverage metrics are unavailable\u2014this intellectual honesty is preferable to false precision. However, the manuscript still falls short of the specific commitments made in the Round 2 rebuttal. The promised bug taxonomy table (Table 4) would have provided the empirical foundation necessary for credible timeline projections; its absence is a significant gap. The claim that 'we have compiled 14 incidents with sufficient public documentation' in the rebuttal suggests this data exists but was not included in the revision. Similarly, the commitment to cite Arbitrum's published Certora specifications with specific verified invariants was not fulfilled\u2014the manuscript still uses vague language like 'Partial Certora verification of specific invariants' without naming those invariants. The audit ecosystem section's claims about costs ($1-5M) and timelines (3-6 months) remain unsourced despite the rebuttal's commitment to cite specific public audit reports. For a manuscript arguing that formal verification gaps contribute to Stage 2 delays, the treatment of verification status should be more rigorous. I recommend the authors fulfill their stated commitments before the next revision, or explicitly explain why these deliverables could not be included.

The manuscript's treatment of these topics remains essentially unchanged from Round 2. From a rollup architecture and security engineering perspective, these omissions matter significantly: escape hatch functionality is the critical user protection distinguishing Stage 1 from Stage 0, and without technical specifications readers cannot assess whether these mechanisms would actually function under adversarial conditions. Similarly, the security council intervention analysis is essential for understanding the practical necessity of council powers and informing realistic Stage 2 timelines. The BOLD coverage is genuinely strong and the security council configuration table is useful, but the pattern of unfulfilled commitments undermines confidence in the manuscript's empirical foundation.

          "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain governance and decentralization economics perspective, this revision represents genuine progress toward publication quality. The authors have clearly internalized the critique that descriptive accounts of governance failures require theoretical grounding in established political economy literature. The commitment to integrate Olson's collective action framework is particularly valuable\u2014this canonical work explains precisely why diffuse stakeholders (token holders) systematically fail to organize against concentrated interests (development teams), even when aggregate stakes are enormous. The promised 2x2 game matrix addresses my core concern about the coordination failure analysis lacking formal specification. However, I must note that the manuscript text provided does not yet contain these promised additions\u2014the rebuttal describes what will be added, but the current Section 5 lacks both the game-theoretic formalization and the Olsonian theoretical apparatus. The empirical case study of the Optimism infinite money bug is an excellent choice: it represents a well-documented, high-severity incident with sufficient time elapsed to observe behavioral responses. The key analytical question is whether users exhibited any measurable response (TVL withdrawal, governance engagement, public pressure for decentralization) or whether the incident was absorbed without behavioral change\u2014the latter would strongly support the market pressure insufficiency thesis. One area requiring further development is the political economy of security councils themselves. The manuscript discusses council composition and sunset challenges but does not fully theorize why council members might resist obsolescence despite stated commitments to decentralization. Drawing on literature about regulatory capture and institutional persistence would strengthen this analysis. Similarly, the delegation concentration phenomenon deserves deeper treatment: why do rational token holders delegate to parties likely aligned with development teams? The answer involves information economics (delegates who seek delegation are those with private information about protocol operations) and creates a selection effect systematically biasing governance against decentralization pressure. If the authors deliver on their rebuttal commitments, this manuscript will merit strong publication consideration. The current score reflects confidence that the promised additions will materialize, but final assessment requires seeing the implemented changes.",
