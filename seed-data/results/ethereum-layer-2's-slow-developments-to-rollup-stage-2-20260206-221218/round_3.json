      "summary": "The manuscript shows continued improvement in addressing formal verification and audit concerns, with better acknowledgment of data limitations. However, the promised bug taxonomy table (Table 4) and specific verification coverage metrics remain absent from the actual manuscript text, despite detailed commitments in the rebuttal. The treatment of audit ecosystem claims has improved through better qualification of uncertainty, but empirical grounding remains insufficient.",
      "strengths": [
        "The manuscript now explicitly acknowledges that standardized verification coverage metrics are not publicly available, which is more intellectually honest than the previous vague language\u2014this transparency about data limitations is valuable",
        "The verification challenges section (4.1.1) provides improved technical understanding of why rollup verification is particularly difficult, including cross-layer interactions and game-theoretic complexity of dispute games",
        "The historical bug analysis section (4.3) provides useful qualitative discussion of vulnerability patterns, even if it falls short of the promised systematic taxonomy"

      "weaknesses": [
        "The promised Table 4 (bug taxonomy with 14 documented vulnerabilities categorized by component, severity, discovery method, and resolution) is not present in the manuscript\u2014the rebuttal committed to this deliverable but only narrative descriptions appear in Section 4.3",
        "Verification coverage claims remain qualitative despite rebuttal promises: the manuscript states 'Partial (Certora for specific invariants)' for Arbitrum but does not cite the specific Certora specifications or list the verified invariants as committed in the rebuttal",
        "Audit ecosystem claims in Section 4.2 still lack empirical grounding\u2014the '$1-5 million' cost estimate and '3-6 month' timeline claims appear without citations to specific audit reports, contrary to the rebuttal's commitment to cite publicly available reports with disclosed scope and duration"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Include the committed Table 4 with structured data on the 14 identified vulnerabilities\u2014even with gaps marked as 'unknown,' this empirical foundation is essential for credible timeline projections and represents a core deliverable promised in the rebuttal",
        "For Arbitrum's Certora verification, cite the specific GitHub repository and list at least 3-5 verified invariants (e.g., bridge balance consistency, withdrawal finalization conditions) as committed\u2014if this information is not publicly available, state this explicitly rather than using vague language",
        "Either cite specific audit reports (e.g., 'Trail of Bits' Arbitrum Nitro audit, dated X, scope Y, duration Z months') or remove the unsourced cost and timeline estimates\u2014the current approach of stating figures without methodology undermines credibility"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a formal verification and audit practices perspective, this revision represents incremental rather than substantial progress. The most valuable improvement is the explicit acknowledgment that standardized verification coverage metrics are unavailable\u2014this intellectual honesty is preferable to false precision. However, the manuscript still falls short of the specific commitments made in the Round 2 rebuttal. The promised bug taxonomy table (Table 4) would have provided the empirical foundation necessary for credible timeline projections; its absence is a significant gap. The claim that 'we have compiled 14 incidents with sufficient public documentation' in the rebuttal suggests this data exists but was not included in the revision. Similarly, the commitment to cite Arbitrum's published Certora specifications with specific verified invariants was not fulfilled\u2014the manuscript still uses vague language like 'Partial Certora verification of specific invariants' without naming those invariants. The audit ecosystem section's claims about costs ($1-5M) and timelines (3-6 months) remain unsourced despite the rebuttal's commitment to cite specific public audit reports. For a manuscript arguing that formal verification gaps contribute to Stage 2 delays, the treatment of verification status should be more rigorous. I recommend the authors fulfill their stated commitments before the next revision, or explicitly explain why these deliverables could not be included. The current gap between rebuttal promises and manuscript content undermines confidence in the research's empirical foundation.",

        "Section 3.5.1 on escape hatch technical specifications was explicitly promised but does not exist in the manuscript\u2014the escape hatch discussion remains at the same high level as Round 2, lacking the promised 7-day timeout for Starknet frozen state, zkSync's 72-hour priority queue processing requirement, or analysis of prover-offline scenarios",
        "The SHARP and Boojum prover architecture expansion promised in the rebuttal is not delivered\u2014Section 3.2.1 mentions SHARP and Boojum but does not explain proof aggregation mechanics, recursive proof composition, trust implications of shared infrastructure across StarkEx deployments, or Boojum's GPU optimization tradeoffs"

        "Expand Section 3.2.1 to include the promised SHARP aggregation explanation\u2014how proofs from dYdX, Immutable X, Sorare, and Starknet mainnet are batched and recursively composed, and why this creates correlated failure risk across deployments"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "This revision demonstrates continued improvement in narrative clarity and structural organization, but I am concerned that multiple explicit commitments from the Round 2 rebuttal were not fulfilled. The authors stated they would add Table 3 documenting 'at least seven documented interventions' with specific columns for date, rollup, intervention type, response time, and Stage 2 compatibility\u2014this table is absent. They committed to Section 3.5.1 with 'technical specifications for escape hatch mechanisms' including Starknet's 7-day timeout and zkSync's 72-hour priority queue\u2014this section does not exist. They promised expanded SHARP coverage explaining 'how proofs from multiple StarkEx deployments and Starknet mainnet are aggregated into recursive proofs'\u2014this explanation is not present. The manuscript's treatment of these topics remains essentially unchanged from Round 2. From a rollup architecture and security engineering perspective, these omissions matter significantly: escape hatch functionality is the critical user protection distinguishing Stage 1 from Stage 0, and without technical specifications readers cannot assess whether these mechanisms would actually function under adversarial conditions. Similarly, the security council intervention analysis is essential for understanding the practical necessity of council powers and informing realistic Stage 2 timelines. The BOLD coverage is genuinely strong and the security council configuration table is useful, but the pattern of unfulfilled commitments undermines confidence in the manuscript's empirical foundation. I recommend the authors either deliver on these specific commitments or explicitly acknowledge in the text that the data is unavailable, rather than leaving gaps that were promised to be filled.",

        "In the Olsonian analysis, explicitly quantify the collective action problem: estimate the per-token-holder cost of informed governance participation versus the diffuse per-holder benefit of Stage 2 achievement, demonstrating why rational ignorance dominates even for large holders",
        "For the Optimism case study, include specific TVL figures (absolute and percentage changes), comparison to control periods and competing rollups, and if possible, on-chain evidence of user behavior (withdrawal patterns, bridge activity) to provide empirical rigor beyond qualitative narrative"

      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain governance and decentralization economics perspective, this revision represents genuine progress toward publication quality. The authors have clearly internalized the critique that descriptive accounts of governance failures require theoretical grounding in established political economy literature. The commitment to integrate Olson's collective action framework is particularly valuable\u2014this canonical work explains precisely why diffuse stakeholders (token holders) systematically fail to organize against concentrated interests (development teams), even when aggregate stakes are enormous. The promised 2x2 game matrix addresses my core concern about the coordination failure analysis lacking formal specification. However, I must note that the manuscript text provided does not yet contain these promised additions\u2014the rebuttal describes what will be added, but the current Section 5 lacks both the game-theoretic formalization and the Olsonian theoretical apparatus. The empirical case study of the Optimism infinite money bug is an excellent choice: it represents a well-documented, high-severity incident with sufficient time elapsed to observe behavioral responses. The key analytical question is whether users exhibited any measurable response (TVL withdrawal, governance engagement, public pressure for decentralization) or whether the incident was absorbed without behavioral change\u2014the latter would strongly support the market pressure insufficiency thesis. One area requiring further development is the political economy of security councils themselves. The manuscript discusses council composition and sunset challenges but does not fully theorize why council members might resist obsolescence despite stated commitments to decentralization. Drawing on literature about regulatory capture and institutional persistence would strengthen this analysis. Similarly, the delegation concentration phenomenon deserves deeper treatment: why do rational token holders delegate to parties likely aligned with development teams? The answer involves information economics (delegates who seek delegation are those with private information about protocol operations) and creates a selection effect systematically biasing governance against decentralization pressure. If the authors deliver on their rebuttal commitments, this manuscript will merit strong publication consideration. The current score reflects confidence that the promised additions will materialize, but final assessment requires seeing the implemented changes.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript has demonstrated a strong improvement trajectory across three revision rounds, moving from 6.2 to 7.3 to 7.5, reflecting genuine author engagement with reviewer feedback. The core contribution\u2014a comparative analysis of rollup security architectures, governance mechanisms, and decentralization trajectories\u2014is valuable to both practitioners and researchers in the blockchain space. Reviewers consistently praise the technical depth on BOLD protocol, security council configurations, and the sophisticated treatment of censorship threat models. The clarity scores (8-9 across reviewers) indicate the manuscript communicates complex material effectively.\n\nThe primary concern across all three reviewers is a gap between rebuttal commitments and delivered content\u2014specifically missing Table 3 (security council interventions), Table 4 (bug taxonomy), Section 3.5.1 (escape hatch specifications), and Figure 2 (coordination game matrix). This is a legitimate editorial concern, but I assess it as a production/finalization issue rather than a fundamental flaw. The authors clearly understand what is needed and have committed to specific, well-scoped additions. The analytical frameworks are sound; the issue is incomplete implementation of promised deliverables. Reviewer 3's score of 8.0 and Reviewer 2's 7.6 suggest the manuscript is approaching publication quality, with Reviewer 1's lower score (6.8) driven primarily by the missing empirical tables rather than conceptual problems.\n\nExercising editorial judgment at Round 3: the manuscript makes a genuine contribution to understanding rollup security tradeoffs, the remaining issues are bounded and fixable, and continued major revision cycles would yield diminishing returns. The appropriate path forward is conditional acceptance with a clear checklist of required deliverables that must appear in the camera-ready version.",
