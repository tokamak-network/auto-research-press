The paper should examine how MEV-boost and builder centralization affect based rollup transaction inclusion in practice. On confirmation times, the analysis conflates soft confirmations, L1 inclusion, and finality without clearly delineating the security guarantees at each stage. A centralized sequencer provides instant soft confirmations with weaker guarantees, while based rollups provide slower confirmations with stronger guarantees\u2014but the paper doesn't formalize what 'stronger' means here or quantify the trade-off. The preconfirmation section is the strongest contribution, but it would benefit from analyzing the trust assumptions introduced by preconfirmation mechanisms\u2014are they truly 'no additional trust assumptions' if they require new slashing conditions and commitment infrastructure? Finally, the composability discussion mentions atomic cross-rollup transactions but doesn't address the fundamental challenge that even with shared L1 sequencing, achieving atomicity across rollups with different state transition functions requires additional coordination mechanisms not present in the current based rollup design.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From an MEV economics and PBS perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening. The most glaring omission is the failure to adequately address how Proposer-Builder Separation fundamentally changes the based rollup MEV landscape. In Ethereum's current PBS regime, builders\u2014not proposers\u2014construct blocks and determine transaction ordering. This means L2 batch inclusion and ordering is actually controlled by builders who bid for block space. The manuscript's repeated references to 'L1 proposers' controlling sequencing is technically imprecise post-PBS. This has profound implications: builders can extract cross-domain MEV by atomically including L1 and L2 transactions, creating new MEV extraction patterns not possible with centralized L2 sequencers. The paper should analyze builder competition dynamics for L2 MEV, including whether we expect builder specialization for based rollup MEV extraction.\n\nThe revenue model discussion is particularly weak. The assertion that Taiko's 'ticket-based system where proposers purchase the right to propose blocks' creates sustainable economics needs rigorous analysis. What is the expected ticket price equilibrium? How does this compare to MEV extracted? The paper claims based rollups may have lower fees due to reduced operational overhead, but provides no quantitative framework. A proper analysis would model: (1) MEV extracted from L2 transactions, (2) portion capturable through various mechanisms (MEV-Share, order flow auctions), (3) operational cost comparison with centralized sequencers, and (4) sustainable fee structures.\n\nThe preconfirmation economics also deserve deeper treatment. Preconfirmations in a PBS context raise complex questions: If builders control block construction, how can proposers credibly commit to inclusion? The paper mentions slashing but doesn't analyze the economic parameters required for credible commitments. What collateral is needed? How does this interact with builder payments? The mev-commit and Commit-Boost references are appropriate but the economic analysis of these systems is absent.\n\nFinally, the cross-domain MEV analysis is missing entirely. Based rollups create unique MEV patterns: L1-L2 arbitrage, cross-rollup MEV (if multiple based rollups exist), and new forms of sandwich attacks spanning domains. These patterns differ structurally from centralized sequencer MEV and deserve dedicated analysis.",

          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From a data availability and security modeling perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening. The treatment of EIP-4844 integration is particularly concerning - the paper states blobs provide '~10x cost reduction' without analyzing the fundamental architectural implications. Based rollups posting to blobs face unique challenges: blob data expires after ~18 days, meaning historical state reconstruction requires either archival nodes or alternative DA solutions. The paper should address how based rollups handle this, whether through blob archival services, state snapshots, or hybrid approaches. Furthermore, the interaction between blob gas pricing (which operates on a separate fee market) and based rollup economics deserves analysis - during periods of high blob demand, based rollups compete with other rollups for blob space, potentially creating confirmation delays beyond the 12-second block time.\n\nThe security analysis in Section 3 lacks the rigor expected for a comprehensive technical analysis. The intersection formulation presented is not meaningful without defining what 'security' means in each context. A proper treatment would distinguish: (1) DA security - the guarantee that posted data remains available for the challenge period, (2) sequencing security - the guarantee that valid transactions are eventually included, (3) execution security - the guarantee that only valid state transitions are finalized. Each has different trust assumptions and failure modes. For instance, the paper claims based rollups inherit L1 censorship resistance, but this requires careful qualification - while L1 proposer rotation provides probabilistic inclusion guarantees, the paper doesn't analyze how MEV-driven transaction ordering might create de facto censorship for certain transaction types (e.g., DEX trades that become unprofitable after reordering).\n\nThe fraud proof discussion is notably absent despite being critical to based optimistic rollups. In L1-sequenced contexts, the derivation pipeline that converts L1 data into L2 state becomes a critical security component. If there's ambiguity in derivation rules, different nodes might derive different states from the same L1 data, creating consensus failures. The paper should address how based rollups specify canonical derivation and how this interacts with fraud proof mechanisms. Additionally, L1 reorgs present unique challenges - if a fraud proof references L1 data that gets reorged, the proof may become invalid, requiring careful design of challenge windows relative to L1 finality.",

The core insight that MEV flows to the builder-proposer supply chain rather than 'to L1' is valuable and correctly articulated. However, the analysis of builder specialization and its implications deserves much deeper treatment. The observation that 'L2-capable builders' may concentrate the market is critical\u2014if based rollup MEV extraction requires specialized infrastructure, we could see a scenario where 2-3 vertically-integrated searcher-builders dominate based rollup sequencing, which would undermine the decentralization benefits. The paper should model this concentration risk explicitly.\n\nThe preconfirmation economics section, while promising, is incomplete and oversimplified. The minimum fee calculation assumes independent preconfirmations, but in practice, preconfirmation providers face correlated risks across multiple commitments. More importantly, the fundamental PBS tension isn't resolved: if a proposer preconfirms a transaction but their chosen builder doesn't include it, who is slashed? The paper mentions 'proposer-builder coordination' but doesn't specify mechanisms. Research on inclusion lists (EIP-7547) and their interaction with preconfirmations should be referenced.\n\nThe MEV recapture mechanisms section is useful but lacks comparative analysis. How does Taiko's ticket system perform empirically? What percentage of theoretical MEV is actually recaptured? The claim that based rollups 'sacrifice ~$40,000/day' needs validation against actual protocol data. Additionally, the cross-domain MEV analysis should address timing games\u2014builders may strategically delay based rollup batch inclusion to maximize L1-L2 arbitrage opportunities, creating systematic latency beyond the 12-second baseline.",

The identification that builders control ordering (not proposers) is crucial and correctly analyzed. However, the manuscript undersells one of the most significant architectural advantages of based rollups: synchronous composability with L1. Unlike centralized sequencers where L2 state is temporally decoupled from L1, based rollups can enable atomic transactions that read and write both L1 and L2 state within a single block. This enables use cases like atomic L1-L2 arbitrage, synchronized oracle updates, and unified liquidity positions that are architecturally impossible with other sequencing models. The liveness analysis, while mathematically sound, needs to address the practical concern of blob space competition more rigorously. During the March 2024 blobscription event, blob fees spiked 100x and inclusion delays extended significantly\u2014the manuscript should analyze how based rollups perform under such stress conditions and whether the probabilistic guarantees degrade gracefully.

Finally, the comparison table in Section 2.3 should be expanded to include shared sequencing models (Espresso, Astria) as a third comparison point, since practitioners are often choosing between all three architectures rather than just centralized vs. based.",

The blob gas market analysis is accurate and the empirical data from Taiko is valuable. However, several critical gaps exist. First, the treatment of fraud proofs in Section 2.5.1 is superficial - in a based context, the fraud proof must prove not just incorrect execution but incorrect derivation, which fundamentally changes the bisection game structure. The manuscript mentions this but doesn't analyze the implications: derivation disputes may require proving L1 state access patterns, which is computationally distinct from execution disputes. Second, the security inheritance model is presented too optimistically. While the manuscript correctly notes builder concentration, it doesn't adequately address that relay-level filtering (OFAC compliance) creates a censorship layer that doesn't exist in the idealized model. The probabilistic censorship resistance calculation assumes builders are independent actors, but in practice, relay policies create correlated censorship behavior. Third, the post-blob-expiry security model deserves more rigorous treatment. The manuscript correctly identifies the problem but doesn't formalize the trust assumptions: relying on archival services is functionally similar to a data availability committee, and this should be explicitly compared. What are the liveness and safety guarantees if the top 3 archival services fail? Finally, for ZK-based rollups, the manuscript doesn't address the complexity of proving derivation correctness. Proving that transactions were correctly derived from L1 blobs requires either (a) the ZK proof to include L1 state verification, significantly increasing proof complexity, or (b) a trusted derivation assumption, which weakens the security model. This is a fundamental architectural consideration that's missing from the analysis.",

However, the manuscript's greatest gap is the absence of revenue model analysis. Based rollups fundamentally change the MEV supply chain: instead of a centralized sequencer capturing ordering value, this value flows to the L1 builder/proposer pipeline. The manuscript should quantify this: What is the expected MEV from a based rollup batch? How does this compare to centralized sequencer revenue? Can based rollups implement MEV-sharing mechanisms to recapture some of this value? The Taiko BCR model is mentioned but its economic implications aren't analyzed. Similarly, the synchronous composability section correctly identifies unique MEV opportunities but doesn't estimate their magnitude or analyze the competitive dynamics. If atomic L1-L2 arbitrage is possible, sophisticated searchers will compete for this value - how does this competition affect builder selection, and does it create centralizing pressure toward builders with the best L2 integration? The manuscript also needs to address the 'builder infrastructure problem': to extract L2 MEV, builders need to run L2 nodes and integrate L2 transaction flow. This creates barriers to entry that may concentrate the builder market further.

The comparison framework in Section 2.3 correctly identifies the fundamental distinction between soft and hard confirmations - a nuance often overlooked in practitioner discussions. The treatment of synchronous L1 composability in Section 2.4 is particularly valuable, as this architectural advantage is frequently underappreciated; the concrete examples of atomic cross-layer execution patterns provide actionable insights for protocol designers.\n\nHowever, the paper's treatment of confirmation time trade-offs - a core focus area for this review - is insufficiently developed. The executive summary mentions preconfirmations as potentially 'eliminating the primary competitive disadvantage' but the body text provides no substantive analysis. Given that based preconfirmations (via mechanisms like EigenLayer restaking or proposer commitments) fundamentally alter the latency/trust trade-off, this omission is significant. A rigorous analysis should address: (1) the cryptoeconomic security of preconfirmation commitments, (2) the slashing conditions and their sufficiency, (3) how preconfirmation latency compares to centralized sequencer soft confirmations under various network conditions, and (4) the composability implications when some transactions have preconfirmations and others don't.\n\nThe liveness analysis in Section 3.1.2 is commendable for incorporating empirical data, but the formal model needs refinement. The probability calculation assumes builder selection is independent across blocks, but under PBS with proposer-builder separation, the same builder may win consecutive blocks with non-trivial probability. Additionally, the blob congestion analysis should consider adversarial scenarios where a well-funded attacker deliberately saturates blob space to degrade based rollup liveness - what is the cost of such an attack and how does it compare to attacking centralized sequencer infrastructure?\n\nThe censorship resistance analysis in Section 3.1.3 appropriately adjusts for builder concentration and relay filtering, providing a more realistic assessment than naive models. However, the comparison table would benefit from including the emerging 'inclusion list' mechanism (EIP-7547) which could significantly improve based rollup censorship resistance by allowing proposers to mandate transaction inclusion regardless of builder preferences.\n\nFinally, the truncation of Section 3.2.1 is unfortunate as the builder concentration dynamics appear to be heading toward important conclusions about market structure evolution. The incomplete equation suggests a threshold analysis that would be valuable for understanding when based rollup MEV extraction leads to further builder concentration versus when it might actually improve decentralization by creating new competitive dimensions.",

          "Nuanced and rigorous treatment of builder concentration effects on censorship resistance, correctly challenging naive 'L1-equivalent security' assumptions with formal analysis of correlated builder behavior",
          "Comprehensive decomposition of sequencing models with clear articulation of synchronous L1 composability as a qualitatively distinct architectural advantage enabling atomic cross-domain operations"
        ],
        "key_weaknesses": [
          "Absence of quantitative economic analysis addressing based rollup revenue sustainability, MEV capture rates, and comparison with centralized sequencer models",
          "Incomplete security parameter formalization, particularly the interaction between fraud proof challenge periods, blob retention windows, and L1 finality guarantees including edge cases",
          "Truncated manuscript with inadequate treatment of preconfirmation mechanisms and their security/latency trade-offs despite their centrality to addressing based rollup latency limitations"
        ],
        "required_changes": [
          "Complete all truncated sections and add dedicated analysis of preconfirmation mechanisms including trust assumptions, security properties, and PBS interactions",
          "Add quantitative economic analysis section covering revenue sources, MEV-sharing arrangements, and sustainability comparison with centralized sequencer models",
          "Formalize security parameter relationships with explicit treatment of how fraud proof windows, blob retention, and L1 finality interact, including the data availability withholding attack vector",
          "Expand cross-domain MEV analysis with formal treatment of searcher-builder dynamics and empirical data on observed extraction patterns"
        ],
        "recommendation": "The manuscript represents strong technical work that is close to publication-ready. Authors should focus revision efforts on three priorities: (1) completing the truncated sections, particularly preconfirmation analysis; (2) adding a dedicated economics section with quantitative sustainability analysis; and (3) formalizing the security parameter relationships identified by Reviewer 1. The cross-domain MEV expansion is important but secondary. These additions should be achievable within a focused revision cycle without requiring fundamental restructuring of the existing strong technical foundation.",
