      "detailed_feedback": "From a data availability and security models perspective, this manuscript demonstrates strong foundational understanding but has gaps in formal security analysis. The blob expiry treatment in \u00a72.5.3 is commendable\u2014the distinction between DAC attestation trust and archival service verifiability is technically precise and important. However, the security inheritance claims need more rigorous treatment. The manuscript states based rollups inherit 'Ethereum's battle-tested decentralization' but doesn't formally specify what security properties transfer and under what assumptions. For instance, L1 provides probabilistic finality after 2 epochs, but economic finality (resistance to reversion given slashing costs) is a separate guarantee\u2014the manuscript conflates these. For fraud proofs specifically, the modified bisection protocol in \u00a72.6.1 is a valuable contribution, but it doesn't address a critical attack vector: what happens if the L1 data referenced in the fraud proof becomes unavailable (post-blob-expiry) during the interactive dispute? The protocol should specify fallback mechanisms or require disputes to complete within the retention window. The DAS discussion is notably thin given its importance\u2014under DAS, the guarantee changes from 'I can download this data' to 'the network collectively verified availability at publication time,' which has profound implications for fraud proof systems that may need to retrieve data days after publication. Finally, the empirical data from Taiko is valuable but would benefit from confidence intervals and discussion of potential selection bias in the observation period.",

        "The revenue model analysis is conspicuously absent - the manuscript mentions that 'MEV flows to builders/proposers' but provides no quantitative analysis of how based rollups sustain themselves economically without sequencer fees, what the expected MEV capture rates are, or how this compares to centralized sequencer revenue",
        "Cross-domain MEV extraction patterns are mentioned but not rigorously analyzed - the manuscript lacks treatment of searcher-builder dynamics specific to based rollups, including how searchers submit cross-domain bundles, builder integration requirements, and the competitive dynamics between L1-only and L2-aware searchers",
        "The PBS interaction analysis is incomplete - while builder concentration is discussed, the manuscript doesn't adequately address how MEV-Boost auction dynamics change with based rollup batches, whether builders can extract L2 MEV without running full L2 nodes, or the implications of builder-proposer payment flows for rollup economics"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated section on based rollup economics covering: (1) revenue sources (batch fees, MEV sharing arrangements, protocol fees), (2) quantitative comparison with centralized sequencer revenue models, (3) sustainability analysis under various MEV extraction scenarios, and (4) potential MEV-sharing mechanisms like MEV-Share or SUAVE integration",
        "Develop the cross-domain MEV analysis with formal treatment of: searcher bundle construction for atomic L1-L2 extraction, builder infrastructure requirements for L2-aware block building, expected MEV values from synchronous composability, and empirical data from Taiko on observed cross-domain extraction patterns",
        "Expand PBS interaction analysis to cover: how based rollup batches affect MEV-Boost bid values, whether proposers can extract additional value through timing games with L2 batches, the role of block builder APIs in L2 transaction submission, and potential conflicts between L1 and L2 MEV optimization"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From an MEV economics perspective, this manuscript correctly identifies several key dynamics but stops short of the rigorous analysis needed for practitioners evaluating based rollup economics. The treatment of builder concentration is commendable - the acknowledgment that 3 builders control ~70% of blocks and the implications for censorship resistance represents honest analysis often missing from based rollup advocacy. However, the manuscript's greatest gap is the absence of revenue model analysis. Based rollups fundamentally change the MEV supply chain: instead of a centralized sequencer capturing ordering value, this value flows to the L1 builder/proposer pipeline. The manuscript should quantify this: What is the expected MEV from a based rollup batch? How does this compare to centralized sequencer revenue? Can based rollups implement MEV-sharing mechanisms to recapture some of this value? The Taiko BCR model is mentioned but its economic implications aren't analyzed. Similarly, the synchronous composability section correctly identifies unique MEV opportunities but doesn't estimate their magnitude or analyze the competitive dynamics. If atomic L1-L2 arbitrage is possible, sophisticated searchers will compete for this value - how does this competition affect builder selection, and does it create centralizing pressure toward builders with the best L2 integration? The manuscript also needs to address the 'builder infrastructure problem': to extract L2 MEV, builders need to run L2 nodes and integrate L2 transaction flow. This creates barriers to entry that may concentrate the builder market further. Finally, the interaction between based rollup batches and MEV-Boost auctions deserves formal treatment - do batches increase bid values? Can proposers extract additional value through strategic batch timing? These questions are central to understanding based rollup economics under PBS.",

        "Complete the truncated sections and add dedicated analysis of preconfirmation mechanisms (e.g., based preconfirmations via restaking, inclusion lists) including their confirmation time improvements, new trust assumptions, and how they interact with PBS",
        "Formalize the confirmation time trade-off analysis with a model that captures the spectrum from soft confirmations (~100ms, sequencer trust) through preconfirmations (~100ms-1s, preconfer trust) to hard confirmations (12s, L1 trust), quantifying the security/latency Pareto frontier",
        "Expand the multi-rollup blob competition analysis with game-theoretic modeling - when N based rollups compete for M blob slots, what are the equilibrium inclusion delays and fee dynamics? This is critical for assessing based rollup scalability"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a Layer 2 sequencing and rollup architecture perspective, this manuscript demonstrates strong domain knowledge and provides valuable contributions to the based rollup literature. The comparison framework in Section 2.3 correctly identifies the fundamental distinction between soft and hard confirmations - a nuance often overlooked in practitioner discussions. The treatment of synchronous L1 composability in Section 2.4 is particularly valuable, as this architectural advantage is frequently underappreciated; the concrete examples of atomic cross-layer execution patterns provide actionable insights for protocol designers.\n\nHowever, the paper's treatment of confirmation time trade-offs - a core focus area for this review - is insufficiently developed. The executive summary mentions preconfirmations as potentially 'eliminating the primary competitive disadvantage' but the body text provides no substantive analysis. Given that based preconfirmations (via mechanisms like EigenLayer restaking or proposer commitments) fundamentally alter the latency/trust trade-off, this omission is significant. A rigorous analysis should address: (1) the cryptoeconomic security of preconfirmation commitments, (2) the slashing conditions and their sufficiency, (3) how preconfirmation latency compares to centralized sequencer soft confirmations under various network conditions, and (4) the composability implications when some transactions have preconfirmations and others don't.\n\nThe liveness analysis in Section 3.1.2 is commendable for incorporating empirical data, but the formal model needs refinement. The probability calculation assumes builder selection is independent across blocks, but under PBS with proposer-builder separation, the same builder may win consecutive blocks with non-trivial probability. Additionally, the blob congestion analysis should consider adversarial scenarios where a well-funded attacker deliberately saturates blob space to degrade based rollup liveness - what is the cost of such an attack and how does it compare to attacking centralized sequencer infrastructure?\n\nThe censorship resistance analysis in Section 3.1.3 appropriately adjusts for builder concentration and relay filtering, providing a more realistic assessment than naive models. However, the comparison table would benefit from including the emerging 'inclusion list' mechanism (EIP-7547) which could significantly improve based rollup censorship resistance by allowing proposers to mandate transaction inclusion regardless of builder preferences.\n\nFinally, the truncation of Section 3.2.1 is unfortunate as the builder concentration dynamics appear to be heading toward important conclusions about market structure evolution. The incomplete equation suggests a threshold analysis that would be valuable for understanding when based rollup MEV extraction leads to further builder concentration versus when it might actually improve decentralization by creating new competitive dimensions.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript provides a technically solid and comprehensive analysis of based rollups, demonstrating strong understanding of the architectural trade-offs between sequencing models, data availability mechanisms, and security inheritance properties. All three reviewers converge on recognizing the paper's strengths in empirical grounding (Taiko mainnet data), nuanced treatment of builder concentration and censorship resistance, and rigorous analysis of synchronous L1 composability benefits. The formal treatment of derivation pipelines and fraud proof mechanisms represents genuine contribution to the literature.\n\nHowever, significant gaps remain that prevent immediate acceptance. Most critically, Reviewer 2 identifies the absence of quantitative economic analysis\u2014a fundamental omission given that based rollups' viability depends on sustainable revenue models without centralized sequencer fees. Reviewer 1 raises valid concerns about incomplete security parameter analysis, particularly the interaction between fraud proof windows, blob retention, and L1 finality. Reviewer 3 notes the manuscript appears truncated mid-section, leaving preconfirmation mechanisms inadequately addressed despite their importance to the latency trade-off discussion. The cross-domain MEV analysis, while conceptually introduced, lacks the formal rigor expected at this venue.\n\nGiven this is the final review round and the average score of 7.2 reflects a paper with strong foundations but identifiable gaps, minor revision is appropriate. The core technical contributions are sound, and the required additions are well-scoped extensions rather than fundamental restructuring. The authors should prioritize completing truncated sections, adding the economic sustainability analysis, and formalizing the security parameter relationships.",
