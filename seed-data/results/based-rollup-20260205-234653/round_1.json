However, it reads more as an educational survey than original research, lacking rigorous formal analysis of the liveness guarantees and confirmation time trade-offs that distinguish based rollups from alternatives.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The liveness analysis is superficial\u2014claims that based rollups inherit L1 liveness without examining edge cases like proposer-builder separation dynamics, MEV-boost relay failures, or scenarios where L1 congestion affects L2 batch inclusion priority",
        "Confirmation time trade-offs lack quantitative rigor: the ~12s figure ignores probabilistic finality considerations, reorg risks during the 2-epoch finality window, and how these compare to centralized sequencer soft confirmations with force-inclusion fallbacks",
        "The security formalization 'Security(Based Rollup) = Security(Ethereum L1) \u2229 Security(Proof System)' is mathematically imprecise and glosses over important nuances like the distinction between sequencing liveness and execution validity"

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a Layer 2 sequencing and rollup architecture perspective, this manuscript correctly identifies the fundamental trade-offs but lacks the analytical depth expected for a research contribution. The comparison of sequencing models is accurate but surface-level\u2014for instance, the claim that based rollups provide 'L1-equivalent censorship resistance' deserves scrutiny given that L2 transactions must compete for blockspace with L1 transactions and may face different inclusion dynamics through the PBS pipeline. The paper should examine how MEV-boost and builder centralization affect based rollup transaction inclusion in practice. On confirmation times, the analysis conflates soft confirmations, L1 inclusion, and finality without clearly delineating the security guarantees at each stage. A centralized sequencer provides instant soft confirmations with weaker guarantees, while based rollups provide slower confirmations with stronger guarantees\u2014but the paper doesn't formalize what 'stronger' means here or quantify the trade-off. The preconfirmation section is the strongest contribution, but it would benefit from analyzing the trust assumptions introduced by preconfirmation mechanisms\u2014are they truly 'no additional trust assumptions' if they require new slashing conditions and commitment infrastructure? Finally, the composability discussion mentions atomic cross-rollup transactions but doesn't address the fundamental challenge that even with shared L1 sequencing, achieving atomicity across rollups with different state transition functions requires additional coordination mechanisms not present in the current based rollup design.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From an MEV economics and PBS perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening. The most glaring omission is the failure to adequately address how Proposer-Builder Separation fundamentally changes the based rollup MEV landscape. In Ethereum's current PBS regime, builders\u2014not proposers\u2014construct blocks and determine transaction ordering. This means L2 batch inclusion and ordering is actually controlled by builders who bid for block space. The manuscript's repeated references to 'L1 proposers' controlling sequencing is technically imprecise post-PBS. This has profound implications: builders can extract cross-domain MEV by atomically including L1 and L2 transactions, creating new MEV extraction patterns not possible with centralized L2 sequencers. The paper should analyze builder competition dynamics for L2 MEV, including whether we expect builder specialization for based rollup MEV extraction.\n\nThe revenue model discussion is particularly weak. The assertion that Taiko's 'ticket-based system where proposers purchase the right to propose blocks' creates sustainable economics needs rigorous analysis. What is the expected ticket price equilibrium? How does this compare to MEV extracted? The paper claims based rollups may have lower fees due to reduced operational overhead, but provides no quantitative framework. A proper analysis would model: (1) MEV extracted from L2 transactions, (2) portion capturable through various mechanisms (MEV-Share, order flow auctions), (3) operational cost comparison with centralized sequencers, and (4) sustainable fee structures.\n\nThe preconfirmation economics also deserve deeper treatment. Preconfirmations in a PBS context raise complex questions: If builders control block construction, how can proposers credibly commit to inclusion? The paper mentions slashing but doesn't analyze the economic parameters required for credible commitments. What collateral is needed? How does this interact with builder payments? The mev-commit and Commit-Boost references are appropriate but the economic analysis of these systems is absent.\n\nFinally, the cross-domain MEV analysis is missing entirely. Based rollups create unique MEV patterns: L1-L2 arbitrage, cross-rollup MEV (if multiple based rollups exist), and new forms of sandwich attacks spanning domains. These patterns differ structurally from centralized sequencer MEV and deserve dedicated analysis.",

        "Section 2.3 on Data Availability is severely underdeveloped - it merely lists options without analyzing how based rollups specifically interact with blob transactions, the implications of blob expiry (4096 epochs), or how state reconstruction works when historical blobs are pruned",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a data availability and security modeling perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening. The treatment of EIP-4844 integration is particularly concerning - the paper states blobs provide '~10x cost reduction' without analyzing the fundamental architectural implications. Based rollups posting to blobs face unique challenges: blob data expires after ~18 days, meaning historical state reconstruction requires either archival nodes or alternative DA solutions. The paper should address how based rollups handle this, whether through blob archival services, state snapshots, or hybrid approaches. Furthermore, the interaction between blob gas pricing (which operates on a separate fee market) and based rollup economics deserves analysis - during periods of high blob demand, based rollups compete with other rollups for blob space, potentially creating confirmation delays beyond the 12-second block time.\n\nThe security analysis in Section 3 lacks the rigor expected for a comprehensive technical analysis. The intersection formulation presented is not meaningful without defining what 'security' means in each context. A proper treatment would distinguish: (1) DA security - the guarantee that posted data remains available for the challenge period, (2) sequencing security - the guarantee that valid transactions are eventually included, (3) execution security - the guarantee that only valid state transitions are finalized. Each has different trust assumptions and failure modes. For instance, the paper claims based rollups inherit L1 censorship resistance, but this requires careful qualification - while L1 proposer rotation provides probabilistic inclusion guarantees, the paper doesn't analyze how MEV-driven transaction ordering might create de facto censorship for certain transaction types (e.g., DEX trades that become unprofitable after reordering).\n\nThe fraud proof discussion is notably absent despite being critical to based optimistic rollups. In L1-sequenced contexts, the derivation pipeline that converts L1 data into L2 state becomes a critical security component. If there's ambiguity in derivation rules, different nodes might derive different states from the same L1 data, creating consensus failures. The paper should address how based rollups specify canonical derivation and how this interacts with fraud proof mechanisms. Additionally, L1 reorgs present unique challenges - if a fraud proof references L1 data that gets reorged, the proof may become invalid, requiring careful design of challenge windows relative to L1 finality.",

    "meta_review": "The three reviewers converge on a consistent assessment: this manuscript provides a well-structured, clearly written overview of based rollup architecture that succeeds as educational material but falls short of the analytical rigor expected for original research contribution. All reviewers praised the clarity of exposition (scores of 8-9/10), the comprehensive coverage of the preconfirmation landscape, and the practical grounding through the Taiko case study. The comparative tables and architectural diagrams effectively communicate the fundamental trade-offs between sequencing models.\n\nHowever, all three reviewers independently identified critical gaps in technical depth across their respective domains. Reviewer 1 notes the liveness analysis lacks formal treatment of adversarial conditions and PBS dynamics. Reviewer 2 highlights that MEV economics are superficially addressed, with no quantitative modeling of builder incentives or revenue sustainability. Reviewer 3 points out that the data availability section is severely underdeveloped, and the security formalization ('Security(Based Rollup) = Security(Ethereum L1) \u2229 Security(Proof System)') is mathematically imprecise\u2014a concern echoed by Reviewer 1. The novelty scores (5/10 across all reviewers) and rigor scores (5-6/10) indicate the manuscript currently reads as a survey rather than a research contribution with original analytical insights.\n\nThe good news is that these deficiencies are addressable through substantive revision. The foundation is solid\u2014the authors clearly understand the architecture and have organized the material well. What's needed is elevation from descriptive overview to rigorous analysis: formal threat modeling, quantitative economic analysis, and deeper technical treatment of DA mechanisms and proof system interactions.",
