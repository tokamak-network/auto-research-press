However, the analysis lacks depth on emerging cross-domain MEV patterns, underestimates builder concentration risks, and the preconfirmation economics section requires more rigorous game-theoretic treatment.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From an MEV economics perspective, this manuscript makes important contributions but has notable gaps. The core insight that MEV flows to the builder-proposer supply chain rather than 'to L1' is valuable and correctly articulated. However, the analysis of builder specialization and its implications deserves much deeper treatment. The observation that 'L2-capable builders' may concentrate the market is critical\u2014if based rollup MEV extraction requires specialized infrastructure, we could see a scenario where 2-3 vertically-integrated searcher-builders dominate based rollup sequencing, which would undermine the decentralization benefits. The paper should model this concentration risk explicitly.\n\nThe preconfirmation economics section, while promising, is incomplete and oversimplified. The minimum fee calculation assumes independent preconfirmations, but in practice, preconfirmation providers face correlated risks across multiple commitments. More importantly, the fundamental PBS tension isn't resolved: if a proposer preconfirms a transaction but their chosen builder doesn't include it, who is slashed? The paper mentions 'proposer-builder coordination' but doesn't specify mechanisms. Research on inclusion lists (EIP-7547) and their interaction with preconfirmations should be referenced.\n\nThe MEV recapture mechanisms section is useful but lacks comparative analysis. How does Taiko's ticket system perform empirically? What percentage of theoretical MEV is actually recaptured? The claim that based rollups 'sacrifice ~$40,000/day' needs validation against actual protocol data. Additionally, the cross-domain MEV analysis should address timing games\u2014builders may strategically delay based rollup batch inclusion to maximize L1-L2 arbitrage opportunities, creating systematic latency beyond the 12-second baseline.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a Layer 2 sequencing and rollup architecture perspective, this manuscript makes valuable contributions to understanding based rollups, particularly in its treatment of the PBS-sequencing interaction. The identification that builders control ordering (not proposers) is crucial and correctly analyzed. However, the manuscript undersells one of the most significant architectural advantages of based rollups: synchronous composability with L1. Unlike centralized sequencers where L2 state is temporally decoupled from L1, based rollups can enable atomic transactions that read and write both L1 and L2 state within a single block. This enables use cases like atomic L1-L2 arbitrage, synchronized oracle updates, and unified liquidity positions that are architecturally impossible with other sequencing models. The liveness analysis, while mathematically sound, needs to address the practical concern of blob space competition more rigorously. During the March 2024 blobscription event, blob fees spiked 100x and inclusion delays extended significantly\u2014the manuscript should analyze how based rollups perform under such stress conditions and whether the probabilistic guarantees degrade gracefully. The preconfirmation economics section raises important points about collateral requirements but doesn't fully explore the emerging proposer commitment schemes (like those proposed in EIP-7547) that could provide a middle ground between full preconfirmations and standard L1 inclusion. Finally, the comparison table in Section 2.3 should be expanded to include shared sequencing models (Espresso, Astria) as a third comparison point, since practitioners are often choosing between all three architectures rather than just centralized vs. based.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a data availability and security models perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of EIP-4844 mechanics but falls short in rigorously analyzing the security implications. The blob gas market analysis is accurate and the empirical data from Taiko is valuable. However, several critical gaps exist. First, the treatment of fraud proofs in Section 2.5.1 is superficial - in a based context, the fraud proof must prove not just incorrect execution but incorrect derivation, which fundamentally changes the bisection game structure. The manuscript mentions this but doesn't analyze the implications: derivation disputes may require proving L1 state access patterns, which is computationally distinct from execution disputes. Second, the security inheritance model is presented too optimistically. While the manuscript correctly notes builder concentration, it doesn't adequately address that relay-level filtering (OFAC compliance) creates a censorship layer that doesn't exist in the idealized model. The probabilistic censorship resistance calculation assumes builders are independent actors, but in practice, relay policies create correlated censorship behavior. Third, the post-blob-expiry security model deserves more rigorous treatment. The manuscript correctly identifies the problem but doesn't formalize the trust assumptions: relying on archival services is functionally similar to a data availability committee, and this should be explicitly compared. What are the liveness and safety guarantees if the top 3 archival services fail? Finally, for ZK-based rollups, the manuscript doesn't address the complexity of proving derivation correctness. Proving that transactions were correctly derived from L1 blobs requires either (a) the ZK proof to include L1 state verification, significantly increasing proof complexity, or (b) a trusted derivation assumption, which weakens the security model. This is a fundamental architectural consideration that's missing from the analysis.",

All three reviewers converge on similar scores (7.2/10 average) and identify consistent themes: the work demonstrates strong foundational understanding and provides valuable contributions to the literature, but several sections require additional depth and rigor to meet publication standards.\n\nThe reviewers raise substantive concerns that cluster around three main areas. First, the builder concentration analysis and its implications for the 'inherited decentralization' thesis requires more rigorous treatment\u2014the current analysis acknowledges concentration but doesn't adequately explore how 3 builders controlling >70% of blocks affects the security model. Second, the preconfirmation economics section appears incomplete and lacks the game-theoretic formalization needed to address the fundamental tension between builder auction dynamics and commitment provision. Third, the fraud proof analysis for based optimistic rollups needs expansion to address derivation disputes and the modified bisection protocol requirements when L1 serves as the canonical data source.\n\nDespite these gaps, the manuscript's core contributions are sound and the identified issues are addressable through targeted revisions rather than fundamental restructuring. The empirical grounding from Taiko mainnet data, the accurate treatment of blob mechanics, and the clear articulation of trust assumption differences across sequencing models represent genuine contributions to the field.",
