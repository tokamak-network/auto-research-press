      "summary": "This is a comprehensive and well-structured survey of blockchain voting systems with strong technical depth on cryptographic mechanisms. The manuscript demonstrates solid understanding of security properties and provides useful practical guidance, though it lacks formal security proofs and leaves some critical areas (particularly the ZK credential section) incomplete.",
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent formal definitions of security properties (ballot secrecy, coercion resistance, receipt-freeness) with clear distinctions between commonly conflated concepts - the critical distinction between ballot secrecy and coercion resistance is particularly valuable",

        "The verifiability analysis for MACI understates a fundamental limitation: voters cannot independently verify their vote was counted correctly without trusting the coordinator, which arguably disqualifies it from true E2E verifiability under standard definitions"

        "Complete the truncated Section 5.2 and add a dedicated section on composing identity/Sybil solutions with cryptographic voting mechanisms, including formal analysis of how identity layer failures propagate to voting security",
        "Strengthen the MACI verifiability discussion by either (a) providing a formal argument for why coordinator trust is acceptable under specific threat models, or (b) discussing emerging solutions like multiple independent coordinators with threshold decryption that could achieve stronger verifiability",
        "Add a section on censorship resistance that analyzes forced inclusion mechanisms, timelock-based fallbacks, and the specific censorship vulnerabilities of L2 sequencers for rollup deployments - this is mentioned in the threat model but not adequately addressed"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript represents solid work that will be valuable to practitioners implementing blockchain voting systems. The formal definitions in Section 2.1 are particularly well-crafted and address common misconceptions in the field - for instance, explicitly noting that commit-reveal provides 'temporal privacy only (NOT ballot secrecy per Definition 1)' corrects a widespread misunderstanding. The MACI analysis is notably honest about trust assumptions, which is refreshing given the tendency in blockchain literature to oversell security properties.\n\nHowever, several areas require attention. First, the manuscript's treatment of verifiability needs refinement. The claim that MACI provides universal verifiability is technically correct (the tally proof is publicly verifiable), but the individual verifiability assessment deserves deeper analysis. Under Benaloh's original framework, individual verifiability requires voters to verify their vote was counted without trusting any single party - MACI fails this under coordinator compromise. The manuscript should either adopt a weaker definition explicitly or discuss this limitation more thoroughly.\n\nSecond, the security level discussion for BN254-based Groth16 (~110 bits) is accurate and important, but the implications for long-term security of voting records should be discussed. If votes must remain secret for decades (as in some governmental contexts), the reduced security margin may be unacceptable.\n\nThird, the MEV analysis in Section 5.1 is excellent and addresses a genuinely underexplored area, but it would benefit from discussing the interaction between MEV protection and liveness guarantees - private transaction submission can fail silently, potentially disenfranchising voters.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from a clearer threat model hierarchy. Currently, recommendations are stratified by economic stakes, but the appropriate system also depends on adversary capabilities (nation-state vs. opportunistic attacker) and whether coercion resistance is required. A decision tree or flowchart would help practitioners navigate these tradeoffs.",

      "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript represents solid work that would serve as a valuable reference for practitioners implementing blockchain voting systems. The formal security definitions in Section 2.1 are particularly well-crafted and address a genuine gap in how these properties are often conflated in practice. The critical analysis of commit-reveal's limitations regarding coercion resistance is accurate and important - many implementations incorrectly claim privacy properties that commit-reveal cannot provide.\n\nRegarding the gas cost analysis, the measurements appear reasonable and the methodology of using Sepolia testnet is appropriate, though I would strongly recommend including mainnet validation samples given the differences in state size and potential precompile behavior. The amortized MACI cost of ~55,000 gas per vote seems optimistic and should clarify assumptions about batch sizes and voter counts.\n\nThe smart contract upgrade patterns section appears to be missing entirely, which is concerning given it was listed as a focus area. Voting systems have unique upgrade challenges - how do you handle mid-election upgrades? What happens to committed votes if the reveal logic changes? The UUPS vs transparent proxy tradeoffs are particularly relevant here.\n\nFor the on-chain vs off-chain tradeoffs, the manuscript touches on this implicitly but never provides a systematic framework. Key questions remain unaddressed: What's the trust model when vote aggregation happens off-chain? How do you handle data availability for off-chain votes? What are the censorship resistance implications of relying on centralized sequencers for L2 deployments?\n\nThe MACI analysis is thorough but should acknowledge the practical challenges observed in production: coordinator key management complexity, the UX burden of key changes for coercion resistance, and the significant infrastructure requirements. The timing attack vulnerability discussion is valuable but could benefit from quantitative analysis of the timing windows in practice.\n\nFinally, the security level discussion correctly notes BN254's reduced security (~110 bits) but should more strongly recommend BLS12-381 for new deployments, especially given the long-term nature of voting records and potential future cryptanalytic advances.",

      "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript represents solid work on a practically important topic, with notable improvements in the MEV and Sybil resistance sections compared to what appears to be an earlier version. The MEV analysis in Section 5.1 is particularly valuable, providing concrete attack scenarios and actionable mitigation recommendations stratified by governance stakes. The formal security definitions in Section 2.1 are rigorous and the explicit distinction between ballot secrecy and coercion resistance addresses a common source of confusion.\n\nHowever, from my review perspective focusing on MEV/transaction ordering, Sybil resistance, and liveness/censorship resistance, several gaps remain. First, the document is clearly incomplete - Section 5.2 cuts off mid-code-block, and the promised analysis of censorship resistance in the threat model (Section 2.4) never materializes in the body. This is a significant omission given that censorship is arguably the most practical attack vector on L2s where most voting will occur.\n\nFor liveness, the manuscript mentions coordinator availability as a MACI trust assumption but doesn't analyze what happens when liveness fails. What are the timeout mechanisms? Can votes be recovered if a coordinator disappears? What participation threshold is needed for commit-reveal schemes to produce valid results? These operational concerns are critical for production deployments.\n\nThe Sybil resistance table is useful but lacks depth. The claim that Worldcoin provides 'High' Sybil resistance deserves scrutiny - what about the orb operator attack surface, biometric spoofing, or the centralized nature of the uniqueness database? Similarly, the interaction between Sybil attacks and the cryptographic layer needs exploration: if an attacker controls 30% of 'unique' identities in a Proof of Humanity registry, how does this propagate through MACI's anti-collusion guarantees?\n\nThe gas measurements and empirical methodology (referenced Appendix A) add credibility, though the appendix itself is not included. The client-side proof generation constraints table is practically valuable for implementers. I recommend completing the missing sections, adding formal liveness definitions and failure mode analysis, and deepening the Sybil resistance economics before this work is ready for publication.",

    "meta_review": "All three reviewers converge on a consistent assessment (7.2/10 average) of this blockchain voting systems survey, recognizing it as a comprehensive and technically rigorous contribution with strong formal definitions of security properties, excellent MEV analysis, and valuable empirical measurements. The reviewers unanimously praise the clear distinctions between ballot secrecy, coercion resistance, and receipt-freeness, as well as the thorough treatment of MACI's trust assumptions and practical implementation guidance with concrete gas costs and device-specific benchmarks.\n\nThe most critical issue identified by all reviewers is that the manuscript is clearly truncated mid-section (Section 5.2 ends abruptly during ZK credential verification code), leaving the Sybil resistance discussion incomplete and missing promised appendix content. Beyond this structural problem, reviewers identify substantive gaps: insufficient treatment of censorship resistance and liveness guarantees despite being listed in scope, lack of formal security proofs or reduction arguments for claimed properties, and missing analysis of real-world deployment failures and hybrid on-chain/off-chain architectures. The MACI verifiability claims are also questioned as potentially overstated given coordinator trust requirements.\n\nDespite these concerns, the reviewers agree the manuscript makes valuable contributions to the field and the identified issues are addressable through revision rather than fundamental restructuring. The technical foundation is sound, and the practical guidance is actionable. With completion of truncated sections and targeted additions addressing the identified gaps, this survey would represent a significant contribution to blockchain voting literature.",
