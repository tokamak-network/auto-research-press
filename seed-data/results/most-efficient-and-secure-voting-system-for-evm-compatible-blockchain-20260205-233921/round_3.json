      "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript represents solid work on a practically important topic. The formal treatment of security properties is particularly valuable - the distinction between temporal privacy and true ballot secrecy (Section 3.2) addresses a common source of confusion in the field. The critical analysis of MACI's verifiability properties is commendable; too many treatments uncritically accept MACI as providing E2E verifiability when it demonstrably does not under standard definitions. However, several issues require attention. First, the document is incomplete - it cuts off mid-table in Section 4.2, and the promised sections on MEV exploitation, Sybil resistance propagation, censorship resistance, smart contract upgradeability patterns, and hybrid architectures are missing. These are not minor omissions; MEV and censorship resistance are existential concerns for blockchain voting systems. Second, the empirical methodology is referenced but not provided - claims about gas measurements 'from Ethereum Sepolia testnet, December 2024' and 'Appendix A' cannot be verified. Third, the comparison of proof systems would benefit from discussing recursive proof composition for vote aggregation, which is increasingly relevant for scalability. Fourth, the Sybil resistance table, while useful, could be strengthened with more rigorous analysis of attack costs and threat models. Finally, consider discussing the tension between upgradeability (needed for bug fixes) and immutability (needed for election integrity) - this is mentioned in the research objectives but not addressed in the provided content.",

      "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript represents solid work on a practically important topic, but several issues prevent it from reaching publication quality. First, the obvious incompleteness is a major concern - the document promises analysis of MEV attacks, censorship resistance, and implementation guidance in Section 1.2 but cuts off before delivering these sections. The existing content is generally accurate, though I note the ~110-bit security claim for BN254 should cite the specific Kim-Barbulescu result more precisely (the attack affects the discrete log problem in extension fields, not the elliptic curve discrete log directly). The treatment of verifiability properties is commendable - too many papers in this space conflate ballot secrecy with coercion resistance or claim E2E verifiability for systems that only provide universal verifiability. However, the manuscript would benefit from engaging more deeply with the theoretical foundations. Specifically, the Juels-Catalano-Jakobsson impossibility result (2005) establishes fundamental limits on achieving coercion resistance with receipt-freeness in remote voting settings - this should be discussed. The MACI analysis correctly identifies the coordinator trust assumption but could go further in analyzing the game-theoretic aspects: under what conditions is the coordinator incentivized to behave honestly? The liveness analysis tables are useful but lack formal treatment - what are the actual availability requirements for t-of-n threshold systems? The empirical measurements are valuable but would benefit from statistical characterization (variance, confidence intervals) rather than point estimates. Finally, the manuscript should address post-quantum considerations given that voting systems may need to protect ballot secrecy for extended periods.",

      "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript represents solid work on a complex topic, with particular strength in its cryptographic analysis and honest treatment of system limitations. The formal definitions in Section 2.1 are exemplary and should serve as a reference for future work. The MACI analysis in Section 3.5 is notably thorough, correctly identifying the tension between coercion resistance and strict E2E verifiability - a nuance often glossed over in promotional materials.\n\nHowever, the manuscript's treatment of the three focus areas (MEV, Sybil resistance, liveness/censorship) is uneven. The Sybil resistance table in Section 2.2 is useful but lacks depth on how identity layer failures propagate to voting security (promised in Section 5.2 but not delivered). The liveness analysis is scattered across sections rather than consolidated, making it difficult to assess the complete threat model.\n\nThe MEV discussion is particularly concerning given its prominence in the research objectives. The attack resistance matrix marks several systems as 'partially protected' against MEV but provides no substantive analysis of what attacks are possible, their economic viability, or mitigation strategies. For commit-reveal specifically, the reveal phase creates a known MEV opportunity where miners/validators can observe reveal transactions and potentially front-run or reorder them - this deserves explicit treatment.\n\nThe truncation is a significant issue that must be resolved before this work can be properly evaluated. The missing sections appear to contain critical analysis that would substantially affect the overall assessment. Additionally, while the empirical measurements are valuable, the methodology appendix is referenced but not included, making it impossible to verify the measurement validity.\n\nFor the censorship resistance analysis, I would recommend examining the specific guarantees provided by different L2 architectures: optimistic rollups with their 7-day challenge periods create different censorship dynamics than ZK rollups with faster finality. The interaction between sequencer centralization (common in current L2 deployments) and vote censorship resistance deserves explicit treatment, particularly given the recommendation to deploy on optimistic rollups in the executive summary.",

    "meta_review": "All three reviewers converge on a consistent assessment (7.2/10 average) of this blockchain voting systems survey, recognizing its substantial technical contributions while identifying a critical structural problem: the manuscript is clearly truncated mid-sentence in Section 4.2, with promised Sections 5-7 on MEV attacks, implementation guidance, and future directions entirely missing. The reviewers unanimously praise the formal security property definitions (Definitions 1-8), the nuanced and honest treatment of MACI's limitations regarding E2E verifiability, and the practical grounding through empirical gas measurements. These strengths represent genuine contributions to the field.\n\nThe primary weakness is unambiguous: the manuscript is incomplete. All reviewers note that critical promised content\u2014particularly the MEV analysis (Section 5.1), censorship resistance discussion (Section 5.3), and the referenced Appendix A with measurement methodology\u2014are missing. Secondary concerns include limited treatment of impossibility results in voting theory, insufficient depth on post-quantum considerations given long-term vote secrecy requirements, and some categorical confusion in the Sybil resistance comparison table. However, these are addressable issues that do not undermine the fundamental quality of the existing content.\n\nGiven this is the final review round and the core technical content that exists is of high quality, the path forward is clear: the authors must complete the truncated sections to deliver on the manuscript's stated scope. The existing material demonstrates the authors' capability to produce rigorous analysis; the issue is simply that the work was submitted incomplete.",
