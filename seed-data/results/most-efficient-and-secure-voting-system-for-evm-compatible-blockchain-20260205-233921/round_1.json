      "detailed_feedback": "The manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge of blockchain voting systems but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive research report. The gas cost analysis, which should be central to efficiency claims, relies heavily on estimated ranges (e.g., '200,000-500,000 gas' for ZK verification) without specifying proof systems, circuit sizes, or measurement conditions. The claim that 'gas costs can be reduced by 60-85% through batching and layer-2 deployment' in the executive summary is not substantiated with empirical data anywhere in the document. The security analysis, while covering the right properties, lacks formal treatment - for instance, the claim that MACI achieves 'receipt-freeness through key-change mechanism' deserves more rigorous analysis of the conditions under which this holds (e.g., timing assumptions, coordinator behavior). The code examples, while illustrative, contain simplifications that could mislead implementers - the ElGamal homomorphic addition in the EnhancedVoting contract uses addmod which is incorrect for elliptic curve operations. The comparison tables are useful but would benefit from citations to security proofs or audit reports rather than checkmarks. The treatment of emerging technologies (FHE, account abstraction) is appropriately forward-looking but speculative timelines ('2-3 years') should be qualified with technical milestones required. Overall, this reads more as a practitioner's guide than a research contribution, which is valuable but should be positioned accordingly.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "MEV and transaction ordering attacks receive only cursory treatment (single row in attack matrix marked as 'front-running'), despite being critical attack vectors that can compromise vote privacy, enable vote manipulation through sandwich attacks, and allow strategic last-block voting even in commit-reveal schemes",
        "Sybil resistance is mentioned briefly but lacks rigorous analysis of identity/eligibility verification approaches\u2014the manuscript assumes Merkle tree eligibility proofs without discussing how the eligibility set is constructed, maintained, or protected against Sybil attacks at the identity layer",
        "Liveness and censorship resistance guarantees are essentially absent from the analysis, despite being fundamental to voter participation\u2014no discussion of what happens when validators/sequencers selectively censor vote transactions, or how different L2 architectures affect censorship resistance"

      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated section on MEV attack vectors specific to voting: analyze how commit-reveal can be attacked via mempool observation and block builder collusion, discuss MEV-resistant transaction submission (private mempools, commit chains, threshold encryption of transactions), and quantify the economic incentives for MEV extraction in high-stakes votes",
        "Expand Sybil resistance analysis to cover the full identity stack: compare approaches like proof-of-humanity, BrightID, Worldcoin, credential-based systems (Sismo, Polygon ID), and analyze their trust assumptions, privacy properties, and failure modes in voting contexts",
        "Include rigorous analysis of liveness and censorship resistance: compare L1 vs L2 censorship resistance properties, discuss forced inclusion mechanisms, analyze the impact of sequencer centralization on vote censorship, and provide concrete recommendations for achieving censorship-resistant vote submission"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From my review perspective focusing on MEV/transaction ordering, Sybil resistance, and liveness guarantees, this manuscript has significant gaps that undermine its claim to comprehensively address 'secure' voting systems. On MEV: the commit-reveal scheme is presented as solving front-running, but this is incomplete\u2014sophisticated attackers can still extract value through mempool observation during the reveal phase, sandwich attacks on vote-dependent token prices, and collusion with block builders to strategically order reveals. The manuscript should analyze private transaction submission mechanisms (Flashbots Protect, MEV Blocker), threshold-encrypted mempools, and the specific MEV risks in each proposed architecture. On Sybil resistance: the ZK-based eligibility verification via Merkle proofs is a cryptographic mechanism, not a Sybil resistance mechanism\u2014it only proves membership in a predefined set without addressing how that set achieves one-person-one-vote or prevents wealth-based Sybil attacks. The manuscript conflates token-weighted voting (explicitly not Sybil-resistant) with identity-based eligibility without adequately distinguishing these threat models. On liveness: the comparison of L2 solutions mentions finality times but ignores censorship resistance entirely. Optimistic rollups with centralized sequencers can trivially censor vote transactions; the 7-day challenge period doesn't help if your vote was never included. The manuscript should discuss forced transaction inclusion mechanisms, escape hatches, and the concrete censorship resistance properties of each recommended deployment target. These omissions are particularly concerning given the manuscript's practical orientation\u2014organizations following these recommendations without understanding these attack vectors could deploy systems vulnerable to sophisticated adversaries.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The security analysis of ballot secrecy is incomplete\u2014the manuscript conflates temporal privacy (commit-reveal) with cryptographic privacy (ZK/homomorphic) without adequately distinguishing their threat model implications; specifically, commit-reveal provides NO ballot secrecy after reveal phase, which undermines coercion resistance claims",
        "Verifiability properties are poorly defined and analyzed: the manuscript mentions 'universal verifiability' but fails to distinguish between individual verifiability, universal verifiability, and end-to-end verifiability (E2E-V), nor does it analyze which systems achieve which properties",
        "The ZK-proof system comparison lacks rigor\u2014security level claims (e.g., '~100-128 bit' for Groth16 on BN254) are imprecise and the manuscript doesn't address the practical implications of the 110-bit security of BN254 versus the claimed 128-bit security levels elsewhere"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a formal definitions section covering ballot secrecy, coercion resistance, receipt-freeness, and the three types of verifiability (individual, universal, E2E), then systematically evaluate each system against these definitions with precise threat model assumptions",
        "Revise the security analysis of commit-reveal to accurately reflect that it provides ZERO coercion resistance (voters can prove their vote by revealing commitment before the reveal phase to a coercer) and clarify that MACI's coercion resistance relies on specific trust assumptions about the coordinator",
        "Provide more rigorous analysis of ZK proof system selection: compare Groth16, PLONK, and Halo2 specifically for voting circuits, discuss the trusted setup implications in detail, and address the verification gas costs for different circuit sizes relevant to voting (e.g., Merkle tree depth, number of candidates)"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a security perspective, this manuscript requires significant strengthening in its treatment of the core voting security properties. The attack resistance matrix in Section 4.1 is misleading: marking commit-reveal as providing protection against 'vote visibility' with a warning symbol obscures the fundamental limitation that all votes become public after the reveal phase. This is not merely 'temporal' privacy\u2014it's a complete failure of ballot secrecy for any threat model where the adversary can wait until after the election. Similarly, the claim that ZK-based systems provide partial protection against vote buying (marked with \u26a0\ufe0f) needs elaboration: without MACI's key-change mechanism, ZK proofs alone do not prevent a voter from proving their vote to a briber by sharing their witness.\n\nThe treatment of MACI's security properties, while generally accurate, understates the trust assumptions. The coordinator learns all votes in plaintext during processing\u2014this is a significant centralization risk that the manuscript acknowledges but doesn't adequately weight in the recommendations. The claim that MACI provides 'receipt-freeness through key-change mechanism' is technically correct but practically limited: if a coercer demands proof of a vote BEFORE the voter has opportunity to change keys, the system fails. The manuscript should discuss timing attacks and the practical constraints on key rotation.\n\nRegarding ZK proof efficiency, the gas cost estimates for verification (200,000-500,000 gas) are reasonable but the manuscript doesn't address the critical issue of proof generation time on client devices. For a voting system to be practical, voters must be able to generate proofs on mobile devices within seconds\u2014this constraint significantly impacts circuit design choices and should inform the recommendation of specific proof systems. The manuscript also doesn't discuss the implications of using Poseidon hash (as in MACI) versus Pedersen commitments for Merkle trees, which has substantial impact on both prover time and verifier gas costs.\n\nThe homomorphic encryption section correctly identifies the gas cost challenges but doesn't explore threshold decryption in sufficient depth. For practical deployment, the key management for threshold Paillier or threshold ElGamal is a critical design consideration that affects both security (what if threshold parties collude?) and liveness (what if threshold parties go offline?). The enhanced voting contract in Section 6.2 uses ElGamal but the security analysis doesn't address the malleability of ElGamal ciphertexts or the need for proof of correct encryption.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from discussing formal verification efforts for voting smart contracts and the specific vulnerabilities that have been found in production systems beyond the Compound incident mentioned.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of blockchain voting architectures with practical implementation guidance. All three reviewers consistently praise the work's clear organization, accessible presentation of complex cryptographic concepts, and actionable decision framework for practitioners. The coverage spanning from simple token-weighted voting to advanced MACI implementations is thorough, and the inclusion of real-world case studies (Gitcoin, Compound, Snapshot) grounds the theoretical discussion effectively.\n\nHowever, the reviewers identify several significant gaps that undermine the manuscript's contribution. Most critically, the security analysis lacks rigor in multiple dimensions: (1) the treatment of MEV and transaction ordering attacks is superficial despite their critical importance to voting integrity; (2) the manuscript conflates temporal privacy (commit-reveal) with cryptographic privacy without clarifying that commit-reveal provides zero coercion resistance after the reveal phase; (3) Sybil resistance and liveness/censorship resistance receive inadequate attention despite being fundamental to real-world deployment security. Additionally, the claimed gas cost benchmarks lack empirical validation\u2014the appendix promising measured values is incomplete, and the 60-85% batching reduction claim has no supporting methodology. The novelty scores (5/10 across all reviewers) indicate the work primarily synthesizes existing knowledge without sufficient original contribution.\n\nWhile the manuscript has clear practical value, addressing these gaps requires substantial revision rather than minor corrections. The missing smart contract upgrade patterns section, incomplete formal security definitions, and superficial on-chain/off-chain tradeoff analysis represent significant omissions that must be remedied for the work to meet publication standards.",

These revisions will require substantial effort but are achievable within a revision cycle. The authors should also consider whether novel contributions beyond synthesis can be strengthened\u2014all reviewers noted limited novelty, which could be addressed by providing original empirical measurements, novel comparative frameworks, or new security analysis results.",
