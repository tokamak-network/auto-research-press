      "detailed_feedback": "As a reviewer focused on literary theory and interdisciplinary applications, I must note a significant discrepancy between the authors' response and the actual revision. The authors committed to 'a minimum of 18-20 scholarly sources' including direct citations to Derrida's primary texts and engagement with Bennington, Gasch\u00e9, Caputo, Critchley, Spivak, and Butler. The revised manuscript contains exactly two citations\u2014Maleuvre and Long\u2014neither of which represents the promised engagement with major Derrida scholarship. This is a serious failure to implement stated revisions. The content improvements are genuine: the new material on hospitality effectively distinguishes conditional from unconditional hospitality, the discussion of 'democracy to come' captures its structural rather than teleological character, and the hauntology section appropriately contextualizes Specters of Marx. The de Man affair and Searle debate are now addressed. However, without proper citations, these improvements cannot be verified against the scholarly record. The claim that Spivak and Butler represent 'prominent examples' of Derrida's influence remains unsupported by any citation to their actual work. The promised subsection on 'Deconstruction and Literary Criticism' (300-400 words) appears only as a single sentence mentioning the Yale School. For a manuscript claiming to assess Derrida's impact on literary and cultural studies, this remains a critical gap. I cannot in good conscience raise my score substantially when the most fundamental scholarly apparatus\u2014the citation base\u2014remains essentially unchanged from the first submission.",

        "The treatment of Speech and Phenomena, while improved, still lacks the technical precision needed to explain how Derrida's critique of the 'living present' and the voice as self-presence actually works; the retention/protention analysis is mentioned but not adequately developed",
        "The engagement with secondary scholarship promised in the author response (Gasch\u00e9's 'Tain of the Mirror', Bennington, Spivak's preface) is entirely absent, leaving the philosophical exposition without scholarly grounding"

        "Immediately implement the promised citation overhaul: cite Of Grammatology, Speech and Phenomena, Writing and Difference, and Margins of Philosophy directly with page references; engage with Gasch\u00e9's analysis of 'infrastructures' and Spivak's translator's preface as committed",
        "Expand the Speech and Phenomena discussion to show specifically how Husserl's analysis of the 'living present' deconstructs itself\u2014explain how the necessary role of retention and protention means that the present is never simply present, and how this undermines the phenomenological project of grounding knowledge in self-presence",
        "Add textual analysis demonstrating the logic of supplementarity: quote and analyze specific passages from Derrida's reading of Rousseau on writing as 'dangerous supplement' to show how the argument actually works rather than merely summarizing its conclusions"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of Continental Philosophy and Phenomenology, this revision represents a genuine but incomplete response to my previous concerns. The conceptual exposition has improved markedly: the treatment of diff\u00e9rance now properly triangulates between Saussure's differential theory of value, Husserl's phenomenology of time-consciousness, and Heidegger's ontological difference. The observation that the silent 'a' in diff\u00e9rance 'performs the very priority of writing' is apt. The sections on trace and supplementarity, while still somewhat schematic, now provide the substantive analysis that was entirely lacking before. However, the most serious deficiency\u2014the citation apparatus\u2014has not been addressed at all. The authors explicitly committed to citing Derrida's primary texts directly and engaging with major secondary literature (Gasch\u00e9, Bennington, Spivak), yet the revision contains only two citations, both to secondary sources tangential to the core philosophical exposition. This is not merely a formal problem: without direct engagement with Derrida's texts, claims about what he argues remain unverifiable assertions. For instance, the discussion of Speech and Phenomena would benefit enormously from quoting Derrida's actual analysis of Husserl's concept of Bedeutung and the 'solitary mental life.' Similarly, the supplementarity discussion should cite specific passages from Of Grammatology's reading of Rousseau. The philosophical content has improved from inadequate to competent, but the scholarly apparatus has not improved at all, which significantly undermines the manuscript's credibility as a research document.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The revision demonstrates genuine engagement with my Round 1 feedback, and I recognize the substantial improvements in intellectual-historical contextualization. The new section on structuralism effectively explains Derrida's complex positioning vis-\u00e0-vis the movement, and the treatment of Saussure's phonocentrism is now adequate. The controversies section is markedly improved\u2014the Cambridge affair includes the specific vote and key opponents, and the de Man affair is no longer absent. However, I must express serious concern about the citation apparatus, which represents a broken promise to the reviewers. The authors explicitly committed to 'direct citations to Derrida's primary texts' and 'a minimum of 18-20 scholarly sources,' yet the revised manuscript contains only two citations, both to secondary sources that are tangential to Derrida scholarship proper. The Maleuvre piece on monolingualism is relevant but cannot carry the weight of supporting claims about diff\u00e9rance, trace, supplementarity, the Cambridge affair, or the de Man controversy. Where is Peeters' biography for biographical claims? Where is Gasch\u00e9's 'Tain of the Mirror' for the discussion of infrastructures? Where is any citation to Derrida's own texts? Claims about what Derrida argues in 'Speech and Phenomena' or 'Of Grammatology' require citations to those works. The manuscript makes numerous specific claims\u2014about the 1940 expulsion, the ENS admission in 1952, the 1967 publications, the Cambridge vote\u2014that require proper sourcing. Additionally, while the Foucault debate and Tel Quel association are now mentioned, they remain underdeveloped. A single sentence noting the 1963 lecture on Foucault does not constitute adequate treatment of one of the most significant intellectual exchanges of the period. The manuscript has improved from adequate to good in terms of content coverage, but the citation failure prevents me from scoring it higher on rigor or citations.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript on Derrida presents a genuine editorial dilemma. The authors have demonstrably improved the substantive philosophical content: the treatment of diff\u00e9rance now properly engages Saussure, Husserl, and Heidegger; new sections on trace, supplementarity, hospitality, and 'democracy to come' address major gaps; and the coverage of controversies (Cambridge affair, de Man) is now appropriately detailed. The 0.8-point improvement reflects real intellectual work, and all three reviewers acknowledge these gains. The prose remains clear and accessible\u2014no small achievement when explaining Derrida.\n\nHowever, I cannot overlook the central failure: the authors explicitly committed to overhauling the citation apparatus with 18-20 sources, including primary Derrida texts and major secondary scholarship (Gasch\u00e9, Bennington, Spivak, Caputo). They delivered two tangential citations. This is not a minor oversight\u2014it represents a fundamental breach of the revision commitment. For a philosophical reference work, citations are not decorative; they ground claims, enable verification, and situate the work within scholarly discourse. A manuscript about Derrida that cites no Derrida is structurally deficient, regardless of how competently it summarizes his ideas.\n\nThe reviewers are not being unreasonable here. They are not demanding novel research or theoretical innovation\u2014they are asking for basic scholarly apparatus that the authors themselves promised. This is a fixable problem, but it requires actual implementation, not another round of promises. Given that this is the final round, I am reluctant to reject outright given the genuine content improvements, but I cannot accept a manuscript that fails to meet the minimum citation standards for academic philosophy. One additional revision focused specifically on the citation apparatus is warranted.",

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript and for their careful assessment of our revisions. We are gratified that the reviewers recognize the substantial content improvements made in Round 1, including the expanded treatment of diff\u00e9rance, the new sections on trace and supplementarity, the coverage of Derrida's later ethical and political work (hospitality, democracy to come, hauntology), and the improved discussion of controversies including the Cambridge affair and de Man affair.\n\nHowever, we must acknowledge a serious failure on our part: despite our explicit commitment in the Round 1 response to overhaul the citation apparatus with 18-20 scholarly sources including primary Derrida texts and major secondary literature, we did not implement these changes. All three reviewers have rightly identified this as a critical deficiency that undermines the credibility of our manuscript. We offer no excuses for this oversight and commit to rectifying it fully in this revision. We also acknowledge the remaining gaps in our treatment of literary criticism, the Searle debate, and the Foucault relationship. Below, we provide detailed responses to each reviewer and a comprehensive plan for revision.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Applications)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 1's acknowledgment of the genuine content improvements while recognizing that their overall score of 5.7/10 reflects the critical failure to implement our promised citation overhaul. The citation score of 3/10 is entirely justified given the discrepancy between our stated commitments and actual revisions.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation apparatus remains fundamentally inadequate despite explicit promises**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. Our failure to implement the promised citations represents a serious breach of trust with the reviewers. There is no justification for this oversight, and we take full responsibility.\n   - **Action taken**: We will now implement the citation overhaul in full. The revised manuscript will include:\n     - Primary Derrida texts: *Of Grammatology* (1967), *Speech and Phenomena* (1967), *Writing and Difference* (1967), *Margins of Philosophy* (1972), *Limited Inc* (1988), *Specters of Marx* (1993), *Of Hospitality* (1997), and *Rogues* (2003), with specific page references for all substantive claims\n     - Secondary scholarship: Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's translator's preface to *Of Grammatology*; Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9's *The Tain of the Mirror* (1986); Geoffrey Bennington's contributions to *Jacques Derrida* (1991); John Caputo's *Deconstruction in a Nutshell* (1997); Simon Critchley's *The Ethics of Deconstruction* (1992); Beno\u00eet Peeters' *Derrida: A Biography* (2010)\n     - Interdisciplinary applications: Spivak's \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" (1988); Butler's *Gender Trouble* (1990); critical legal studies sources demonstrating concrete influence\n     - The Maleuvre and Long citations will be retained where appropriate but supplemented with this more robust scholarly apparatus\n\n2. **Promised subsection on \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" not delivered**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that our promised 300-400 word dedicated subsection appears only as a single sentence. This was another failure to implement stated revisions.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated subsection (350-400 words) titled \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" that traces:\n     - The institutional reception through the Yale School (Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman, Harold Bloom)\n     - Barbara Johnson's work on close reading and deconstruction\n     - The transformation of literary studies methodology in the 1970s-80s\n     - Specific examples of deconstructive reading practices with citations to primary critical texts\n\n3. **Interdisciplinary influence asserted but not demonstrated with citations**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that claims about Spivak and Butler's engagement with Derrida require direct citation to their work, not mere assertion.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add concrete examples with proper citations:\n     - Spivak's \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" with analysis of how she deploys deconstructive strategies\n     - Butler's *Gender Trouble* with specific discussion of how she draws on Derrida's critique of origins\n     - Critical legal studies: Roberto Unger and Duncan Kennedy's use of deconstructive methods, with appropriate citations\n\n**Minor Points**: We will remove the Schneider reference entirely (as noted, it was removed but not adequately replaced) and ensure all citations directly support claims about Derrida's influence.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Continental Philosophy and Phenomenology)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 2 for recognizing the substantial improvements in our exposition of diff\u00e9rance, trace, and supplementarity, and for the fair assessment reflected in the 6.0/10 score. We accept that the citation failure (3/10) prevents a higher overall evaluation.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation apparatus \"catastrophically inadequate\" with no primary Derrida texts cited**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this characterization. A manuscript making claims about Derrida's arguments in *Speech and Phenomena* or *Of Grammatology* without citing those texts lacks basic scholarly credibility.\n   - **Action taken**: As detailed above, we will cite all major primary texts with page references. For the philosophical exposition specifically:\n     - *Speech and Phenomena*: citations for the critique of Husserl's \"living present,\" the analysis of *Bedeutung*, and the \"solitary mental life\" discussion\n     - *Of Grammatology*: citations for the Rousseau reading, the \"dangerous supplement\" analysis, and the critique of phonocentrism\n     - *Margins of Philosophy*: citation for \"Diff\u00e9rance\" essay with specific page references for the Saussure, Husserl, and Heidegger triangulation\n     - Gasch\u00e9's *The Tain of the Mirror* will be cited for the analysis of \"infrastructures\" and the relationship between deconstruction and transcendental philosophy\n\n2. **Speech and Phenomena treatment lacks technical precision on the \"living present\"**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that mentioning retention/protention without adequately developing the analysis weakens the philosophical exposition.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand this section (approximately 150-200 additional words) to explain:\n     - How Husserl's analysis of time-consciousness requires retention (just-past) and protention (just-about-to-be) as constitutive of the present moment\n     - How this necessary structure means the present is always already divided, never simply self-identical\n     - How this undermines the phenomenological project of grounding knowledge in the self-presence of consciousness\n     - Direct quotation from Derrida's text demonstrating the argument\n\n3. **Supplementarity discussion summarizes conclusions without showing the argument**\n   - **Our response**: This is a valid criticism. Philosophical exposition should demonstrate argumentative logic, not merely report conclusions.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add textual analysis (150-200 words) that:\n     - Quotes specific passages from Derrida's reading of Rousseau on writing as \"dangerous supplement\"\n     - Shows how the supplement is both addition (external, inessential) and substitution (taking the place of what it supplements)\n     - Demonstrates how this logic reveals that what appears primary (speech, nature, presence) is always already supplemented\n     - Includes page references to *Of Grammatology* Part II\n\n**Minor Points**: We will ensure that the engagement with Bennington and Spivak's translator's preface is substantive rather than merely nominal, with specific discussion of their interpretive contributions.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Intellectual History and French Theory)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 3's recognition of the substantial improvements in intellectual-historical contextualization and controversy coverage. The 6.0/10 score fairly reflects genuine content improvement alongside the critical citation failure.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation apparatus remains critically underdeveloped despite promises**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. Claims about biographical facts, institutional history, and intellectual debates require proper sourcing.\n   - **Action taken**: In addition to the primary and secondary sources listed above, we will add:\n     - Peeters' *Derrida: A Biography* for all biographical claims (1940 expulsion, ENS admission, 1967 publications)\n     - Fran\u00e7ois Cusset's *French Theory* (2008) for the American reception\n     - Proper documentation for the Cambridge affair including contemporary accounts\n     - Citations for claims about the de Man affair and Derrida's response \"Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell\"\n\n2. **Searle debate mentioned but not substantively analyzed**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that introducing iterability without explaining the philosophical stakes leaves the discussion incomplete.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand the Searle debate section (200-250 additional words) to explain:\n     - Austin's speech act theory and the distinction between serious and parasitic utterances\n     - Derrida's critique in \"Signature Event Context\": iterability as the condition of possibility for any sign\n     - Searle's response defending the determinacy of illocutionary force\n     - Derrida's reply in \"Limited Inc a b c...\" and the philosophical stakes regarding context, intention, and meaning\n     - Citations to *Limited Inc* and relevant secondary literature\n\n3. **Foucault relationship gestured toward but not developed**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that a single sentence on the 1963 lecture is inadequate treatment of a significant intellectual exchange.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated paragraph (150-200 words) on the Derrida-Foucault relationship:\n     - Derrida's \"Cogito and the History of Madness\" (1963): his critique of Foucault's reading of Descartes in *History of Madness*\n     - The philosophical stakes: whether reason can speak about madness, the status of the Cartesian exclusion\n     - Foucault's response in the revised edition and the appendix \"My Body, This Paper, This Fire\"\n     - The broader significance of this exchange for understanding both thinkers' projects\n     - Citations to both primary texts and secondary scholarship (e.g., work by Leonard Lawlor)\n\n**Minor Points**: We will develop the Tel Quel association beyond mere mention, explaining Derrida's relationship with Philippe Sollers and the journal's role in disseminating his early work, with appropriate citations.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Citation Overhaul (Critical Priority)**:\n- Add 8-10 primary Derrida texts with specific page references\n- Add 8-10 major secondary sources (Gasch\u00e9, Bennington, Spivak, Caputo, Critchley, Peeters, Cusset)\n- Add interdisciplinary sources demonstrating concrete influence (Spivak, Butler, critical legal studies)\n- Total citations: 20-25 scholarly sources (exceeding our original commitment)\n\n**Content Expansions**:\n- New dedicated subsection: \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" (350-400 words)\n- Expanded *Speech and Phenomena* analysis with technical precision on the \"living present\" (150-200 words)\n- Expanded supplementarity discussion with textual analysis and quotation (150-200 words)\n- Expanded Searle debate with philosophical stakes (200-250 words)\n- New paragraph on Derrida-Foucault relationship (150-200 words)\n- Developed Tel Quel discussion\n\n**Structural Improvements**:\n- All substantive claims linked to specific citations\n- Biographical facts sourced to Peeters\n- Controversy details properly documented\n- Interdisciplinary influence demonstrated rather than asserted\n\nWe are committed to delivering these revisions in full and recognize that our credibility with the reviewers depends on actually implementing what we promise. We thank the reviewers for their patience and continued engagement with this manuscript.",
