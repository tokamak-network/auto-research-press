      "summary": "This manuscript provides a competent introduction to Derrida's biography and early deconstructive work, but suffers from significant gaps in coverage of his later ethical and political writings, minimal engagement with contemporary scholarship, and a remarkably thin citation base that undermines its scholarly credibility. The interdisciplinary applications promised in the framing are largely absent.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear and accessible prose that effectively communicates complex philosophical concepts to non-specialist readers",
        "Strong integration of biographical context with philosophical development, particularly regarding Derrida's Algerian Jewish experience",
        "Thoughtful treatment of the 'Monolingualism of the Other' and its implications for understanding linguistic belonging"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Severely inadequate coverage of Derrida's later ethical and political writings\u2014hospitality is mentioned only briefly, while crucial concepts like 'democracy to come,' 'specters' (Specters of Marx), autoimmunity, and the gift are entirely absent or underdeveloped",
        "Only three citations for a comprehensive research report on a major philosopher is wholly insufficient; major secondary literature (Bennington, Caputo, Critchley, Spivak, Butler, Nancy) is completely ignored",
        "The Schneider reference on extraterrestrial life is a puzzling and tangential inclusion that does not meaningfully illuminate Derridean thought or its interdisciplinary applications"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Substantially expand coverage of post-1990 works: 'Specters of Marx' (1993), 'The Gift of Death' (1995), 'Of Hospitality' (1997), 'Rogues' (2003), and the concept of 'democracy to come' require dedicated analysis",
        "Engage with major Derrida scholars and the extensive secondary literature\u2014at minimum, works by Geoffrey Bennington, John Caputo, Simon Critchley, Gayatri Spivak, and Judith Butler should be consulted and cited",
        "Replace or substantially contextualize the Schneider reference with scholarship that actually demonstrates Derrida's interdisciplinary impact in fields like literary theory, postcolonial studies, feminist theory, legal studies, and architecture"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of literary theory and interdisciplinary applications, this manuscript presents a troubling paradox: it gestures toward Derrida's broad influence while failing to document or analyze that influence in any substantive way. The claim that Derrida's concepts 'have become part of the common vocabulary of contemporary theory' is asserted but never demonstrated through engagement with actual literary or cultural criticism. Where is the discussion of how deconstruction transformed literary studies through figures like Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, and the Yale School? Where is the engagement with Spivak's deconstructive postcolonialism or Butler's deconstructive feminism? The manuscript's treatment of Derrida's later work is particularly deficient. The concept of 'specters' and spectrality\u2014central to Derrida's engagement with Marx and enormously influential in cultural studies, hauntology, and memory studies\u2014receives no attention. The 'democracy to come' (d\u00e9mocratie \u00e0 venir), arguably Derrida's most significant contribution to political philosophy, is mentioned only in passing without explication. The discussion of hospitality, while present, lacks the depth needed to convey its importance for contemporary debates about migration, sovereignty, and ethics. The citation apparatus is inadequate for a scholarly research report. Three sources\u2014one of which (Schneider) is only tangentially relevant\u2014cannot support the breadth of claims made here. The absence of engagement with Derrida's own primary texts (no direct citations to 'Of Grammatology,' 'Writing and Difference,' etc.) and with the substantial body of Derrida scholarship published over the past three decades significantly undermines the manuscript's authority. I would recommend this manuscript be substantially revised to include: (1) dedicated sections on the ethical turn and political writings; (2) concrete examples of Derrida's influence on literary criticism, postcolonial theory, gender studies, and legal theory; (3) engagement with at least 15-20 scholarly sources representing the current state of Derrida scholarship.",

      "suggestions": [
        "Add substantial sections contextualizing Derrida within French intellectual history: his complex relationship to structuralism, his participation in and distance from Tel Quel, his debates with Foucault over madness and reason, and his position vis-\u00e0-vis phenomenology in France",
        "Include detailed treatment of the major controversies: the 1992 Cambridge affair (with actual vote numbers and key figures like Barry Smith), the de Man affair and Derrida's response in 'Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell,' and the extended Searle debate published as 'Limited Inc'",
        "Dramatically expand the citation base to include primary sources (Derrida's own texts), standard biographical works (Beno\u00eet Peeters' biography), and major scholarly assessments (Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9, Christopher Norris, Geoffrey Bennington)"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of intellectual history, this manuscript presents a fundamentally decontextualized portrait of Derrida. While the biographical section on Algeria is competent, it fails to situate Derrida within the specific intellectual milieu that shaped his work. The 1960s French intellectual scene\u2014dominated by structuralism, the influence of Saussure and L\u00e9vi-Strauss, the debates around Marxism and psychoanalysis\u2014is essential context for understanding why Derrida's interventions mattered when they did. The manuscript mentions Saussure but does not explain Derrida's position relative to the structuralist movement or his complex relationship to figures like L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Barthes, and Lacan. The Tel Quel group, with which Derrida was associated in the late 1960s before distancing himself, goes entirely unmentioned. Similarly, the famous debate with Foucault over the Cogito and madness in Descartes\u2014a defining moment in French theory\u2014is absent. The treatment of controversies is particularly deficient for a research report claiming to examine Derrida's reception. The Cambridge affair is mentioned but without the specificity required: the actual vote was 336 to 204, the opposition letter was signed by figures including Barry Smith and Ruth Barcan Marcus, and the affair crystallized long-standing tensions between analytic and continental philosophy. More seriously, the de Man affair\u2014the revelation of Paul de Man's wartime collaborationist writings and Derrida's controversial defense\u2014is entirely absent, despite being arguably the most significant controversy affecting Derrida's reputation. The Searle debate, which produced 'Limited Inc' and remains central to understanding Derrida's theory of iterability and speech acts, is also missing. The citation apparatus is inadequate for scholarly work on this topic. The three sources cited are tangential: a review essay, a theological response, and a paper on extraterrestrial life. None of Derrida's own works are cited directly, nor are standard scholarly treatments. Claims about the Vichy laws, the ENS admission, the 1967 publications, and the Cambridge vote all require proper citation to primary or authoritative secondary sources.",

        "The treatment of diff\u00e9rance is superficial\u2014the manuscript mentions 'to differ' and 'to defer' but fails to adequately explain the Saussurean background (synchronic difference) versus the temporal dimension (deferral), nor does it address the relationship to Heidegger's ontological difference",
        "The concepts of 'trace' and 'supplementarity' are barely mentioned despite being identified as key focus areas; supplementarity in particular\u2014central to the reading of Rousseau in Of Grammatology\u2014receives no substantive analysis",
        "The citation apparatus is woefully inadequate: only three sources are cited, none of which are Derrida's primary texts, and the references used (Maleuvre, Long, Schneider) are tangential to the core philosophical exposition; the Schneider reference on extraterrestrial life is particularly incongruous"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Substantially expand the analysis of diff\u00e9rance to include: (1) its relationship to Saussure's concept of differential value, (2) the temporal dimension of deferral and its connection to Husserl's analysis of time-consciousness, and (3) its relationship to Heidegger's ontological difference and the question of Being",
        "Add dedicated sections on 'trace' (archi-trace, the trace structure that precedes presence) and 'supplementarity' (the logic of the supplement in Rousseau, the dangerous supplement, how the supplement is both addition and substitution)",
        "Completely overhaul the citation apparatus: cite Derrida's primary texts directly (Of Grammatology, Speech and Phenomena, Writing and Difference, Margins of Philosophy), engage with major secondary literature (Gasch\u00e9's 'Tain of the Mirror', Bennington's work, Spivak's preface to Of Grammatology), and remove or minimize tangential references"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of Continental Philosophy and Phenomenology, this manuscript requires substantial revision before it could be considered a serious scholarly contribution. The most pressing concern is the treatment of Derrida's core concepts. Diff\u00e9rance is introduced but not adequately explicated: the manuscript should explain how diff\u00e9rance names the condition of possibility for signification itself, drawing on Saussure's insight that in language there are only differences without positive terms, while also incorporating the temporal dimension that Derrida derives from his reading of Husserl's phenomenology of internal time-consciousness. The relationship to Heidegger's destruction of metaphysics and the ontological difference is entirely absent. Similarly, the concept of the trace\u2014which names the 'always already' structure that precedes and makes possible any present moment or self-identical meaning\u2014receives no systematic treatment. The logic of supplementarity, absolutely central to Derrida's reading of Rousseau in Of Grammatology, is mentioned only in passing. The manuscript claims to address Derrida's engagement with Husserl, Heidegger, and Saussure, yet these engagements are gestured toward rather than analyzed. Speech and Phenomena, Derrida's most sustained engagement with Husserl and arguably his most rigorous early work, is mentioned but not examined. The critique of Saussure in Of Grammatology\u2014specifically how Saussure's phonocentrism contradicts his own differential theory of the sign\u2014deserves detailed exposition. The citation problem is severe: a manuscript on Derrida that does not cite Derrida is fundamentally compromised. The reliance on secondary sources that are themselves peripheral to Derrida scholarship (a review of Monolingualism, a theological response, an article on extraterrestrial life) suggests either unfamiliarity with the primary literature or an unusual methodological choice that is not justified. The manuscript would benefit from engagement with established Derrida scholarship: Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9's infrastructural reading, Geoffrey Bennington's systematic exposition, or the debates between Derrida and speech act theorists like Searle.",

    "meta_review": "The three reviewers demonstrate remarkable consistency in their assessments, converging on the same core concerns: (1) a woefully inadequate citation apparatus with only three sources, none of which are Derrida's primary texts or standard secondary scholarship; (2) significant gaps in coverage of later works and key concepts; and (3) insufficient engagement with intellectual-historical context and major controversies. These are substantive, legitimate concerns\u2014not nitpicking or unreasonable demands for a research report on a major philosopher. The reviewers are appropriately calibrated; one cannot write credibly about Derrida without citing Derrida, and the absence of engagement with foundational secondary literature (Bennington, Gasch\u00e9, Spivak's preface) represents a genuine scholarly deficiency rather than excessive rigor.\n\nThe manuscript does have real strengths that all reviewers acknowledge: clear, accessible prose; effective integration of biographical context with philosophical development; and accurate treatment of basic deconstructive concepts. These provide a solid foundation for revision. However, the weaknesses identified are not cosmetic\u2014they go to the heart of scholarly credibility. A research report that makes substantive claims about diff\u00e9rance without citing 'Speech and Phenomena' or 'Margins of Philosophy,' or that discusses Derrida's legacy without mentioning 'Specters of Marx' or the de Man affair, cannot meet publication standards regardless of how well-written it is.\n\nGiven this is Round 1 of 2, major revision is appropriate and achievable. The author has demonstrated competence in exposition and synthesis; what's needed is scholarly depth. The required changes are bounded and specific: expand the citation base to include primary sources and major secondary literature, add coverage of post-1990 works and key controversies, and deepen the technical analysis of core concepts. These are substantial but feasible revisions that would transform a competent introduction into a publishable research report.",

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their detailed, constructive feedback. The reviews converge on several critical points that we recognize as significant limitations requiring substantial revision: (1) inadequate coverage of Derrida's later ethical and political writings, (2) a severely underdeveloped citation apparatus that fails to engage with primary texts or major secondary scholarship, (3) insufficient intellectual-historical contextualization within French theory and the structuralist/post-structuralist moment, and (4) superficial treatment of core philosophical concepts including diff\u00e9rance, trace, and supplementarity.\n\nWe accept these criticisms as valid and are committed to a comprehensive revision that addresses each concern. Our revision strategy will involve three major undertakings: first, substantially expanding the manuscript to include dedicated sections on Derrida's post-1990 work and the \"ethical turn\"; second, completely overhauling the citation apparatus to include direct engagement with Derrida's primary texts and at least 15-20 scholarly sources representing current Derrida scholarship; and third, deepening the philosophical exposition of core concepts while situating them properly within their intellectual-historical context. We appreciate the reviewers' recognition of the manuscript's strengths\u2014particularly its accessible prose, biographical integration, and treatment of the Algerian context\u2014and will preserve these qualities while addressing the identified deficiencies.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Applications)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.2/10 and recognize that this reviewer has identified fundamental gaps in our manuscript's coverage of Derrida's interdisciplinary impact and later work. The characterization of our manuscript as presenting a \"troubling paradox\"\u2014gesturing toward broad influence without documenting it\u2014is apt and will guide our revisions.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Severely inadequate coverage of later ethical and political writings**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely justified. Our manuscript's near-exclusive focus on Derrida's early deconstructive work (pre-1980) presents an incomplete and distorted picture of his philosophical development. The \"ethical turn\" represented by works from the 1990s onward constitutes a major phase of Derrida's thought that we inexcusably neglected.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add two new substantial sections: (a) \"The Ethical Turn: Hospitality, the Gift, and Responsibility\" covering *The Gift of Death* (1995), *Of Hospitality* (1997), and the concept of unconditional hospitality versus conditional hospitality; and (b) \"Politics and Spectrality: Democracy to Come\" covering *Specters of Marx* (1993), the concept of hauntology, autoimmunity in *Rogues* (2003), and the messianic structure of \"democracy to come\" (d\u00e9mocratie \u00e0 venir). Each section will receive approximately 500-700 words of dedicated analysis.\n\n2. **Insufficient citation base (only three citations)**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. Three citations\u2014one of which is tangentially relevant\u2014cannot support a comprehensive research report on a major philosopher. This represents a serious methodological failure.\n   - **Action taken**: Our revised manuscript will include direct citations to Derrida's primary texts (*Of Grammatology*, *Writing and Difference*, *Speech and Phenomena*, *Margins of Philosophy*, *Specters of Marx*, *The Gift of Death*, *Of Hospitality*, *Rogues*) and engagement with major secondary literature including Geoffrey Bennington's *Jacques Derrida* (1993), John Caputo's *The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida* (1997), Simon Critchley's *The Ethics of Deconstruction* (1992), Gayatri Spivak's preface to *Of Grammatology*, and Judith Butler's engagements with Derrida. We commit to a minimum of 18-20 scholarly sources.\n\n3. **The Schneider reference is tangential and puzzling**\n   - **Our response**: We appreciate this observation. The Schneider reference was included to gesture toward Derrida's relevance for questions of alterity and non-human communication, but we acknowledge it is poorly integrated and does not effectively demonstrate Derrida's interdisciplinary impact.\n   - **Action taken**: We will either remove this reference entirely or substantially reconceptualize its inclusion within a new section on Derrida's influence across disciplines. We are inclined toward the former option, replacing it with scholarship that concretely demonstrates Derrida's impact on literary theory (the Yale School), postcolonial studies (Spivak), feminist theory (Butler), and legal studies (critical legal studies movement).\n\n4. **Absence of discussion of deconstruction's transformation of literary studies**\n   - **Our response**: This is a significant oversight given our manuscript's framing. The influence of deconstruction on American literary criticism through Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, Barbara Johnson, and the broader Yale School represents one of Derrida's most consequential interdisciplinary impacts.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated subsection on \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" that traces the institutional reception of Derrida's work in American English departments, the Yale School's development of deconstructive reading practices, and the subsequent debates about the politics of deconstruction in literary studies.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will ensure that our expanded discussion of hospitality adequately addresses its relevance for contemporary debates about migration, sovereignty, and ethics, as the reviewer suggests. We will also add concrete examples of deconstructive analysis in postcolonial theory and gender studies rather than merely asserting Derrida's influence.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Intellectual History and French Theory)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.2/10 and recognize that this reviewer has identified a fundamental problem with our manuscript: it presents a \"decontextualized portrait\" of Derrida that fails to situate his work within the French intellectual milieu that gave it meaning and urgency.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Almost complete absence of engagement with French intellectual context**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism strikes at a core deficiency in our manuscript. Understanding why Derrida's interventions mattered when they did requires understanding structuralism's dominance in 1960s French thought, the influence of Saussure and L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and the complex relationships among major figures of the period.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section titled \"Intellectual Context: Structuralism and Its Discontents\" that addresses: (a) the structuralist moment and the influence of Saussure, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and Jakobson; (b) Derrida's complex positioning vis-\u00e0-vis structuralism\u2014neither simply within nor against it; (c) his association with and distance from the Tel Quel group; (d) his relationship to other major figures including Foucault, Lacan, and Althusser; and (e) the famous debate with Foucault over Descartes and madness (\"Cogito and the History of Madness\").\n\n2. **Key controversies absent or superficially treated**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our treatment of the Cambridge affair lacks specificity and that our complete omission of the de Man affair and the Searle debate represents a serious gap in any account of Derrida's reception and intellectual legacy.\n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially revise and expand our \"Controversies and Reception\" section to include: (a) detailed treatment of the Cambridge affair with specific information (the 336-204 vote, the opposition letter organized by Barry Smith and signed by figures including Ruth Barcan Marcus, W.V. Quine, and others, and the specific objections raised); (b) a new subsection on the de Man affair\u2014the 1987 revelation of de Man's wartime writings for collaborationist publications and Derrida's controversial response in \"Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell,\" including discussion of the ethical questions this raised about deconstruction's relationship to politics and history; (c) the extended debate with John Searle over speech act theory, culminating in *Limited Inc* (1988), which remains essential for understanding Derrida's theory of iterability.\n\n3. **Inadequate citation apparatus with no primary sources**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The absence of direct citations to Derrida's own texts is a fundamental scholarly failure that undermines our manuscript's credibility.\n   - **Action taken**: As noted above, we will completely overhaul our citation apparatus. For intellectual-historical claims specifically, we will cite Beno\u00eet Peeters' authoritative biography *Derrida* (2010), Edward Baring's *The Young Derrida and French Philosophy* (2011), and Fran\u00e7ois Cusset's *French Theory* (2008) for the American reception. Claims about specific events (Vichy laws, ENS admission, the 1967 publications, the Cambridge vote) will be properly sourced.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will ensure that our revised discussion of Derrida's relationship to phenomenology in France adequately addresses the institutional and intellectual context of his early career, including his position at the ENS and his relationships with figures like Jean Hyppolite and Maurice de Gandillac.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Continental Philosophy and Phenomenology)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.0/10 and recognize that this reviewer has identified critical deficiencies in our treatment of Derrida's core philosophical concepts. The observation that our exposition \"lacks the technical precision required for serious scholarly work\" is a fair assessment that we are committed to addressing.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Superficial treatment of diff\u00e9rance**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that our exposition of diff\u00e9rance is inadequate. We mentioned the \"to differ\" and \"to defer\" dimensions but failed to provide the systematic analysis this concept requires, including its relationship to Saussure's differential theory of value, Husserl's phenomenology of time-consciousness, and Heidegger's ontological difference.\n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand our treatment of diff\u00e9rance to include: (a) detailed exposition of its Saussurean background\u2014how Saussure's insight that \"in language there are only differences without positive terms\" provides the synchronic dimension of diff\u00e9rance; (b) the temporal dimension of deferral derived from Derrida's reading of Husserl's analysis of internal time-consciousness in *Speech and Phenomena*, showing how presence is always already constituted through retention and protention; (c) the relationship to Heidegger's ontological difference and the question of Being, while noting Derrida's critical distance from Heideggerian nostalgia; (d) explanation of how diff\u00e9rance names the condition of possibility for signification itself while remaining irreducible to any concept.\n\n2. **Trace and supplementarity barely mentioned despite being identified as key concepts**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely valid. We identified these as key concepts but failed to deliver substantive analysis, which represents a significant failure to meet our own stated objectives.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add dedicated subsections on: (a) \"The Trace and Archi-Writing\"\u2014explaining how the trace names the structure of \"always already\" that precedes and makes possible any present moment or self-identical meaning, and how archi-writing (archi-\u00e9criture) is not empirical writing but the condition of possibility for both speech and writing; (b) \"The Logic of the Supplement\"\u2014providing detailed analysis of supplementarity as developed in *Of Grammatology*'s reading of Rousseau, explaining how the supplement is simultaneously addition and substitution, how it reveals that what it supplements was never complete or self-sufficient, and how this logic undermines the nature/culture, inside/outside oppositions.\n\n3. **Engagement with Husserl, Heidegger, and Saussure remains superficial**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our manuscript gestures toward these engagements without adequately analyzing them. Given that Derrida's early work is fundamentally constituted through critical readings of these figures, this represents a serious deficiency.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a section titled \"Critical Engagements: Husserl, Heidegger, Saussure\" that provides: (a) analysis of *Speech and Phenomena* as Derrida's most sustained engagement with Husserl, focusing on the critique of the \"living present\" and the voice as self-presence; (b) examination of Derrida's relationship to Heidegger\u2014both his debt to Heideggerian destruction of metaphysics and his critical distance from what he saw as Heidegger's residual nostalgia for authentic origin; (c) detailed exposition of the critique of Saussure in *Of Grammatology*, specifically how Saussure's phonocentrism (privileging speech over writing) contradicts his own differential theory of the sign.\n\n4. **Citation apparatus is \"woefully inadequate\"**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this characterization. A manuscript on Derrida that does not cite Derrida is, as the reviewer states, \"fundamentally compromised.\"\n   - **Action taken**: Our revised manuscript will cite Derrida's primary texts directly and extensively. For the philosophical exposition specifically, we will engage with Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9's *The Tain of the Mirror* (1986) for its rigorous analysis of Derrida's \"infrastructures,\" Geoffrey Bennington's systematic exposition in *Jacques Derrida* (1993), and Gayatri Spivak's translator's preface to *Of Grammatology* (1976). We will remove or substantially minimize the tangential Schneider reference.\n\n**Minor Points**: We appreciate the reviewer's acknowledgment of our manuscript's accessible prose and will maintain this quality while adding the necessary technical precision. We will also ensure that our revised discussion of the 1967 publications provides adequate analysis of each text's specific contribution rather than treating them as an undifferentiated whole.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Structural Additions**:\n- New section: \"The Ethical Turn: Hospitality, the Gift, and Responsibility\" (500-700 words)\n- New section: \"Politics and Spectrality: Democracy to Come\" (500-700 words)\n- New section: \"Intellectual Context: Structuralism and Its Discontents\" (400-500 words)\n- New section: \"Critical Engagements: Husserl, Heidegger, Saussure\" (500-600 words)\n- New subsection: \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" (300-400 words)\n- Substantially expanded \"Controversies and Reception\" section including the de Man affair and Searle debate\n\n**Major Conceptual Expansions**:\n- Comprehensive revision of diff\u00e9rance exposition with Saussurean, Husserlian, and Heideggerian dimensions\n- New dedicated analysis of trace and archi-writing\n- New dedicated analysis of supplementarity and the logic of the supplement\n- Detailed treatment of the Cambridge affair with specific figures and vote counts\n\n**Citation Apparatus Overhaul**:\n- Direct citations to Derrida's primary texts (minimum 8-10 works)\n- Engagement with major secondary scholarship (Bennington, Gasch\u00e9, Caputo, Critchley, Spivak, Butler, Peeters)\n- Removal or substantial reconceptualization of tangential Schneider reference\n- Total citations expanded from 3 to minimum 18-20 scholarly sources\n\n**Clarifications and Refinements**:\n- More precise technical vocabulary for philosophical concepts\n- Concrete examples of Derrida's interdisciplinary influence rather than mere assertion\n- Proper sourcing for all historical and biographical claims\n\nWe anticipate these revisions will approximately double the manuscript's length while substantially improving its scholarly rigor, comprehensiveness, and value to readers across disciplines. We are grateful to the reviewers for their thorough engagement with our work and believe these revisions will address their legitimate concerns.",
