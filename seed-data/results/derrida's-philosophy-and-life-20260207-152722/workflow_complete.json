          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of literary theory and interdisciplinary applications, this manuscript presents a troubling paradox: it gestures toward Derrida's broad influence while failing to document or analyze that influence in any substantive way. The claim that Derrida's concepts 'have become part of the common vocabulary of contemporary theory' is asserted but never demonstrated through engagement with actual literary or cultural criticism. Where is the discussion of how deconstruction transformed literary studies through figures like Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, and the Yale School? Where is the engagement with Spivak's deconstructive postcolonialism or Butler's deconstructive feminism? The manuscript's treatment of Derrida's later work is particularly deficient. The concept of 'specters' and spectrality\u2014central to Derrida's engagement with Marx and enormously influential in cultural studies, hauntology, and memory studies\u2014receives no attention. The 'democracy to come' (d\u00e9mocratie \u00e0 venir), arguably Derrida's most significant contribution to political philosophy, is mentioned only in passing without explication. The discussion of hospitality, while present, lacks the depth needed to convey its importance for contemporary debates about migration, sovereignty, and ethics. The citation apparatus is inadequate for a scholarly research report. Three sources\u2014one of which (Schneider) is only tangentially relevant\u2014cannot support the breadth of claims made here. The absence of engagement with Derrida's own primary texts (no direct citations to 'Of Grammatology,' 'Writing and Difference,' etc.) and with the substantial body of Derrida scholarship published over the past three decades significantly undermines the manuscript's authority. I would recommend this manuscript be substantially revised to include: (1) dedicated sections on the ethical turn and political writings; (2) concrete examples of Derrida's influence on literary criticism, postcolonial theory, gender studies, and legal theory; (3) engagement with at least 15-20 scholarly sources representing the current state of Derrida scholarship.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of intellectual history, this manuscript presents a fundamentally decontextualized portrait of Derrida. While the biographical section on Algeria is competent, it fails to situate Derrida within the specific intellectual milieu that shaped his work. The 1960s French intellectual scene\u2014dominated by structuralism, the influence of Saussure and L\u00e9vi-Strauss, the debates around Marxism and psychoanalysis\u2014is essential context for understanding why Derrida's interventions mattered when they did. The manuscript mentions Saussure but does not explain Derrida's position relative to the structuralist movement or his complex relationship to figures like L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Barthes, and Lacan. The Tel Quel group, with which Derrida was associated in the late 1960s before distancing himself, goes entirely unmentioned. Similarly, the famous debate with Foucault over the Cogito and madness in Descartes\u2014a defining moment in French theory\u2014is absent. The treatment of controversies is particularly deficient for a research report claiming to examine Derrida's reception. The Cambridge affair is mentioned but without the specificity required: the actual vote was 336 to 204, the opposition letter was signed by figures including Barry Smith and Ruth Barcan Marcus, and the affair crystallized long-standing tensions between analytic and continental philosophy. More seriously, the de Man affair\u2014the revelation of Paul de Man's wartime collaborationist writings and Derrida's controversial defense\u2014is entirely absent, despite being arguably the most significant controversy affecting Derrida's reputation. The Searle debate, which produced 'Limited Inc' and remains central to understanding Derrida's theory of iterability and speech acts, is also missing. The citation apparatus is inadequate for scholarly work on this topic. The three sources cited are tangential: a review essay, a theological response, and a paper on extraterrestrial life. None of Derrida's own works are cited directly, nor are standard scholarly treatments. Claims about the Vichy laws, the ENS admission, the 1967 publications, and the Cambridge vote all require proper citation to primary or authoritative secondary sources.",

          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of Continental Philosophy and Phenomenology, this manuscript requires substantial revision before it could be considered a serious scholarly contribution. The most pressing concern is the treatment of Derrida's core concepts. Diff\u00e9rance is introduced but not adequately explicated: the manuscript should explain how diff\u00e9rance names the condition of possibility for signification itself, drawing on Saussure's insight that in language there are only differences without positive terms, while also incorporating the temporal dimension that Derrida derives from his reading of Husserl's phenomenology of internal time-consciousness. The relationship to Heidegger's destruction of metaphysics and the ontological difference is entirely absent. Similarly, the concept of the trace\u2014which names the 'always already' structure that precedes and makes possible any present moment or self-identical meaning\u2014receives no systematic treatment. The logic of supplementarity, absolutely central to Derrida's reading of Rousseau in Of Grammatology, is mentioned only in passing. The manuscript claims to address Derrida's engagement with Husserl, Heidegger, and Saussure, yet these engagements are gestured toward rather than analyzed. Speech and Phenomena, Derrida's most sustained engagement with Husserl and arguably his most rigorous early work, is mentioned but not examined. The critique of Saussure in Of Grammatology\u2014specifically how Saussure's phonocentrism contradicts his own differential theory of the sign\u2014deserves detailed exposition. The citation problem is severe: a manuscript on Derrida that does not cite Derrida is fundamentally compromised. The reliance on secondary sources that are themselves peripheral to Derrida scholarship (a review of Monolingualism, a theological response, an article on extraterrestrial life) suggests either unfamiliarity with the primary literature or an unusual methodological choice that is not justified. The manuscript would benefit from engagement with established Derrida scholarship: Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9's infrastructural reading, Geoffrey Bennington's systematic exposition, or the debates between Derrida and speech act theorists like Searle.",

These are substantive, legitimate concerns\u2014not nitpicking or unreasonable demands for a research report on a major philosopher. The reviewers are appropriately calibrated; one cannot write credibly about Derrida without citing Derrida, and the absence of engagement with foundational secondary literature (Bennington, Gasch\u00e9, Spivak's preface) represents a genuine scholarly deficiency rather than excessive rigor.\n\nThe manuscript does have real strengths that all reviewers acknowledge: clear, accessible prose; effective integration of biographical context with philosophical development; and accurate treatment of basic deconstructive concepts. These provide a solid foundation for revision. However, the weaknesses identified are not cosmetic\u2014they go to the heart of scholarly credibility. A research report that makes substantive claims about diff\u00e9rance without citing 'Speech and Phenomena' or 'Margins of Philosophy,' or that discusses Derrida's legacy without mentioning 'Specters of Marx' or the de Man affair, cannot meet publication standards regardless of how well-written it is.\n\nGiven this is Round 1 of 2, major revision is appropriate and achievable. The author has demonstrated competence in exposition and synthesis; what's needed is scholarly depth. The required changes are bounded and specific: expand the citation base to include primary sources and major secondary literature, add coverage of post-1990 works and key controversies, and deepen the technical analysis of core concepts.

      "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their detailed, constructive feedback. The reviews converge on several critical points that we recognize as significant limitations requiring substantial revision: (1) inadequate coverage of Derrida's later ethical and political writings, (2) a severely underdeveloped citation apparatus that fails to engage with primary texts or major secondary scholarship, (3) insufficient intellectual-historical contextualization within French theory and the structuralist/post-structuralist moment, and (4) superficial treatment of core philosophical concepts including diff\u00e9rance, trace, and supplementarity.\n\nWe accept these criticisms as valid and are committed to a comprehensive revision that addresses each concern. Our revision strategy will involve three major undertakings: first, substantially expanding the manuscript to include dedicated sections on Derrida's post-1990 work and the \"ethical turn\"; second, completely overhauling the citation apparatus to include direct engagement with Derrida's primary texts and at least 15-20 scholarly sources representing current Derrida scholarship; and third, deepening the philosophical exposition of core concepts while situating them properly within their intellectual-historical context. We appreciate the reviewers' recognition of the manuscript's strengths\u2014particularly its accessible prose, biographical integration, and treatment of the Algerian context\u2014and will preserve these qualities while addressing the identified deficiencies.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Applications)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.2/10 and recognize that this reviewer has identified fundamental gaps in our manuscript's coverage of Derrida's interdisciplinary impact and later work. The characterization of our manuscript as presenting a \"troubling paradox\"\u2014gesturing toward broad influence without documenting it\u2014is apt and will guide our revisions.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Severely inadequate coverage of later ethical and political writings**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely justified. Our manuscript's near-exclusive focus on Derrida's early deconstructive work (pre-1980) presents an incomplete and distorted picture of his philosophical development. The \"ethical turn\" represented by works from the 1990s onward constitutes a major phase of Derrida's thought that we inexcusably neglected.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add two new substantial sections: (a) \"The Ethical Turn: Hospitality, the Gift, and Responsibility\" covering *The Gift of Death* (1995), *Of Hospitality* (1997), and the concept of unconditional hospitality versus conditional hospitality; and (b) \"Politics and Spectrality: Democracy to Come\" covering *Specters of Marx* (1993), the concept of hauntology, autoimmunity in *Rogues* (2003), and the messianic structure of \"democracy to come\" (d\u00e9mocratie \u00e0 venir). Each section will receive approximately 500-700 words of dedicated analysis.\n\n2. **Insufficient citation base (only three citations)**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. Three citations\u2014one of which is tangentially relevant\u2014cannot support a comprehensive research report on a major philosopher. This represents a serious methodological failure.\n   - **Action taken**: Our revised manuscript will include direct citations to Derrida's primary texts (*Of Grammatology*, *Writing and Difference*, *Speech and Phenomena*, *Margins of Philosophy*, *Specters of Marx*, *The Gift of Death*, *Of Hospitality*, *Rogues*) and engagement with major secondary literature including Geoffrey Bennington's *Jacques Derrida* (1993), John Caputo's *The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida* (1997), Simon Critchley's *The Ethics of Deconstruction* (1992), Gayatri Spivak's preface to *Of Grammatology*, and Judith Butler's engagements with Derrida. We commit to a minimum of 18-20 scholarly sources.\n\n3. **The Schneider reference is tangential and puzzling**\n   - **Our response**: We appreciate this observation. The Schneider reference was included to gesture toward Derrida's relevance for questions of alterity and non-human communication, but we acknowledge it is poorly integrated and does not effectively demonstrate Derrida's interdisciplinary impact.\n   - **Action taken**: We will either remove this reference entirely or substantially reconceptualize its inclusion within a new section on Derrida's influence across disciplines. We are inclined toward the former option, replacing it with scholarship that concretely demonstrates Derrida's impact on literary theory (the Yale School), postcolonial studies (Spivak), feminist theory (Butler), and legal studies (critical legal studies movement).\n\n4. **Absence of discussion of deconstruction's transformation of literary studies**\n   - **Our response**: This is a significant oversight given our manuscript's framing. The influence of deconstruction on American literary criticism through Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, Barbara Johnson, and the broader Yale School represents one of Derrida's most consequential interdisciplinary impacts.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated subsection on \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" that traces the institutional reception of Derrida's work in American English departments, the Yale School's development of deconstructive reading practices, and the subsequent debates about the politics of deconstruction in literary studies.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will ensure that our expanded discussion of hospitality adequately addresses its relevance for contemporary debates about migration, sovereignty, and ethics, as the reviewer suggests. We will also add concrete examples of deconstructive analysis in postcolonial theory and gender studies rather than merely asserting Derrida's influence.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Intellectual History and French Theory)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.2/10 and recognize that this reviewer has identified a fundamental problem with our manuscript: it presents a \"decontextualized portrait\" of Derrida that fails to situate his work within the French intellectual milieu that gave it meaning and urgency.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Almost complete absence of engagement with French intellectual context**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism strikes at a core deficiency in our manuscript. Understanding why Derrida's interventions mattered when they did requires understanding structuralism's dominance in 1960s French thought, the influence of Saussure and L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and the complex relationships among major figures of the period.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section titled \"Intellectual Context: Structuralism and Its Discontents\" that addresses: (a) the structuralist moment and the influence of Saussure, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and Jakobson; (b) Derrida's complex positioning vis-\u00e0-vis structuralism\u2014neither simply within nor against it; (c) his association with and distance from the Tel Quel group; (d) his relationship to other major figures including Foucault, Lacan, and Althusser; and (e) the famous debate with Foucault over Descartes and madness (\"Cogito and the History of Madness\").\n\n2. **Key controversies absent or superficially treated**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our treatment of the Cambridge affair lacks specificity and that our complete omission of the de Man affair and the Searle debate represents a serious gap in any account of Derrida's reception and intellectual legacy.\n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially revise and expand our \"Controversies and Reception\" section to include: (a) detailed treatment of the Cambridge affair with specific information (the 336-204 vote, the opposition letter organized by Barry Smith and signed by figures including Ruth Barcan Marcus, W.V. Quine, and others, and the specific objections raised); (b) a new subsection on the de Man affair\u2014the 1987 revelation of de Man's wartime writings for collaborationist publications and Derrida's controversial response in \"Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell,\" including discussion of the ethical questions this raised about deconstruction's relationship to politics and history; (c) the extended debate with John Searle over speech act theory, culminating in *Limited Inc* (1988), which remains essential for understanding Derrida's theory of iterability.\n\n3. **Inadequate citation apparatus with no primary sources**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The absence of direct citations to Derrida's own texts is a fundamental scholarly failure that undermines our manuscript's credibility.\n   - **Action taken**: As noted above, we will completely overhaul our citation apparatus. For intellectual-historical claims specifically, we will cite Beno\u00eet Peeters' authoritative biography *Derrida* (2010), Edward Baring's *The Young Derrida and French Philosophy* (2011), and Fran\u00e7ois Cusset's *French Theory* (2008) for the American reception. Claims about specific events (Vichy laws, ENS admission, the 1967 publications, the Cambridge vote) will be properly sourced.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will ensure that our revised discussion of Derrida's relationship to phenomenology in France adequately addresses the institutional and intellectual context of his early career, including his position at the ENS and his relationships with figures like Jean Hyppolite and Maurice de Gandillac.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Continental Philosophy and Phenomenology)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.0/10 and recognize that this reviewer has identified critical deficiencies in our treatment of Derrida's core philosophical concepts. The observation that our exposition \"lacks the technical precision required for serious scholarly work\" is a fair assessment that we are committed to addressing.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Superficial treatment of diff\u00e9rance**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that our exposition of diff\u00e9rance is inadequate. We mentioned the \"to differ\" and \"to defer\" dimensions but failed to provide the systematic analysis this concept requires, including its relationship to Saussure's differential theory of value, Husserl's phenomenology of time-consciousness, and Heidegger's ontological difference.\n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand our treatment of diff\u00e9rance to include: (a) detailed exposition of its Saussurean background\u2014how Saussure's insight that \"in language there are only differences without positive terms\" provides the synchronic dimension of diff\u00e9rance; (b) the temporal dimension of deferral derived from Derrida's reading of Husserl's analysis of internal time-consciousness in *Speech and Phenomena*, showing how presence is always already constituted through retention and protention; (c) the relationship to Heidegger's ontological difference and the question of Being, while noting Derrida's critical distance from Heideggerian nostalgia; (d) explanation of how diff\u00e9rance names the condition of possibility for signification itself while remaining irreducible to any concept.\n\n2. **Trace and supplementarity barely mentioned despite being identified as key concepts**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely valid. We identified these as key concepts but failed to deliver substantive analysis, which represents a significant failure to meet our own stated objectives.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add dedicated subsections on: (a) \"The Trace and Archi-Writing\"\u2014explaining how the trace names the structure of \"always already\" that precedes and makes possible any present moment or self-identical meaning, and how archi-writing (archi-\u00e9criture) is not empirical writing but the condition of possibility for both speech and writing; (b) \"The Logic of the Supplement\"\u2014providing detailed analysis of supplementarity as developed in *Of Grammatology*'s reading of Rousseau, explaining how the supplement is simultaneously addition and substitution, how it reveals that what it supplements was never complete or self-sufficient, and how this logic undermines the nature/culture, inside/outside oppositions.\n\n3. **Engagement with Husserl, Heidegger, and Saussure remains superficial**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our manuscript gestures toward these engagements without adequately analyzing them. Given that Derrida's early work is fundamentally constituted through critical readings of these figures, this represents a serious deficiency.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a section titled \"Critical Engagements: Husserl, Heidegger, Saussure\" that provides: (a) analysis of *Speech and Phenomena* as Derrida's most sustained engagement with Husserl, focusing on the critique of the \"living present\" and the voice as self-presence; (b) examination of Derrida's relationship to Heidegger\u2014both his debt to Heideggerian destruction of metaphysics and his critical distance from what he saw as Heidegger's residual nostalgia for authentic origin; (c) detailed exposition of the critique of Saussure in *Of Grammatology*, specifically how Saussure's phonocentrism (privileging speech over writing) contradicts his own differential theory of the sign.\n\n4. **Citation apparatus is \"woefully inadequate\"**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this characterization. A manuscript on Derrida that does not cite Derrida is, as the reviewer states, \"fundamentally compromised.\"\n   - **Action taken**: Our revised manuscript will cite Derrida's primary texts directly and extensively. For the philosophical exposition specifically, we will engage with Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9's *The Tain of the Mirror* (1986) for its rigorous analysis of Derrida's \"infrastructures,\" Geoffrey Bennington's systematic exposition in *Jacques Derrida* (1993), and Gayatri Spivak's translator's preface to *Of Grammatology* (1976). We will remove or substantially minimize the tangential Schneider reference.\n\n**Minor Points**: We appreciate the reviewer's acknowledgment of our manuscript's accessible prose and will maintain this quality while adding the necessary technical precision. We will also ensure that our revised discussion of the 1967 publications provides adequate analysis of each text's specific contribution rather than treating them as an undifferentiated whole.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Structural Additions**:\n- New section: \"The Ethical Turn: Hospitality, the Gift, and Responsibility\" (500-700 words)\n- New section: \"Politics and Spectrality: Democracy to Come\" (500-700 words)\n- New section: \"Intellectual Context: Structuralism and Its Discontents\" (400-500 words)\n- New section: \"Critical Engagements: Husserl, Heidegger, Saussure\" (500-600 words)\n- New subsection: \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" (300-400 words)\n- Substantially expanded \"Controversies and Reception\" section including the de Man affair and Searle debate\n\n**Major Conceptual Expansions**:\n- Comprehensive revision of diff\u00e9rance exposition with Saussurean, Husserlian, and Heideggerian dimensions\n- New dedicated analysis of trace and archi-writing\n- New dedicated analysis of supplementarity and the logic of the supplement\n- Detailed treatment of the Cambridge affair with specific figures and vote counts\n\n**Citation Apparatus Overhaul**:\n- Direct citations to Derrida's primary texts (minimum 8-10 works)\n- Engagement with major secondary scholarship (Bennington, Gasch\u00e9, Caputo, Critchley, Spivak, Butler, Peeters)\n- Removal or substantial reconceptualization of tangential Schneider reference\n- Total citations expanded from 3 to minimum 18-20 scholarly sources\n\n**Clarifications and Refinements**:\n- More precise technical vocabulary for philosophical concepts\n- Concrete examples of Derrida's interdisciplinary influence rather than mere assertion\n- Proper sourcing for all historical and biographical claims\n\nWe anticipate these revisions will approximately double the manuscript's length while substantially improving its scholarly rigor, comprehensiveness, and value to readers across disciplines. We are grateful to the reviewers for their thorough engagement with our work and believe these revisions will address their legitimate concerns.",

          "detailed_feedback": "As a reviewer focused on literary theory and interdisciplinary applications, I must note a significant discrepancy between the authors' response and the actual revision.

The revised manuscript contains exactly two citations\u2014Maleuvre and Long\u2014neither of which represents the promised engagement with major Derrida scholarship. This is a serious failure to implement stated revisions. The content improvements are genuine: the new material on hospitality effectively distinguishes conditional from unconditional hospitality, the discussion of 'democracy to come' captures its structural rather than teleological character, and the hauntology section appropriately contextualizes Specters of Marx. The de Man affair and Searle debate are now addressed. However, without proper citations, these improvements cannot be verified against the scholarly record. The claim that Spivak and Butler represent 'prominent examples' of Derrida's influence remains unsupported by any citation to their actual work. The promised subsection on 'Deconstruction and Literary Criticism' (300-400 words) appears only as a single sentence mentioning the Yale School. For a manuscript claiming to assess Derrida's impact on literary and cultural studies, this remains a critical gap. I cannot in good conscience raise my score substantially when the most fundamental scholarly apparatus\u2014the citation base\u2014remains essentially unchanged from the first submission.",

The conceptual exposition has improved markedly: the treatment of diff\u00e9rance now properly triangulates between Saussure's differential theory of value, Husserl's phenomenology of time-consciousness, and Heidegger's ontological difference. The observation that the silent 'a' in diff\u00e9rance 'performs the very priority of writing' is apt. The sections on trace and supplementarity, while still somewhat schematic, now provide the substantive analysis that was entirely lacking before. However, the most serious deficiency\u2014the citation apparatus\u2014has not been addressed at all. The authors explicitly committed to citing Derrida's primary texts directly and engaging with major secondary literature (Gasch\u00e9, Bennington, Spivak), yet the revision contains only two citations, both to secondary sources tangential to the core philosophical exposition. This is not merely a formal problem: without direct engagement with Derrida's texts, claims about what he argues remain unverifiable assertions. For instance, the discussion of Speech and Phenomena would benefit enormously from quoting Derrida's actual analysis of Husserl's concept of Bedeutung and the 'solitary mental life.' Similarly, the supplementarity discussion should cite specific passages from Of Grammatology's reading of Rousseau. The philosophical content has improved from inadequate to competent, but the scholarly apparatus has not improved at all, which significantly undermines the manuscript's credibility as a research document.",

Where is Peeters' biography for biographical claims? Where is Gasch\u00e9's 'Tain of the Mirror' for the discussion of infrastructures? Where is any citation to Derrida's own texts? Claims about what Derrida argues in 'Speech and Phenomena' or 'Of Grammatology' require citations to those works. The manuscript makes numerous specific claims\u2014about the 1940 expulsion, the ENS admission in 1952, the 1967 publications, the Cambridge vote\u2014that require proper sourcing.

        "meta_review": "This manuscript on Derrida presents a genuine editorial dilemma. The authors have demonstrably improved the substantive philosophical content: the treatment of diff\u00e9rance now properly engages Saussure, Husserl, and Heidegger; new sections on trace, supplementarity, hospitality, and 'democracy to come' address major gaps; and the coverage of controversies (Cambridge affair, de Man) is now appropriately detailed. The 0.8-point improvement reflects real intellectual work, and all three reviewers acknowledge these gains. The prose remains clear and accessible\u2014no small achievement when explaining Derrida.\n\nHowever, I cannot overlook the central failure: the authors explicitly committed to overhauling the citation apparatus with 18-20 sources, including primary Derrida texts and major secondary scholarship (Gasch\u00e9, Bennington, Spivak, Caputo). They delivered two tangential citations. This is not a minor oversight\u2014it represents a fundamental breach of the revision commitment. For a philosophical reference work, citations are not decorative; they ground claims, enable verification, and situate the work within scholarly discourse. A manuscript about Derrida that cites no Derrida is structurally deficient, regardless of how competently it summarizes his ideas.\n\nThe reviewers are not being unreasonable here. They are not demanding novel research or theoretical innovation\u2014they are asking for basic scholarly apparatus that the authors themselves promised. This is a fixable problem, but it requires actual implementation, not another round of promises. Given that this is the final round, I am reluctant to reject outright given the genuine content improvements, but I cannot accept a manuscript that fails to meet the minimum citation standards for academic philosophy.

      "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript and for their careful assessment of our revisions. We are gratified that the reviewers recognize the substantial content improvements made in Round 1, including the expanded treatment of diff\u00e9rance, the new sections on trace and supplementarity, the coverage of Derrida's later ethical and political work (hospitality, democracy to come, hauntology), and the improved discussion of controversies including the Cambridge affair and de Man affair.\n\nHowever, we must acknowledge a serious failure on our part: despite our explicit commitment in the Round 1 response to overhaul the citation apparatus with 18-20 scholarly sources including primary Derrida texts and major secondary literature, we did not implement these changes. All three reviewers have rightly identified this as a critical deficiency that undermines the credibility of our manuscript. We offer no excuses for this oversight and commit to rectifying it fully in this revision. We also acknowledge the remaining gaps in our treatment of literary criticism, the Searle debate, and the Foucault relationship. Below, we provide detailed responses to each reviewer and a comprehensive plan for revision.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Applications)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 1's acknowledgment of the genuine content improvements while recognizing that their overall score of 5.7/10 reflects the critical failure to implement our promised citation overhaul. The citation score of 3/10 is entirely justified given the discrepancy between our stated commitments and actual revisions.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation apparatus remains fundamentally inadequate despite explicit promises**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. Our failure to implement the promised citations represents a serious breach of trust with the reviewers. There is no justification for this oversight, and we take full responsibility.\n   - **Action taken**: We will now implement the citation overhaul in full. The revised manuscript will include:\n     - Primary Derrida texts: *Of Grammatology* (1967), *Speech and Phenomena* (1967), *Writing and Difference* (1967), *Margins of Philosophy* (1972), *Limited Inc* (1988), *Specters of Marx* (1993), *Of Hospitality* (1997), and *Rogues* (2003), with specific page references for all substantive claims\n     - Secondary scholarship: Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's translator's preface to *Of Grammatology*; Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9's *The Tain of the Mirror* (1986); Geoffrey Bennington's contributions to *Jacques Derrida* (1991); John Caputo's *Deconstruction in a Nutshell* (1997); Simon Critchley's *The Ethics of Deconstruction* (1992); Beno\u00eet Peeters' *Derrida: A Biography* (2010)\n     - Interdisciplinary applications: Spivak's \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" (1988); Butler's *Gender Trouble* (1990); critical legal studies sources demonstrating concrete influence\n     - The Maleuvre and Long citations will be retained where appropriate but supplemented with this more robust scholarly apparatus\n\n2. **Promised subsection on \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" not delivered**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that our promised 300-400 word dedicated subsection appears only as a single sentence. This was another failure to implement stated revisions.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated subsection (350-400 words) titled \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" that traces:\n     - The institutional reception through the Yale School (Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman, Harold Bloom)\n     - Barbara Johnson's work on close reading and deconstruction\n     - The transformation of literary studies methodology in the 1970s-80s\n     - Specific examples of deconstructive reading practices with citations to primary critical texts\n\n3. **Interdisciplinary influence asserted but not demonstrated with citations**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that claims about Spivak and Butler's engagement with Derrida require direct citation to their work, not mere assertion.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add concrete examples with proper citations:\n     - Spivak's \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" with analysis of how she deploys deconstructive strategies\n     - Butler's *Gender Trouble* with specific discussion of how she draws on Derrida's critique of origins\n     - Critical legal studies: Roberto Unger and Duncan Kennedy's use of deconstructive methods, with appropriate citations\n\n**Minor Points**: We will remove the Schneider reference entirely (as noted, it was removed but not adequately replaced) and ensure all citations directly support claims about Derrida's influence.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Continental Philosophy and Phenomenology)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 2 for recognizing the substantial improvements in our exposition of diff\u00e9rance, trace, and supplementarity, and for the fair assessment reflected in the 6.0/10 score. We accept that the citation failure (3/10) prevents a higher overall evaluation.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation apparatus \"catastrophically inadequate\" with no primary Derrida texts cited**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this characterization. A manuscript making claims about Derrida's arguments in *Speech and Phenomena* or *Of Grammatology* without citing those texts lacks basic scholarly credibility.\n   - **Action taken**: As detailed above, we will cite all major primary texts with page references. For the philosophical exposition specifically:\n     - *Speech and Phenomena*: citations for the critique of Husserl's \"living present,\" the analysis of *Bedeutung*, and the \"solitary mental life\" discussion\n     - *Of Grammatology*: citations for the Rousseau reading, the \"dangerous supplement\" analysis, and the critique of phonocentrism\n     - *Margins of Philosophy*: citation for \"Diff\u00e9rance\" essay with specific page references for the Saussure, Husserl, and Heidegger triangulation\n     - Gasch\u00e9's *The Tain of the Mirror* will be cited for the analysis of \"infrastructures\" and the relationship between deconstruction and transcendental philosophy\n\n2. **Speech and Phenomena treatment lacks technical precision on the \"living present\"**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that mentioning retention/protention without adequately developing the analysis weakens the philosophical exposition.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand this section (approximately 150-200 additional words) to explain:\n     - How Husserl's analysis of time-consciousness requires retention (just-past) and protention (just-about-to-be) as constitutive of the present moment\n     - How this necessary structure means the present is always already divided, never simply self-identical\n     - How this undermines the phenomenological project of grounding knowledge in the self-presence of consciousness\n     - Direct quotation from Derrida's text demonstrating the argument\n\n3. **Supplementarity discussion summarizes conclusions without showing the argument**\n   - **Our response**: This is a valid criticism. Philosophical exposition should demonstrate argumentative logic, not merely report conclusions.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add textual analysis (150-200 words) that:\n     - Quotes specific passages from Derrida's reading of Rousseau on writing as \"dangerous supplement\"\n     - Shows how the supplement is both addition (external, inessential) and substitution (taking the place of what it supplements)\n     - Demonstrates how this logic reveals that what appears primary (speech, nature, presence) is always already supplemented\n     - Includes page references to *Of Grammatology* Part II\n\n**Minor Points**: We will ensure that the engagement with Bennington and Spivak's translator's preface is substantive rather than merely nominal, with specific discussion of their interpretive contributions.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Intellectual History and French Theory)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 3's recognition of the substantial improvements in intellectual-historical contextualization and controversy coverage. The 6.0/10 score fairly reflects genuine content improvement alongside the critical citation failure.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation apparatus remains critically underdeveloped despite promises**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. Claims about biographical facts, institutional history, and intellectual debates require proper sourcing.\n   - **Action taken**: In addition to the primary and secondary sources listed above, we will add:\n     - Peeters' *Derrida: A Biography* for all biographical claims (1940 expulsion, ENS admission, 1967 publications)\n     - Fran\u00e7ois Cusset's *French Theory* (2008) for the American reception\n     - Proper documentation for the Cambridge affair including contemporary accounts\n     - Citations for claims about the de Man affair and Derrida's response \"Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell\"\n\n2. **Searle debate mentioned but not substantively analyzed**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that introducing iterability without explaining the philosophical stakes leaves the discussion incomplete.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand the Searle debate section (200-250 additional words) to explain:\n     - Austin's speech act theory and the distinction between serious and parasitic utterances\n     - Derrida's critique in \"Signature Event Context\": iterability as the condition of possibility for any sign\n     - Searle's response defending the determinacy of illocutionary force\n     - Derrida's reply in \"Limited Inc a b c...\" and the philosophical stakes regarding context, intention, and meaning\n     - Citations to *Limited Inc* and relevant secondary literature\n\n3. **Foucault relationship gestured toward but not developed**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that a single sentence on the 1963 lecture is inadequate treatment of a significant intellectual exchange.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated paragraph (150-200 words) on the Derrida-Foucault relationship:\n     - Derrida's \"Cogito and the History of Madness\" (1963): his critique of Foucault's reading of Descartes in *History of Madness*\n     - The philosophical stakes: whether reason can speak about madness, the status of the Cartesian exclusion\n     - Foucault's response in the revised edition and the appendix \"My Body, This Paper, This Fire\"\n     - The broader significance of this exchange for understanding both thinkers' projects\n     - Citations to both primary texts and secondary scholarship (e.g., work by Leonard Lawlor)\n\n**Minor Points**: We will develop the Tel Quel association beyond mere mention, explaining Derrida's relationship with Philippe Sollers and the journal's role in disseminating his early work, with appropriate citations.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Citation Overhaul (Critical Priority)**:\n- Add 8-10 primary Derrida texts with specific page references\n- Add 8-10 major secondary sources (Gasch\u00e9, Bennington, Spivak, Caputo, Critchley, Peeters, Cusset)\n- Add interdisciplinary sources demonstrating concrete influence (Spivak, Butler, critical legal studies)\n- Total citations: 20-25 scholarly sources (exceeding our original commitment)\n\n**Content Expansions**:\n- New dedicated subsection: \"Deconstruction and Literary Criticism\" (350-400 words)\n- Expanded *Speech and Phenomena* analysis with technical precision on the \"living present\" (150-200 words)\n- Expanded supplementarity discussion with textual analysis and quotation (150-200 words)\n- Expanded Searle debate with philosophical stakes (200-250 words)\n- New paragraph on Derrida-Foucault relationship (150-200 words)\n- Developed Tel Quel discussion\n\n**Structural Improvements**:\n- All substantive claims linked to specific citations\n- Biographical facts sourced to Peeters\n- Controversy details properly documented\n- Interdisciplinary influence demonstrated rather than asserted\n\nWe are committed to delivering these revisions in full and recognize that our credibility with the reviewers depends on actually implementing what we promise. We thank the reviewers for their patience and continued engagement with this manuscript.",
