## Author Response - Round 2

### Overview

We thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript and for their careful assessment of our revisions. We are gratified that the reviewers recognize the substantial content improvements made in Round 1, including the expanded treatment of différance, the new sections on trace and supplementarity, the coverage of Derrida's later ethical and political work (hospitality, democracy to come, hauntology), and the improved discussion of controversies including the Cambridge affair and de Man affair.

However, we must acknowledge a serious failure on our part: despite our explicit commitment in the Round 1 response to overhaul the citation apparatus with 18-20 scholarly sources including primary Derrida texts and major secondary literature, we did not implement these changes. All three reviewers have rightly identified this as a critical deficiency that undermines the credibility of our manuscript. We offer no excuses for this oversight and commit to rectifying it fully in this revision. We also acknowledge the remaining gaps in our treatment of literary criticism, the Searle debate, and the Foucault relationship. Below, we provide detailed responses to each reviewer and a comprehensive plan for revision.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Applications)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 1's acknowledgment of the genuine content improvements while recognizing that their overall score of 5.7/10 reflects the critical failure to implement our promised citation overhaul. The citation score of 3/10 is entirely justified given the discrepancy between our stated commitments and actual revisions.

**Major Points**:

1. **Citation apparatus remains fundamentally inadequate despite explicit promises**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. Our failure to implement the promised citations represents a serious breach of trust with the reviewers. There is no justification for this oversight, and we take full responsibility.
   - **Action taken**: We will now implement the citation overhaul in full. The revised manuscript will include:
     - Primary Derrida texts: *Of Grammatology* (1967), *Speech and Phenomena* (1967), *Writing and Difference* (1967), *Margins of Philosophy* (1972), *Limited Inc* (1988), *Specters of Marx* (1993), *Of Hospitality* (1997), and *Rogues* (2003), with specific page references for all substantive claims
     - Secondary scholarship: Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's translator's preface to *Of Grammatology*; Rodolphe Gasché's *The Tain of the Mirror* (1986); Geoffrey Bennington's contributions to *Jacques Derrida* (1991); John Caputo's *Deconstruction in a Nutshell* (1997); Simon Critchley's *The Ethics of Deconstruction* (1992); Benoît Peeters' *Derrida: A Biography* (2010)
     - Interdisciplinary applications: Spivak's "Can the Subaltern Speak?" (1988); Butler's *Gender Trouble* (1990); critical legal studies sources demonstrating concrete influence
     - The Maleuvre and Long citations will be retained where appropriate but supplemented with this more robust scholarly apparatus

2. **Promised subsection on "Deconstruction and Literary Criticism" not delivered**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that our promised 300-400 word dedicated subsection appears only as a single sentence. This was another failure to implement stated revisions.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated subsection (350-400 words) titled "Deconstruction and Literary Criticism" that traces:
     - The institutional reception through the Yale School (Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman, Harold Bloom)
     - Barbara Johnson's work on close reading and deconstruction
     - The transformation of literary studies methodology in the 1970s-80s
     - Specific examples of deconstructive reading practices with citations to primary critical texts

3. **Interdisciplinary influence asserted but not demonstrated with citations**
   - **Our response**: We agree that claims about Spivak and Butler's engagement with Derrida require direct citation to their work, not mere assertion.
   - **Action taken**: We will add concrete examples with proper citations:
     - Spivak's "Can the Subaltern Speak?" with analysis of how she deploys deconstructive strategies
     - Butler's *Gender Trouble* with specific discussion of how she draws on Derrida's critique of origins
     - Critical legal studies: Roberto Unger and Duncan Kennedy's use of deconstructive methods, with appropriate citations

**Minor Points**: We will remove the Schneider reference entirely (as noted, it was removed but not adequately replaced) and ensure all citations directly support claims about Derrida's influence.

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Continental Philosophy and Phenomenology)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 2 for recognizing the substantial improvements in our exposition of différance, trace, and supplementarity, and for the fair assessment reflected in the 6.0/10 score. We accept that the citation failure (3/10) prevents a higher overall evaluation.

**Major Points**:

1. **Citation apparatus "catastrophically inadequate" with no primary Derrida texts cited**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this characterization. A manuscript making claims about Derrida's arguments in *Speech and Phenomena* or *Of Grammatology* without citing those texts lacks basic scholarly credibility.
   - **Action taken**: As detailed above, we will cite all major primary texts with page references. For the philosophical exposition specifically:
     - *Speech and Phenomena*: citations for the critique of Husserl's "living present," the analysis of *Bedeutung*, and the "solitary mental life" discussion
     - *Of Grammatology*: citations for the Rousseau reading, the "dangerous supplement" analysis, and the critique of phonocentrism
     - *Margins of Philosophy*: citation for "Différance" essay with specific page references for the Saussure, Husserl, and Heidegger triangulation
     - Gasché's *The Tain of the Mirror* will be cited for the analysis of "infrastructures" and the relationship between deconstruction and transcendental philosophy

2. **Speech and Phenomena treatment lacks technical precision on the "living present"**
   - **Our response**: We agree that mentioning retention/protention without adequately developing the analysis weakens the philosophical exposition.
   - **Action taken**: We will expand this section (approximately 150-200 additional words) to explain:
     - How Husserl's analysis of time-consciousness requires retention (just-past) and protention (just-about-to-be) as constitutive of the present moment
     - How this necessary structure means the present is always already divided, never simply self-identical
     - How this undermines the phenomenological project of grounding knowledge in the self-presence of consciousness
     - Direct quotation from Derrida's text demonstrating the argument

3. **Supplementarity discussion summarizes conclusions without showing the argument**
   - **Our response**: This is a valid criticism. Philosophical exposition should demonstrate argumentative logic, not merely report conclusions.
   - **Action taken**: We will add textual analysis (150-200 words) that:
     - Quotes specific passages from Derrida's reading of Rousseau on writing as "dangerous supplement"
     - Shows how the supplement is both addition (external, inessential) and substitution (taking the place of what it supplements)
     - Demonstrates how this logic reveals that what appears primary (speech, nature, presence) is always already supplemented
     - Includes page references to *Of Grammatology* Part II

**Minor Points**: We will ensure that the engagement with Bennington and Spivak's translator's preface is substantive rather than merely nominal, with specific discussion of their interpretive contributions.

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Intellectual History and French Theory)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 3's recognition of the substantial improvements in intellectual-historical contextualization and controversy coverage. The 6.0/10 score fairly reflects genuine content improvement alongside the critical citation failure.

**Major Points**:

1. **Citation apparatus remains critically underdeveloped despite promises**
   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. Claims about biographical facts, institutional history, and intellectual debates require proper sourcing.
   - **Action taken**: In addition to the primary and secondary sources listed above, we will add:
     - Peeters' *Derrida: A Biography* for all biographical claims (1940 expulsion, ENS admission, 1967 publications)
     - François Cusset's *French Theory* (2008) for the American reception
     - Proper documentation for the Cambridge affair including contemporary accounts
     - Citations for claims about the de Man affair and Derrida's response "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell"

2. **Searle debate mentioned but not substantively analyzed**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that introducing iterability without explaining the philosophical stakes leaves the discussion incomplete.
   - **Action taken**: We will expand the Searle debate section (200-250 additional words) to explain:
     - Austin's speech act theory and the distinction between serious and parasitic utterances
     - Derrida's critique in "Signature Event Context": iterability as the condition of possibility for any sign
     - Searle's response defending the determinacy of illocutionary force
     - Derrida's reply in "Limited Inc a b c..." and the philosophical stakes regarding context, intention, and meaning
     - Citations to *Limited Inc* and relevant secondary literature

3. **Foucault relationship gestured toward but not developed**
   - **Our response**: We agree that a single sentence on the 1963 lecture is inadequate treatment of a significant intellectual exchange.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated paragraph (150-200 words) on the Derrida-Foucault relationship:
     - Derrida's "Cogito and the History of Madness" (1963): his critique of Foucault's reading of Descartes in *History of Madness*
     - The philosophical stakes: whether reason can speak about madness, the status of the Cartesian exclusion
     - Foucault's response in the revised edition and the appendix "My Body, This Paper, This Fire"
     - The broader significance of this exchange for understanding both thinkers' projects
     - Citations to both primary texts and secondary scholarship (e.g., work by Leonard Lawlor)

**Minor Points**: We will develop the Tel Quel association beyond mere mention, explaining Derrida's relationship with Philippe Sollers and the journal's role in disseminating his early work, with appropriate citations.
