## Author Response - Round 1

### Overview

We thank all three reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their detailed, constructive feedback. The reviews converge on several critical points that we recognize as significant limitations requiring substantial revision: (1) inadequate coverage of Derrida's later ethical and political writings, (2) a severely underdeveloped citation apparatus that fails to engage with primary texts or major secondary scholarship, (3) insufficient intellectual-historical contextualization within French theory and the structuralist/post-structuralist moment, and (4) superficial treatment of core philosophical concepts including différance, trace, and supplementarity.

We accept these criticisms as valid and are committed to a comprehensive revision that addresses each concern. Our revision strategy will involve three major undertakings: first, substantially expanding the manuscript to include dedicated sections on Derrida's post-1990 work and the "ethical turn"; second, completely overhauling the citation apparatus to include direct engagement with Derrida's primary texts and at least 15-20 scholarly sources representing current Derrida scholarship; and third, deepening the philosophical exposition of core concepts while situating them properly within their intellectual-historical context. We appreciate the reviewers' recognition of the manuscript's strengths—particularly its accessible prose, biographical integration, and treatment of the Algerian context—and will preserve these qualities while addressing the identified deficiencies.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Applications)

**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.2/10 and recognize that this reviewer has identified fundamental gaps in our manuscript's coverage of Derrida's interdisciplinary impact and later work. The characterization of our manuscript as presenting a "troubling paradox"—gesturing toward broad influence without documenting it—is apt and will guide our revisions.

**Major Points**:

1. **Severely inadequate coverage of later ethical and political writings**
   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely justified. Our manuscript's near-exclusive focus on Derrida's early deconstructive work (pre-1980) presents an incomplete and distorted picture of his philosophical development. The "ethical turn" represented by works from the 1990s onward constitutes a major phase of Derrida's thought that we inexcusably neglected.
   - **Action taken**: We will add two new substantial sections: (a) "The Ethical Turn: Hospitality, the Gift, and Responsibility" covering *The Gift of Death* (1995), *Of Hospitality* (1997), and the concept of unconditional hospitality versus conditional hospitality; and (b) "Politics and Spectrality: Democracy to Come" covering *Specters of Marx* (1993), the concept of hauntology, autoimmunity in *Rogues* (2003), and the messianic structure of "democracy to come" (démocratie à venir). Each section will receive approximately 500-700 words of dedicated analysis.

2. **Insufficient citation base (only three citations)**
   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. Three citations—one of which is tangentially relevant—cannot support a comprehensive research report on a major philosopher. This represents a serious methodological failure.
   - **Action taken**: Our revised manuscript will include direct citations to Derrida's primary texts (*Of Grammatology*, *Writing and Difference*, *Speech and Phenomena*, *Margins of Philosophy*, *Specters of Marx*, *The Gift of Death*, *Of Hospitality*, *Rogues*) and engagement with major secondary literature including Geoffrey Bennington's *Jacques Derrida* (1993), John Caputo's *The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida* (1997), Simon Critchley's *The Ethics of Deconstruction* (1992), Gayatri Spivak's preface to *Of Grammatology*, and Judith Butler's engagements with Derrida. We commit to a minimum of 18-20 scholarly sources.

3. **The Schneider reference is tangential and puzzling**
   - **Our response**: We appreciate this observation. The Schneider reference was included to gesture toward Derrida's relevance for questions of alterity and non-human communication, but we acknowledge it is poorly integrated and does not effectively demonstrate Derrida's interdisciplinary impact.
   - **Action taken**: We will either remove this reference entirely or substantially reconceptualize its inclusion within a new section on Derrida's influence across disciplines. We are inclined toward the former option, replacing it with scholarship that concretely demonstrates Derrida's impact on literary theory (the Yale School), postcolonial studies (Spivak), feminist theory (Butler), and legal studies (critical legal studies movement).

4. **Absence of discussion of deconstruction's transformation of literary studies**
   - **Our response**: This is a significant oversight given our manuscript's framing. The influence of deconstruction on American literary criticism through Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, Barbara Johnson, and the broader Yale School represents one of Derrida's most consequential interdisciplinary impacts.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated subsection on "Deconstruction and Literary Criticism" that traces the institutional reception of Derrida's work in American English departments, the Yale School's development of deconstructive reading practices, and the subsequent debates about the politics of deconstruction in literary studies.

**Minor Points**: We will ensure that our expanded discussion of hospitality adequately addresses its relevance for contemporary debates about migration, sovereignty, and ethics, as the reviewer suggests. We will also add concrete examples of deconstructive analysis in postcolonial theory and gender studies rather than merely asserting Derrida's influence.

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Intellectual History and French Theory)

**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.2/10 and recognize that this reviewer has identified a fundamental problem with our manuscript: it presents a "decontextualized portrait" of Derrida that fails to situate his work within the French intellectual milieu that gave it meaning and urgency.

**Major Points**:

1. **Almost complete absence of engagement with French intellectual context**
   - **Our response**: This criticism strikes at a core deficiency in our manuscript. Understanding why Derrida's interventions mattered when they did requires understanding structuralism's dominance in 1960s French thought, the influence of Saussure and Lévi-Strauss, and the complex relationships among major figures of the period.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section titled "Intellectual Context: Structuralism and Its Discontents" that addresses: (a) the structuralist moment and the influence of Saussure, Lévi-Strauss, and Jakobson; (b) Derrida's complex positioning vis-à-vis structuralism—neither simply within nor against it; (c) his association with and distance from the Tel Quel group; (d) his relationship to other major figures including Foucault, Lacan, and Althusser; and (e) the famous debate with Foucault over Descartes and madness ("Cogito and the History of Madness").

2. **Key controversies absent or superficially treated**
   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our treatment of the Cambridge affair lacks specificity and that our complete omission of the de Man affair and the Searle debate represents a serious gap in any account of Derrida's reception and intellectual legacy.
   - **Action taken**: We will substantially revise and expand our "Controversies and Reception" section to include: (a) detailed treatment of the Cambridge affair with specific information (the 336-204 vote, the opposition letter organized by Barry Smith and signed by figures including Ruth Barcan Marcus, W.V. Quine, and others, and the specific objections raised); (b) a new subsection on the de Man affair—the 1987 revelation of de Man's wartime writings for collaborationist publications and Derrida's controversial response in "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell," including discussion of the ethical questions this raised about deconstruction's relationship to politics and history; (c) the extended debate with John Searle over speech act theory, culminating in *Limited Inc* (1988), which remains essential for understanding Derrida's theory of iterability.

3. **Inadequate citation apparatus with no primary sources**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The absence of direct citations to Derrida's own texts is a fundamental scholarly failure that undermines our manuscript's credibility.
   - **Action taken**: As noted above, we will completely overhaul our citation apparatus. For intellectual-historical claims specifically, we will cite Benoît Peeters' authoritative biography *Derrida* (2010), Edward Baring's *The Young Derrida and French Philosophy* (2011), and François Cusset's *French Theory* (2008) for the American reception. Claims about specific events (Vichy laws, ENS admission, the 1967 publications, the Cambridge vote) will be properly sourced.

**Minor Points**: We will ensure that our revised discussion of Derrida's relationship to phenomenology in France adequately addresses the institutional and intellectual context of his early career, including his position at the ENS and his relationships with figures like Jean Hyppolite and Maurice de Gandillac.

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Continental Philosophy and Phenomenology)

**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.0/10 and recognize that this reviewer has identified critical deficiencies in our treatment of Derrida's core philosophical concepts. The observation that our exposition "lacks the technical precision required for serious scholarly work" is a fair assessment that we are committed to addressing.

**Major Points**:

1. **Superficial treatment of différance**
   - **Our response**: We accept that our exposition of différance is inadequate. We mentioned the "to differ" and "to defer" dimensions but failed to provide the systematic analysis this concept requires, including its relationship to Saussure's differential theory of value, Husserl's phenomenology of time-consciousness, and Heidegger's ontological difference.
   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand our treatment of différance to include: (a) detailed exposition of its Saussurean background—how Saussure's insight that "in language there are only differences without positive terms" provides the synchronic dimension of différance; (b) the temporal dimension of deferral derived from Derrida's reading of Husserl's analysis of internal time-consciousness in *Speech and Phenomena*, showing how presence is always already constituted through retention and protention; (c) the relationship to Heidegger's ontological difference and the question of Being, while noting Derrida's critical distance from Heideggerian nostalgia; (d) explanation of how différance names the condition of possibility for signification itself while remaining irreducible to any concept.

2. **Trace and supplementarity barely mentioned despite being identified as key concepts**
   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely valid. We identified these as key concepts but failed to deliver substantive analysis, which represents a significant failure to meet our own stated objectives.
   - **Action taken**: We will add dedicated subsections on: (a) "The Trace and Archi-Writing"—explaining how the trace names the structure of "always already" that precedes and makes possible any present moment or self-identical meaning, and how archi-writing (archi-écriture) is not empirical writing but the condition of possibility for both speech and writing; (b) "The Logic of the Supplement"—providing detailed analysis of supplementarity as developed in *Of Grammatology*'s reading of Rousseau, explaining how the supplement is simultaneously addition and substitution, how it reveals that what it supplements was never complete or self-sufficient, and how this logic undermines the nature/culture, inside/outside oppositions.

3. **Engagement with Husserl, Heidegger, and Saussure remains superficial**
   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our manuscript gestures toward these engagements without adequately analyzing them. Given that Derrida's early work is fundamentally constituted through critical readings of these figures, this represents a serious deficiency.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a section titled "Critical Engagements: Husserl, Heidegger, Saussure" that provides: (a) analysis of *Speech and Phenomena* as Derrida's most sustained engagement with Husserl, focusing on the critique of the "living present" and the voice as self-presence; (b) examination of Derrida's relationship to Heidegger—both his debt to Heideggerian destruction of metaphysics and his critical distance from what he saw as Heidegger's residual nostalgia for authentic origin; (c) detailed exposition of the critique of Saussure in *Of Grammatology*, specifically how Saussure's phonocentrism (privileging speech over writing) contradicts his own differential theory of the sign.

4. **Citation apparatus is "woefully inadequate"**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this characterization. A manuscript on Derrida that does not cite Derrida is, as the reviewer states, "fundamentally compromised."
   - **Action taken**: Our revised manuscript will cite Derrida's primary texts directly and extensively. For the philosophical exposition specifically, we will engage with Rodolphe Gasché's *The Tain of the Mirror* (1986) for its rigorous analysis of Derrida's "infrastructures," Geoffrey Bennington's systematic exposition in *Jacques Derrida* (1993), and Gayatri Spivak's translator's preface to *Of Grammatology* (1976). We will remove or substantially minimize the tangential Schneider reference.

**Minor Points**: We appreciate the reviewer's acknowledgment of our manuscript's accessible prose and will maintain this quality while adding the necessary technical precision. We will also ensure that our revised discussion of the 1967 publications provides adequate analysis of each text's specific contribution rather than treating them as an undifferentiated whole.
