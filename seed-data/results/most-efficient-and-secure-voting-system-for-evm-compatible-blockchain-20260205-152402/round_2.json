      "summary": "This manuscript provides a comprehensive survey of EVM voting systems with substantially improved gas analysis methodology compared to typical treatments. The empirical measurements using Foundry and mainnet transaction data add credibility, though several gas figures require verification and the upgrade pattern analysis, while present, lacks depth on storage layout migration challenges.",

        "Excellent granular breakdown of EVM opcode costs (SSTORE cold/warm, SLOAD, precompile costs) that correctly reflects post-EIP-2929 pricing, demonstrating genuine understanding of gas mechanics",
        "Honest acknowledgment of MACI gas cost variance (450K-550K) rather than presenting idealized figures, with proper attribution to tree depth and batch size dependencies",
        "Strong treatment of MEV attack vectors specific to voting phases, including commit-phase timing correlation and reveal-phase censorship - this is often overlooked in voting system literature"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "The gas comparison table is incomplete (manuscript cuts off mid-sentence) and the 'Total (1000 voters)' column conflates per-vote costs with fixed verification costs in misleading ways - MACI's 700K verification is amortized across all voters, not additive",
        "Upgrade pattern analysis (Section 2.6) mentions UUPS and Diamond patterns but doesn't address the critical issue of storage slot collision when upgrading voting contracts with active state - what happens to in-progress votes during upgrade?",
        "Missing analysis of calldata vs storage tradeoffs for vote data, particularly relevant given EIP-4844 blob transactions which could dramatically reduce costs for batch vote submission"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add explicit gas profiling for Merkle proof verification at different tree depths (common in voter eligibility checks) - the cost scales as O(depth * hash_cost) and this significantly impacts voter registration gas",
        "Include analysis of ERC-2771 meta-transactions and gas abstraction patterns for voting - many DAOs subsidize voter gas costs, and the relayer architecture has security implications for vote integrity",
        "Provide concrete storage layout diagrams for upgradeable voting contracts showing how vote commitments, revealed votes, and tally state must be preserved across implementation upgrades"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a gas optimization perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge but misses several optimization opportunities that practitioners would find valuable. The SSTORE analysis correctly identifies cold/warm access patterns, but doesn't explore the implications of EIP-1153 transient storage for commit-reveal schemes where commitments could be stored transiently during a single block's voting window, potentially reducing costs by 90%+. The MACI gas analysis is commendably honest about real-world costs, but the manuscript should clarify that the Poseidon hash used in MACI is not a native EVM precompile - it's implemented in Solidity with ~15,000 gas per hash, which explains much of the cost overhead compared to native keccak256. For the upgrade patterns section, the critical missing piece is how to handle the state migration problem: if a voting contract has 10,000 voter commitments in a mapping, upgrading the implementation doesn't migrate that data, but changing the storage layout in the new implementation will cause slot collisions. The manuscript should recommend immutable storage layouts or explicit migration functions with gas cost estimates. The optimistic voting gas estimate of 100K-150K for verification seems low if fraud proofs require re-executing vote tallies on-chain - this needs clarification on what computation the fraud proof actually verifies. Finally, the comparison table's methodology column is good practice, but the table itself appears truncated and the cost model clarification sentence is cut off, suggesting incomplete revision.",

        "The claim that 'commit-reveal schemes combined with ZKPs' offer 'the most balanced approach' is insufficiently justified - commit-reveal fundamentally fails to provide ballot secrecy during the reveal phase, and the manuscript doesn't adequately explain how ZKPs remediate this (they don't in the described architecture)",

      "suggestions": [
        "Provide formal game-based definitions for ballot secrecy and coercion-resistance in the blockchain setting, then rigorously analyze which systems achieve which properties under explicit computational assumptions",
        "Expand the ZK-proof analysis to include: (1) concrete circuit sizes for voting operations, (2) prover memory requirements which often dominate practical deployments, (3) proof aggregation schemes like SnarkPack that dramatically change the amortized verification cost analysis",
        "Address the cast-as-intended verification gap more thoroughly - this is arguably the weakest link in all described systems and deserves dedicated treatment including approaches like Benaloh challenges, return codes, or verifiable client-side computation"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic voting protocols perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge but falls short of the rigor needed for its ambitious claims. The treatment of ballot secrecy is particularly concerning: the paper correctly notes that commit-reveal exposes votes during reveal, but then recommends commit-reveal combined with ZKPs without clearly explaining the construction. A proper privacy-preserving voting scheme would use homomorphic tallying (as briefly mentioned with Paillier/ElGamal) or mixnets, not commit-reveal. The MACI analysis is the strongest section, correctly identifying that computational privacy depends on coordinator honesty - but this should lead to a stronger recommendation for threshold decryption variants like MACI with distributed coordinators.\n\nThe verifiability analysis conflates three distinct properties (cast-as-intended, recorded-as-cast, counted-as-recorded) without adequately addressing how each is achieved. For instance, the paper notes cast-as-intended 'depends on client software' but doesn't discuss cryptographic approaches like Benaloh challenges or code voting that can provide stronger guarantees. The end-to-end verifiability claims for various systems need more careful treatment.\n\nThe ZK-proof discussion would benefit from concrete circuit analysis. Stating that Groth16 verification costs '~200,000 gas' is meaningless without specifying the circuit - a simple membership proof differs enormously from a full vote validity proof with eligibility checks. The paper should analyze specific voting circuits: proving vote is in valid range, proving voter eligibility via Merkle membership, proving no double-voting, etc. Additionally, the prover-side costs are dismissed too quickly - for voter-generated proofs, prover efficiency directly impacts usability and may require trusted hardware or delegation, each with security implications.\n\nThe manuscript would be significantly strengthened by: (1) a formal security model with explicit adversary capabilities and winning conditions, (2) concrete protocol specifications rather than high-level descriptions, (3) security proofs or at minimum security arguments with explicit assumptions, and (4) a clearer separation between what is theoretically achievable versus practically deployed. The current presentation mixes aspirational properties with actual system capabilities in ways that could mislead practitioners.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain security and adversarial threat modeling perspective, this revision shows meaningful progress. The addition of Section 3 with explicit adversary models and MEV attack vectors addresses a critical gap from typical voting system analyses. The distinction between passive, active, and coercive adversaries with PPT bounds is appropriate, and the collusion models provide a useful framework.\n\nHowever, several security-critical issues require attention. First, the MEV analysis, while comprehensive in taxonomy, lacks economic modeling. The statement that '30% of Ethereum blocks contain MEV' is cited from Flashbots data but not connected to voting-specific attack incentives. A governance vote controlling $100M creates MEV opportunity, but what's the expected profit margin after accounting for failed attempts, gas costs, and detection risk? Without this, protocol designers cannot properly set bond sizes or challenge periods.\n\nSecond, the Sybil resistance analysis presents a layered scoring approach but doesn't analyze it adversarially. An attacker will optimize across the cheapest identity verification methods. If government ID provides 10 points and the threshold is 15, an attacker needs only 5 additional points from potentially gameable on-chain history or staking. The formal bounds mentioned (fp/fn tradeoffs) are not connected to the proposed implementation.\n\nThird, the MACI security analysis correctly identifies coordinator trust as a limitation but underestimates the severity of coordinator-coercer collusion. In this scenario, the coordinator can: (1) decrypt all votes, (2) monitor for key-change transactions in real-time, (3) inform the coercer before the voting deadline. The key-change mechanism provides no protection here. The manuscript should explicitly state this limitation and analyze threshold coordinator schemes quantitatively - how does security degrade as t approaches n in a t-of-n threshold scheme?\n\nThe liveness analysis for L2s is valuable but should include recent developments like based sequencing and shared sequencer networks that may improve censorship resistance. Additionally, the forced inclusion mechanism analysis should consider adversarial scenarios where the L1 itself experiences congestion during critical voting periods.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from a unified security comparison table mapping each system to explicit adversary capabilities it resists, similar to the gas comparison tables provided. This would make the security tradeoffs immediately actionable for practitioners.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of EVM-compatible voting systems that demonstrates genuine technical competence, particularly in gas analysis methodology, MEV attack taxonomy, and honest acknowledgment of fundamental impossibility results in cryptographic voting. All three reviewers recognize the improved quality from the previous round and commend the empirical grounding using Foundry and mainnet transaction data. The treatment of practical concerns\u2014including post-EIP-2929 gas pricing, L2 liveness delays, and MACI's coercion-resistance limitations\u2014reflects meaningful engagement with real-world deployment challenges.\n\nHowever, the reviewers converge on several substantive gaps that prevent acceptance in the current form. Most critically, the manuscript lacks formal rigor in its security claims: game-based definitions for ballot secrecy and coercion-resistance are absent, the claim that commit-reveal with ZKPs offers a 'balanced approach' is insufficiently justified (since commit-reveal fundamentally fails ballot secrecy during reveal), and the Sybil resistance scoring system appears arbitrary without adversarial cost analysis. The gas comparison table is incomplete and potentially misleading in how it presents amortized versus per-voter costs. Additionally, the MACI coordinator-coercer collusion scenario\u2014which completely breaks coercion resistance\u2014requires deeper analysis with concrete mitigations.\n\nWhile the manuscript has clear merit as a practitioner-oriented survey, the combination of incomplete technical content (truncated tables, missing storage layout analysis for upgrades) and insufficient formal treatment of security properties represents a gap between the paper's claims and its demonstrated rigor. These issues are addressable but require substantial work beyond minor editorial fixes.",

    "recommendation": "The manuscript demonstrates solid technical foundations and addresses an important topic, but currently falls between a practitioner guide and a rigorous academic survey without fully succeeding as either.

Either path requires completing the truncated content, correcting the gas cost presentation, and substantially expanding the MACI collusion analysis. The core material is valuable\u2014the revision should focus on consistency between claims and demonstrated rigor.",
