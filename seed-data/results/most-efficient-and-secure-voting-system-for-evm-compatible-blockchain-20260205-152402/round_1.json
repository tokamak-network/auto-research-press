The gas figures presented appear to be rough estimates rather than measured values, and critical analysis of smart contract upgrade patterns and on-chain vs off-chain tradeoffs remains superficial.",

        "Gas cost figures lack empirical validation - the claim of '50,000-200,000 gas per vote' for traditional systems and '60-80% reduction' with ZK implementations are not substantiated with actual measurements or methodology",
        "MACI gas analysis appears significantly underestimated - registration at ~100,000 gas ignores the expensive state tree operations, and the 400,000 gas per vote figure doesn't account for message processing complexity",
        "Smart contract upgrade patterns and their security implications for voting integrity are completely absent despite being listed as a focus area"

        "Expand the on-chain vs off-chain analysis with concrete cost models including data availability costs, proof generation costs, and verification costs across different L2 solutions"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From an EVM gas optimization perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening. The gas figures in Table 4.1 appear to be rough approximations rather than measured values. For instance, the 'Simple On-chain' figure of 50,000 gas per vote is plausible for the basic implementation shown, but fails to account for cold vs warm storage access (SSTORE costs 20,000 gas for zero-to-nonzero vs 2,900 for nonzero-to-nonzero post-EIP-2929). The MACI analysis is particularly problematic - the claim of 400,000 gas per vote significantly underestimates the actual costs. MACI's message tree insertions involve multiple Poseidon hash computations (each ~25,000 gas for a 2-input hash via precompile, or ~100,000+ via Solidity), and the state tree updates are O(log n) operations. Real MACI deployments on mainnet have shown costs exceeding 800,000 gas per vote in many cases. The manuscript also neglects critical gas optimization patterns: calldata packing for vote batching, using events vs storage for vote recording (21,000 gas base + 8 gas/byte for logs vs 20,000+ for SSTORE), and the impact of EIP-4844 blob transactions on L2 voting costs. The comparison between Vocdoni showing '0 gas per vote' and on-chain solutions is misleading without accounting for the full cost model including data availability and cross-chain verification. Furthermore, the smart contract upgrade analysis is entirely missing - this is critical because voting systems often require upgrades, and patterns like UUPS proxies introduce specific vulnerabilities (e.g., the Wormhole-style uninitialized implementation attack) that could compromise voting integrity. The manuscript should analyze how different upgrade patterns affect vote finality guarantees and whether historical votes remain verifiable post-upgrade.",

      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated section on MEV threat modeling covering: (1) commit-phase frontrunning where attackers observe pending commits to infer voting patterns, (2) reveal-phase ordering attacks, (3) private mempool solutions like Flashbots Protect for vote submission, and (4) encrypted mempool approaches",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain security and adversarial threat modeling perspective, this manuscript has significant gaps that undermine its claim to identify the 'most efficient and secure' voting system. The MEV analysis is essentially absent\u2014this is a critical oversight given that vote submission and revelation phases are prime targets for sophisticated MEV extraction. For commit-reveal schemes, an adversary observing the mempool can potentially correlate commits with voters based on timing, gas prices, or transaction patterns, even before revelation. During the reveal phase, transaction ordering can be manipulated to selectively censor or delay certain vote revelations. The manuscript should analyze private transaction submission mechanisms (Flashbots, MEV Blocker), threshold encryption of transactions, and time-locked encryption approaches.\n\nThe Sybil resistance treatment is particularly weak. Simply stating that Gitcoin uses 'Passport' without analyzing the trust assumptions, false positive/negative rates, privacy implications, and attack costs is insufficient. The manuscript should formalize the Sybil resistance requirements, analyze existing solutions (BrightID, Proof of Humanity, Worldcoin, government ID verification), and discuss the fundamental impossibility results around achieving both strong privacy and strong Sybil resistance simultaneously.\n\nThe liveness analysis is also inadequate. For MACI, what happens if the coordinator goes offline? The manuscript mentions this as a 'trust assumption' but doesn't analyze mitigation strategies like threshold decryption, backup coordinators, or time-locked fallback mechanisms. For L2-based voting, the censorship resistance guarantees are fundamentally weaker than L1\u2014sequencers can trivially censor transactions, and forced inclusion mechanisms have significant delays. The manuscript should quantify these delays and analyze their implications for time-sensitive votes.\n\nThe security property matrix in Section 4.2 assigns ratings without sufficient justification. For example, MACI receives a checkmark for 'Privacy' but the coordinator sees all individual votes\u2014this should be clearly qualified. The 'Liveness' ratings need formal definitions and quantitative bounds. Overall, the manuscript needs substantially more rigorous adversarial analysis to support its conclusions.",

        "ZK proof system selection lacks rigor: the manuscript conflates zk-SNARKs as a monolithic category without distinguishing Groth16, PLONK, or STARKs, each with different trust assumptions (trusted setup vs. transparent), proof sizes, and verification costs critical for on-chain deployment",
        "The verifiability analysis conflates individual verifiability (voter can check their vote was recorded) with universal verifiability (anyone can verify the tally) and end-to-end verifiability (combining both with cast-as-intended verification), which are distinct security properties with different implementation requirements"

        "Add formal security proofs or at minimum cite the cryptographic assumptions underlying each scheme: the Pedersen commitment security relies on discrete log hardness, MACI's coercion-resistance depends on the key-change mechanism and coordinator honesty, and the nullifier scheme requires collision-resistant hashing"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic voting protocols perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening in several areas. First, the treatment of ballot secrecy is imprecise. The manuscript claims MACI provides 'privacy' but doesn't distinguish between computational privacy (votes hidden under encryption) and information-theoretic privacy. More critically, it doesn't address that MACI's coordinator sees all decrypted votes, creating a single point of failure for privacy\u2014this is a significant trust assumption that should be prominently discussed alongside threshold decryption alternatives.\n\nThe verifiability discussion needs restructuring around the established taxonomy: cast-as-intended (voter's device correctly encodes their intent), recorded-as-cast (the system correctly records the encrypted vote), and counted-as-recorded (the tally correctly reflects recorded votes). The circom circuit provided only addresses eligibility and vote validity, not the crucial tally correctness proof which is where the cryptographic complexity lies for universal verifiability.\n\nRegarding ZK proof selection, the manuscript should address that Groth16 (used in many MACI deployments) requires a per-circuit trusted setup, which is problematic for upgradeable voting systems. PLONK with a universal trusted setup or STARKs with transparent setup may be preferable despite higher verification costs. The claim of '60-80% verification cost reduction' from ZK implementations needs citation and clarification\u2014compared to what baseline?\n\nThe homomorphic encryption discussion mentions Paillier and ElGamal but doesn't address the critical distinction: Paillier is additively homomorphic (suitable for tallying) while ElGamal requires re-encryption mixnets for privacy. The circuit example uses ElGamal encryption but doesn't explain how tallying would work without decryption, which is the key advantage of homomorphic schemes.\n\nFinally, the manuscript should engage with the impossibility results in the literature: Benaloh showed that unconditional receipt-freeness is impossible with untrusted voting devices, and this has direct implications for browser-based blockchain voting where the voter's device generates the ZK proof.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of EVM-compatible voting architectures with practical value for practitioners, covering systems from simple on-chain implementations to sophisticated ZK-based protocols like MACI. The reviewers unanimously acknowledge the manuscript's strengths in providing well-structured taxonomies, practical code examples, and coverage of real-world deployments (Gitcoin, MakerDAO, Optimism). The comparative matrices and architectural diagrams effectively communicate implementation patterns and tradeoffs.\n\nHowever, all three reviewers identify significant gaps that undermine the manuscript's claims to comprehensiveness and rigor. The security analysis is notably superficial: Reviewer 2 highlights critical omissions regarding MEV attack vectors, sophisticated Sybil resistance mechanisms, and liveness/censorship guarantees\u2014all essential considerations for production voting systems. Reviewer 3 notes that the cryptographic treatment conflates distinct security properties (individual vs. universal vs. end-to-end verifiability) and fails to distinguish between ZK proof systems with fundamentally different trust assumptions. Reviewer 1's concern about unsubstantiated gas cost claims is particularly damaging, as efficiency comparisons are central to the manuscript's contribution yet lack empirical validation.\n\nThe manuscript has clear potential but requires substantial strengthening in three areas: (1) rigorous empirical validation of gas cost claims using standard profiling tools, (2) formalized threat modeling that addresses MEV, Sybil resistance, and liveness guarantees with appropriate depth, and (3) more precise cryptographic analysis distinguishing proof systems and verifiability properties. These are addressable issues that would significantly elevate the contribution.",
