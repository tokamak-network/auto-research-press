However, the document appears truncated (ending mid-section on threshold coordinators), and while MEV and Sybil resistance are well-covered, the liveness/censorship analysis lacks depth on emerging attack vectors and cross-domain MEV implications.",

        "Excellent formal threat model with explicit adversary types (A_passive through A_coord) and game-based security definitions that properly distinguish between ballot secrecy, receipt-freeness, and coercion-resistance",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The manuscript is clearly truncated mid-section (Section 3.4.3 cuts off at 'Threshold Coordinator Architecture'), leaving critical analysis of coordinator liveness, threshold decryption ceremonies, and recovery mechanisms incomplete",
        "Cross-domain MEV attacks are underexplored - specifically, how an adversary controlling both L1 and L2 sequencing could exploit timing differences between layers to manipulate votes submitted across multiple chains, or how atomic composability with DeFi protocols creates novel attack surfaces",
        "The liveness analysis for L2s focuses on forced inclusion delays but neglects state validity attacks - a malicious sequencer could post invalid state roots that pass the challenge period if challengers are also censored, potentially invalidating entire voting periods before fraud proofs can be submitted"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Complete the threshold coordinator section and add formal analysis of coordinator failure recovery, including: (1) what happens to in-flight votes if t coordinators fail simultaneously, (2) key resharing protocols for coordinator rotation, and (3) verifiable delay functions as fallback decryption mechanisms",
        "Add a dedicated subsection on cross-layer MEV and composability attacks, including scenarios where flash loans on L1 could influence L2 voting snapshots, or where bridge delays create arbitrage opportunities that affect governance token distribution during active votes",
        "Strengthen the censorship resistance analysis with quantitative models: what percentage of sequencer/validator collusion is required to reliably censor a specific voter, and how does this change with multiple submission paths (e.g., submitting same vote to 3 L2s simultaneously)?"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain security and adversarial threat modeling perspective, this manuscript demonstrates strong foundational work but has notable gaps that should be addressed before publication. The formal adversary taxonomy is well-constructed, and I particularly appreciate the explicit computational bounds and the acknowledgment that all privacy guarantees are computational rather than information-theoretic. The MEV analysis is practical and actionable, with the economic break-even calculations providing clear guidance for practitioners.\n\nHowever, several security-critical areas need deeper treatment. First, the interaction between MEV and voting in the presence of proposer-builder separation (PBS) is not adequately addressed. Under PBS, block builders see all private mempool transactions from services like Flashbots Protect, creating a new trust assumption that isn't captured in your threat model. Second, the Sybil resistance section, while comprehensive, doesn't address the temporal dynamics of identity attacks - an adversary could slowly accumulate legitimate-seeming identities over months before a critical vote, making the cost model C(k) time-dependent in ways not captured.\n\nThe L2 liveness analysis correctly identifies forced inclusion delays but misses several critical attack vectors: (1) data availability attacks where the sequencer withholds transaction data, making it impossible to reconstruct state for fraud proofs; (2) griefing attacks on optimistic rollups where an adversary submits invalid fraud proofs to delay finality during voting periods; (3) the interaction between voting deadlines and rollup finality - a vote submitted 1 hour before deadline on an optimistic rollup isn't actually 'final' for 7 days. The manuscript should provide concrete recommendations for how voting periods should be structured relative to rollup finality assumptions.\n\nFinally, the coercion-resistance analysis of MACI is good but should be extended to cover the 'bribery market' attack where a smart contract offers payment for key-change proofs, effectively creating a trustless vote-buying mechanism that circumvents MACI's protections. This is a known attack vector that deserves explicit treatment given MACI's prominence in the manuscript.",

      "summary": "This manuscript provides a solid foundation for understanding EVM-compatible voting systems with commendable attention to formal security definitions and impossibility results. However, the treatment of coercion-resistance mechanisms and ZK-proof system selection contains gaps that require attention, and the analysis of end-to-end verifiability is incomplete.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The coercion-resistance analysis for MACI is incomplete - while the paper correctly notes key-change limitations, it fails to analyze the timing attack where a coercer can monitor the blockchain for any state-changing transaction from the voter's address during the voting period, potentially detecting evasion attempts even without coordinator collusion",
        "The ZK-proof system selection guidance lacks discussion of the trusted setup ceremony implications for voting legitimacy - a compromised Groth16 setup could allow vote fabrication, yet the paper doesn't address multi-party computation ceremonies or the political/social trust requirements",
        "Individual verifiability mechanisms are underspecified - the paper mentions 'cast-as-intended' verification but doesn't address how voters verify correct vote encoding when using client-side ZK proof generation, where malicious JavaScript could encode votes incorrectly"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated section on verifiable vote encoding that addresses the 'malicious client' problem - consider discussing approaches like Benaloh challenges, code auditing requirements, or deterministic builds for voting clients",
        "Expand the MACI coercion-resistance analysis to include a formal game capturing what guarantees actually hold: specifically, model the adversary who can observe all blockchain state and network traffic, and prove what information leakage occurs under different key-change strategies",
        "Include analysis of universal verifiability for homomorphic tallying schemes - specifically, how observers verify that the decryption was performed correctly without learning individual votes (e.g., through Chaum-Pedersen proofs or similar mechanisms)"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic voting protocols perspective, this manuscript demonstrates strong foundational knowledge but has notable gaps in the verification and coercion-resistance analysis. The formal definitions in Section 2.1.1 are well-constructed, though Definition 4 (coercion-resistance) would benefit from the full JCJ formalization including the 'fake credential' mechanism that enables the counter-strategy. The paper correctly identifies that MACI's key-change approach is an approximation of coercion-resistance, but the analysis should go further: even without coordinator collusion, a sophisticated coercer can implement a 'monitoring contract' that tracks all transactions from registered voters and flags any activity during the voting period as suspicious. This fundamentally limits MACI's coercion-resistance to scenarios where voters can plausibly deny that any transaction they made was a key change.\n\nThe ZK-proof efficiency analysis is practical and useful, but the paper should address the verification of proof correctness from the voter's perspective. When a voter generates a ZK proof client-side, how do they know the proof actually encodes their intended vote? This is the 'cast-as-intended' problem, and solutions like Benaloh challenges (where the voter can request the system 'open' a subset of ballots to verify correct encoding) don't translate directly to the ZK setting. The paper should discuss approaches like verifiable computation on the client side or trusted execution environments.\n\nFor the homomorphic encryption schemes discussed, the paper should elaborate on how universal verifiability is achieved. Simply stating that 'decryption reveals only the final tally' is insufficient - observers need cryptographic proof that the decryption was performed correctly. For threshold ElGamal, this typically involves each decryption share coming with a Chaum-Pedersen proof of correct partial decryption. This is a non-trivial gas cost that should be included in the efficiency analysis.\n\nThe proof aggregation discussion via SnarkPack is valuable, but note that aggregated proofs still require the original proofs to be valid - the aggregation doesn't hide invalid proofs. For voting, this means individual vote validity must still be checked somewhere, either on-chain before aggregation or within the aggregation circuit itself, which significantly increases circuit complexity.",

        "The claimed gas costs (48,000-65,000 per vote for traditional systems, 450,000-550,000 for MACI signUp + publishMessage) are stated as 'measured via Foundry gas snapshots' but no methodology section describes the test contracts, compiler settings (optimizer runs), or whether these are mainnet fork tests vs isolated unit tests - this significantly impacts reproducibility",

      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated methodology section with: (1) Solidity compiler version and optimizer settings, (2) specific test contract implementations used for gas measurement, (3) whether measurements used mainnet fork state or clean state (affects cold/warm access patterns significantly), (4) block gas limit assumptions for batch operation feasibility",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From an EVM gas optimization perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge but falls short of the empirical rigor expected for a comprehensive research report. The gas cost table for opcodes is accurate and the distinction between cold/warm storage access is correctly emphasized - this is crucial since a voting contract accessing voter state will see dramatically different costs depending on access patterns within a transaction. However, the per-vote cost claims need more substantiation. For instance, the 48,000-65,000 gas range for 'traditional on-chain voting' likely assumes a single SSTORE for vote recording plus some validation logic, but this varies enormously based on implementation: does the contract use a mapping (cheaper) or array (more expensive for enumeration)? Is there a snapshot lookup (additional SLOAD)? Are there event emissions (375 + 8*bytes gas)? The MACI figures of 450,000-550,000 gas are plausible for signUp + publishMessage but should be broken down by operation. The upgrade pattern section is genuinely useful, particularly the storage gap pattern and the noActiveVotes modifier - these are production-relevant concerns. However, I'd recommend adding analysis of the UUPS vs Transparent proxy gas overhead in the context of high-frequency voting operations: the ~500 gas difference per call becomes significant when processing thousands of votes. The EIP-7201 namespaced storage pattern mentioned deserves expansion as it's becoming the standard approach for avoiding storage collisions. The missing on-chain vs off-chain comparison is a significant gap given it was highlighted as a key focus area. A complete analysis should quantify: (1) full on-chain tallying costs O(n) in votes with ~5,000-10,000 gas per vote aggregation, (2) optimistic approaches with ~200,000 gas for fraud proof verification but O(1) happy-path costs, (3) ZK-verified off-chain computation with ~200,000-350,000 gas for proof verification regardless of vote count. This comparison would directly inform architecture decisions for different scale requirements.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive treatment of blockchain voting security with notable strengths in formal threat modeling, economic analysis of MEV attacks, and practical gas cost considerations for EVM-compatible systems. All three reviewers converge on similar assessments (7.2/10 average), recognizing the work's solid theoretical foundations\u2014particularly the game-based security definitions, impossibility result acknowledgments, and rigorous Sybil resistance analysis. The formal decomposition of end-to-end verifiability and the practical MEV break-even calculations demonstrate both academic rigor and real-world applicability.\n\nHowever, reviewers unanimously identify a critical structural issue: the manuscript is truncated mid-section (Section 3.4.3 on Threshold Coordinator Architecture), leaving essential analysis incomplete. Beyond this obvious gap, substantive technical concerns emerge across reviews: the coercion-resistance analysis for MACI overlooks timing attacks from blockchain observation; cross-domain MEV attacks and L1/L2 composability vulnerabilities receive insufficient attention; and the empirical methodology for gas cost measurements lacks reproducibility details. The trusted setup ceremony implications for ZK-proof systems and the 'malicious client' problem for vote encoding verification represent additional gaps that weaken the otherwise strong cryptographic treatment.\n\nGiven this is the final review round and the core contributions are sound, the identified issues are addressable through targeted revisions rather than fundamental restructuring. The manuscript would benefit the community once completed, but publication in its current truncated state would be inappropriate.",
