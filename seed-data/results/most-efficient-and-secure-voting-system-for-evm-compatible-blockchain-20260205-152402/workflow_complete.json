          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From an EVM gas optimization perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening. The gas figures in Table 4.1 appear to be rough approximations rather than measured values. For instance, the 'Simple On-chain' figure of 50,000 gas per vote is plausible for the basic implementation shown, but fails to account for cold vs warm storage access (SSTORE costs 20,000 gas for zero-to-nonzero vs 2,900 for nonzero-to-nonzero post-EIP-2929). The MACI analysis is particularly problematic - the claim of 400,000 gas per vote significantly underestimates the actual costs. MACI's message tree insertions involve multiple Poseidon hash computations (each ~25,000 gas for a 2-input hash via precompile, or ~100,000+ via Solidity), and the state tree updates are O(log n) operations. Real MACI deployments on mainnet have shown costs exceeding 800,000 gas per vote in many cases. The manuscript also neglects critical gas optimization patterns: calldata packing for vote batching, using events vs storage for vote recording (21,000 gas base + 8 gas/byte for logs vs 20,000+ for SSTORE), and the impact of EIP-4844 blob transactions on L2 voting costs. The comparison between Vocdoni showing '0 gas per vote' and on-chain solutions is misleading without accounting for the full cost model including data availability and cross-chain verification. Furthermore, the smart contract upgrade analysis is entirely missing - this is critical because voting systems often require upgrades, and patterns like UUPS proxies introduce specific vulnerabilities (e.g., the Wormhole-style uninitialized implementation attack) that could compromise voting integrity. The manuscript should analyze how different upgrade patterns affect vote finality guarantees and whether historical votes remain verifiable post-upgrade.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain security and adversarial threat modeling perspective, this manuscript has significant gaps that undermine its claim to identify the 'most efficient and secure' voting system. The MEV analysis is essentially absent\u2014this is a critical oversight given that vote submission and revelation phases are prime targets for sophisticated MEV extraction. For commit-reveal schemes, an adversary observing the mempool can potentially correlate commits with voters based on timing, gas prices, or transaction patterns, even before revelation. During the reveal phase, transaction ordering can be manipulated to selectively censor or delay certain vote revelations. The manuscript should analyze private transaction submission mechanisms (Flashbots, MEV Blocker), threshold encryption of transactions, and time-locked encryption approaches.\n\nThe Sybil resistance treatment is particularly weak. Simply stating that Gitcoin uses 'Passport' without analyzing the trust assumptions, false positive/negative rates, privacy implications, and attack costs is insufficient. The manuscript should formalize the Sybil resistance requirements, analyze existing solutions (BrightID, Proof of Humanity, Worldcoin, government ID verification), and discuss the fundamental impossibility results around achieving both strong privacy and strong Sybil resistance simultaneously.\n\nThe liveness analysis is also inadequate. For MACI, what happens if the coordinator goes offline? The manuscript mentions this as a 'trust assumption' but doesn't analyze mitigation strategies like threshold decryption, backup coordinators, or time-locked fallback mechanisms. For L2-based voting, the censorship resistance guarantees are fundamentally weaker than L1\u2014sequencers can trivially censor transactions, and forced inclusion mechanisms have significant delays. The manuscript should quantify these delays and analyze their implications for time-sensitive votes.\n\nThe security property matrix in Section 4.2 assigns ratings without sufficient justification. For example, MACI receives a checkmark for 'Privacy' but the coordinator sees all individual votes\u2014this should be clearly qualified. The 'Liveness' ratings need formal definitions and quantitative bounds. Overall, the manuscript needs substantially more rigorous adversarial analysis to support its conclusions.",

          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic voting protocols perspective, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening in several areas. First, the treatment of ballot secrecy is imprecise. The manuscript claims MACI provides 'privacy' but doesn't distinguish between computational privacy (votes hidden under encryption) and information-theoretic privacy. More critically, it doesn't address that MACI's coordinator sees all decrypted votes, creating a single point of failure for privacy\u2014this is a significant trust assumption that should be prominently discussed alongside threshold decryption alternatives.\n\nThe verifiability discussion needs restructuring around the established taxonomy: cast-as-intended (voter's device correctly encodes their intent), recorded-as-cast (the system correctly records the encrypted vote), and counted-as-recorded (the tally correctly reflects recorded votes). The circom circuit provided only addresses eligibility and vote validity, not the crucial tally correctness proof which is where the cryptographic complexity lies for universal verifiability.\n\nRegarding ZK proof selection, the manuscript should address that Groth16 (used in many MACI deployments) requires a per-circuit trusted setup, which is problematic for upgradeable voting systems. PLONK with a universal trusted setup or STARKs with transparent setup may be preferable despite higher verification costs. The claim of '60-80% verification cost reduction' from ZK implementations needs citation and clarification\u2014compared to what baseline?\n\nThe homomorphic encryption discussion mentions Paillier and ElGamal but doesn't address the critical distinction: Paillier is additively homomorphic (suitable for tallying) while ElGamal requires re-encryption mixnets for privacy. The circuit example uses ElGamal encryption but doesn't explain how tallying would work without decryption, which is the key advantage of homomorphic schemes.\n\nFinally, the manuscript should engage with the impossibility results in the literature: Benaloh showed that unconditional receipt-freeness is impossible with untrusted voting devices, and this has direct implications for browser-based blockchain voting where the voter's device generates the ZK proof.",

The reviewers unanimously acknowledge the manuscript's strengths in providing well-structured taxonomies, practical code examples, and coverage of real-world deployments (Gitcoin, MakerDAO, Optimism). The comparative matrices and architectural diagrams effectively communicate implementation patterns and tradeoffs.\n\nHowever, all three reviewers identify significant gaps that undermine the manuscript's claims to comprehensiveness and rigor. The security analysis is notably superficial: Reviewer 2 highlights critical omissions regarding MEV attack vectors, sophisticated Sybil resistance mechanisms, and liveness/censorship guarantees\u2014all essential considerations for production voting systems. Reviewer 3 notes that the cryptographic treatment conflates distinct security properties (individual vs. universal vs. end-to-end verifiability) and fails to distinguish between ZK proof systems with fundamentally different trust assumptions. Reviewer 1's concern about unsubstantiated gas cost claims is particularly damaging, as efficiency comparisons are central to the manuscript's contribution yet lack empirical validation.\n\nThe manuscript has clear potential but requires substantial strengthening in three areas: (1) rigorous empirical validation of gas cost claims using standard profiling tools, (2) formalized threat modeling that addresses MEV, Sybil resistance, and liveness guarantees with appropriate depth, and (3) more precise cryptographic analysis distinguishing proof systems and verifiability properties.

The SSTORE analysis correctly identifies cold/warm access patterns, but doesn't explore the implications of EIP-1153 transient storage for commit-reveal schemes where commitments could be stored transiently during a single block's voting window, potentially reducing costs by 90%+. The MACI gas analysis is commendably honest about real-world costs, but the manuscript should clarify that the Poseidon hash used in MACI is not a native EVM precompile - it's implemented in Solidity with ~15,000 gas per hash, which explains much of the cost overhead compared to native keccak256. For the upgrade patterns section, the critical missing piece is how to handle the state migration problem: if a voting contract has 10,000 voter commitments in a mapping, upgrading the implementation doesn't migrate that data, but changing the storage layout in the new implementation will cause slot collisions. The manuscript should recommend immutable storage layouts or explicit migration functions with gas cost estimates. The optimistic voting gas estimate of 100K-150K for verification seems low if fraud proofs require re-executing vote tallies on-chain - this needs clarification on what computation the fraud proof actually verifies. Finally, the comparison table's methodology column is good practice, but the table itself appears truncated and the cost model clarification sentence is cut off, suggesting incomplete revision.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic voting protocols perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge but falls short of the rigor needed for its ambitious claims. The treatment of ballot secrecy is particularly concerning: the paper correctly notes that commit-reveal exposes votes during reveal, but then recommends commit-reveal combined with ZKPs without clearly explaining the construction. A proper privacy-preserving voting scheme would use homomorphic tallying (as briefly mentioned with Paillier/ElGamal) or mixnets, not commit-reveal. The MACI analysis is the strongest section, correctly identifying that computational privacy depends on coordinator honesty - but this should lead to a stronger recommendation for threshold decryption variants like MACI with distributed coordinators.\n\nThe verifiability analysis conflates three distinct properties (cast-as-intended, recorded-as-cast, counted-as-recorded) without adequately addressing how each is achieved. For instance, the paper notes cast-as-intended 'depends on client software' but doesn't discuss cryptographic approaches like Benaloh challenges or code voting that can provide stronger guarantees. The end-to-end verifiability claims for various systems need more careful treatment.\n\nThe ZK-proof discussion would benefit from concrete circuit analysis. Stating that Groth16 verification costs '~200,000 gas' is meaningless without specifying the circuit - a simple membership proof differs enormously from a full vote validity proof with eligibility checks. The paper should analyze specific voting circuits: proving vote is in valid range, proving voter eligibility via Merkle membership, proving no double-voting, etc. Additionally, the prover-side costs are dismissed too quickly - for voter-generated proofs, prover efficiency directly impacts usability and may require trusted hardware or delegation, each with security implications.\n\nThe manuscript would be significantly strengthened by: (1) a formal security model with explicit adversary capabilities and winning conditions, (2) concrete protocol specifications rather than high-level descriptions, (3) security proofs or at minimum security arguments with explicit assumptions, and (4) a clearer separation between what is theoretically achievable versus practically deployed.

The addition of Section 3 with explicit adversary models and MEV attack vectors addresses a critical gap from typical voting system analyses. The distinction between passive, active, and coercive adversaries with PPT bounds is appropriate, and the collusion models provide a useful framework.\n\nHowever, several security-critical issues require attention. First, the MEV analysis, while comprehensive in taxonomy, lacks economic modeling. The statement that '30% of Ethereum blocks contain MEV' is cited from Flashbots data but not connected to voting-specific attack incentives. A governance vote controlling $100M creates MEV opportunity, but what's the expected profit margin after accounting for failed attempts, gas costs, and detection risk? Without this, protocol designers cannot properly set bond sizes or challenge periods.\n\nSecond, the Sybil resistance analysis presents a layered scoring approach but doesn't analyze it adversarially. An attacker will optimize across the cheapest identity verification methods. If government ID provides 10 points and the threshold is 15, an attacker needs only 5 additional points from potentially gameable on-chain history or staking. The formal bounds mentioned (fp/fn tradeoffs) are not connected to the proposed implementation.\n\nThird, the MACI security analysis correctly identifies coordinator trust as a limitation but underestimates the severity of coordinator-coercer collusion. In this scenario, the coordinator can: (1) decrypt all votes, (2) monitor for key-change transactions in real-time, (3) inform the coercer before the voting deadline. The key-change mechanism provides no protection here. The manuscript should explicitly state this limitation and analyze threshold coordinator schemes quantitatively - how does security degrade as t approaches n in a t-of-n threshold scheme?\n\nThe liveness analysis for L2s is valuable but should include recent developments like based sequencing and shared sequencer networks that may improve censorship resistance. Additionally, the forced inclusion mechanism analysis should consider adversarial scenarios where the L1 itself experiences congestion during critical voting periods.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from a unified security comparison table mapping each system to explicit adversary capabilities it resists, similar to the gas comparison tables provided. This would make the security tradeoffs immediately actionable for practitioners.",

Most critically, the manuscript lacks formal rigor in its security claims: game-based definitions for ballot secrecy and coercion-resistance are absent, the claim that commit-reveal with ZKPs offers a 'balanced approach' is insufficiently justified (since commit-reveal fundamentally fails ballot secrecy during reveal), and the Sybil resistance scoring system appears arbitrary without adversarial cost analysis.

The formal adversary taxonomy is well-constructed, and I particularly appreciate the explicit computational bounds and the acknowledgment that all privacy guarantees are computational rather than information-theoretic. The MEV analysis is practical and actionable, with the economic break-even calculations providing clear guidance for practitioners.\n\nHowever, several security-critical areas need deeper treatment. First, the interaction between MEV and voting in the presence of proposer-builder separation (PBS) is not adequately addressed. Under PBS, block builders see all private mempool transactions from services like Flashbots Protect, creating a new trust assumption that isn't captured in your threat model. Second, the Sybil resistance section, while comprehensive, doesn't address the temporal dynamics of identity attacks - an adversary could slowly accumulate legitimate-seeming identities over months before a critical vote, making the cost model C(k) time-dependent in ways not captured.\n\nThe L2 liveness analysis correctly identifies forced inclusion delays but misses several critical attack vectors: (1) data availability attacks where the sequencer withholds transaction data, making it impossible to reconstruct state for fraud proofs; (2) griefing attacks on optimistic rollups where an adversary submits invalid fraud proofs to delay finality during voting periods; (3) the interaction between voting deadlines and rollup finality - a vote submitted 1 hour before deadline on an optimistic rollup isn't actually 'final' for 7 days. The manuscript should provide concrete recommendations for how voting periods should be structured relative to rollup finality assumptions.\n\nFinally, the coercion-resistance analysis of MACI is good but should be extended to cover the 'bribery market' attack where a smart contract offers payment for key-change proofs, effectively creating a trustless vote-buying mechanism that circumvents MACI's protections. This is a known attack vector that deserves explicit treatment given MACI's prominence in the manuscript.",

The formal definitions in Section 2.1.1 are well-constructed, though Definition 4 (coercion-resistance) would benefit from the full JCJ formalization including the 'fake credential' mechanism that enables the counter-strategy. The paper correctly identifies that MACI's key-change approach is an approximation of coercion-resistance, but the analysis should go further: even without coordinator collusion, a sophisticated coercer can implement a 'monitoring contract' that tracks all transactions from registered voters and flags any activity during the voting period as suspicious. This fundamentally limits MACI's coercion-resistance to scenarios where voters can plausibly deny that any transaction they made was a key change.\n\nThe ZK-proof efficiency analysis is practical and useful, but the paper should address the verification of proof correctness from the voter's perspective. When a voter generates a ZK proof client-side, how do they know the proof actually encodes their intended vote? This is the 'cast-as-intended' problem, and solutions like Benaloh challenges (where the voter can request the system 'open' a subset of ballots to verify correct encoding) don't translate directly to the ZK setting. The paper should discuss approaches like verifiable computation on the client side or trusted execution environments.\n\nFor the homomorphic encryption schemes discussed, the paper should elaborate on how universal verifiability is achieved. Simply stating that 'decryption reveals only the final tally' is insufficient - observers need cryptographic proof that the decryption was performed correctly. For threshold ElGamal, this typically involves each decryption share coming with a Chaum-Pedersen proof of correct partial decryption. This is a non-trivial gas cost that should be included in the efficiency analysis.\n\nThe proof aggregation discussion via SnarkPack is valuable, but note that aggregated proofs still require the original proofs to be valid - the aggregation doesn't hide invalid proofs. For voting, this means individual vote validity must still be checked somewhere, either on-chain before aggregation or within the aggregation circuit itself, which significantly increases circuit complexity.",

The gas cost table for opcodes is accurate and the distinction between cold/warm storage access is correctly emphasized - this is crucial since a voting contract accessing voter state will see dramatically different costs depending on access patterns within a transaction. However, the per-vote cost claims need more substantiation. For instance, the 48,000-65,000 gas range for 'traditional on-chain voting' likely assumes a single SSTORE for vote recording plus some validation logic, but this varies enormously based on implementation: does the contract use a mapping (cheaper) or array (more expensive for enumeration)? Is there a snapshot lookup (additional SLOAD)? Are there event emissions (375 + 8*bytes gas)? The MACI figures of 450,000-550,000 gas are plausible for signUp + publishMessage but should be broken down by operation. The upgrade pattern section is genuinely useful, particularly the storage gap pattern and the noActiveVotes modifier - these are production-relevant concerns. However, I'd recommend adding analysis of the UUPS vs Transparent proxy gas overhead in the context of high-frequency voting operations: the ~500 gas difference per call becomes significant when processing thousands of votes. The EIP-7201 namespaced storage pattern mentioned deserves expansion as it's becoming the standard approach for avoiding storage collisions. The missing on-chain vs off-chain comparison is a significant gap given it was highlighted as a key focus area. A complete analysis should quantify: (1) full on-chain tallying costs O(n) in votes with ~5,000-10,000 gas per vote aggregation, (2) optimistic approaches with ~200,000 gas for fraud proof verification but O(1) happy-path costs, (3) ZK-verified off-chain computation with ~200,000-350,000 gas for proof verification regardless of vote count.

        "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive treatment of blockchain voting security with notable strengths in formal threat modeling, economic analysis of MEV attacks, and practical gas cost considerations for EVM-compatible systems. All three reviewers converge on similar assessments (7.2/10 average), recognizing the work's solid theoretical foundations\u2014particularly the game-based security definitions, impossibility result acknowledgments, and rigorous Sybil resistance analysis. The formal decomposition of end-to-end verifiability and the practical MEV break-even calculations demonstrate both academic rigor and real-world applicability.\n\nHowever, reviewers unanimously identify a critical structural issue: the manuscript is truncated mid-section (Section 3.4.3 on Threshold Coordinator Architecture), leaving essential analysis incomplete. Beyond this obvious gap, substantive technical concerns emerge across reviews: the coercion-resistance analysis for MACI overlooks timing attacks from blockchain observation; cross-domain MEV attacks and L1/L2 composability vulnerabilities receive insufficient attention; and the empirical methodology for gas cost measurements lacks reproducibility details. The trusted setup ceremony implications for ZK-proof systems and the 'malicious client' problem for vote encoding verification represent additional gaps that weaken the otherwise strong cryptographic treatment.\n\nGiven this is the final review round and the core contributions are sound, the identified issues are addressable through targeted revisions rather than fundamental restructuring. The manuscript would benefit the community once completed, but publication in its current truncated state would be inappropriate.",
        "key_strengths": [
          "Excellent formal threat model with explicit adversary types and game-based security definitions that properly distinguish ballot secrecy, receipt-freeness, and coercion-resistance",
          "Strong economic analysis of MEV attacks with concrete break-even calculations and practical mitigation strategies including ordered reveal commitments",
          "Comprehensive and accurate gas cost analysis with proper treatment of EIP-2929 cold/warm storage patterns and realistic ZK-proof verification costs"

        "key_weaknesses": [
          "Manuscript is truncated mid-section, leaving threshold coordinator analysis, liveness guarantees, and on-chain vs off-chain tradeoffs incomplete",
          "Coercion-resistance analysis for MACI is incomplete\u2014missing timing attack vectors where adversaries monitor blockchain state during voting periods",
          "Empirical methodology for gas measurements lacks reproducibility details (compiler settings, test contracts, mainnet fork vs isolated tests)"
        ],
        "required_changes": [
          "Complete Section 3.4.3 on Threshold Coordinator Architecture including coordinator failure recovery, key resharing protocols, and fallback decryption mechanisms",
          "Add methodology section specifying Solidity compiler version, optimizer settings, test contract implementations, and measurement conditions for all claimed gas costs",
          "Expand MACI coercion-resistance analysis to formally model adversaries with full blockchain observability and characterize actual information leakage under different key-change strategies",
          "Address the 'malicious client' problem for vote encoding verification, discussing approaches like Benaloh challenges or deterministic builds"
        ],
        "recommendation": "The manuscript makes valuable contributions to blockchain voting security but cannot be accepted in its current truncated form. Authors should: (1) complete all unfinished sections, particularly the threshold coordinator analysis; (2) add a reproducibility-focused methodology section for empirical claims; (3) strengthen the coercion-resistance analysis with formal treatment of timing attacks; and (4) address verifiable vote encoding. These revisions are well-scoped and should be achievable without restructuring the core contributions. Upon satisfactory completion, this work would merit acceptance.",
