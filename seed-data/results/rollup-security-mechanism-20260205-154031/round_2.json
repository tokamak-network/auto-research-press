However, the treatment of DA sampling security assumptions and sequencer-L1 interaction risks could be more rigorous, and several important edge cases in the consensus-DA interface remain underexplored.",

        "The analysis of blob data availability guarantees is incomplete - the 18-day pruning window creates a critical dependency on archival infrastructure that is not adequately addressed from a security perspective",
        "Sequencer-L1 proposer collusion analysis understates the risk from MEV-boost and builder centralization, where a smaller number of entities control block construction than the validator count suggests",
        "Missing rigorous treatment of DA withholding attacks during the transition period between blob posting and DAS verification, particularly for light clients"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add analysis of the security implications when blob data expires but rollup state reconstruction is still needed - what are the trust assumptions for archival nodes and how does this affect the 'inherit L1 security' claim?",
        "Expand the sequencer collusion section to account for builder centralization (currently ~3 builders produce >90% of blocks) and PBS dynamics that could enable more practical censorship attacks than the validator-count analysis suggests",
        "Include discussion of the 'fisherman's dilemma' in DAS - the game-theoretic challenges of incentivizing sufficient sampling when individual samplers bear costs but security is a public good"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain consensus and data availability perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the core mechanisms but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive security analysis. The DAS section correctly identifies the honest minority assumption but does not adequately explore the network-level requirements for this assumption to hold - specifically, the peer-to-peer protocol requirements for random sampling to be truly random and resistant to eclipse attacks. The treatment of L1 finality inheritance is generally accurate, but the manuscript conflates different notions of finality without sufficient precision; for instance, the claim that L2 state 'inherits cryptoeconomic security' from finalized L1 blocks requires careful qualification about what exactly is inherited (data availability vs. execution correctness vs. ordering). The external DA layer comparison is useful but would benefit from formal security reduction arguments - under what precise assumptions does using Celestia provide equivalent security to Ethereum DA? The 2/3 honest stake assumption for Celestia is stated but not compared rigorously to Ethereum's own BFT assumptions. Additionally, the manuscript should address the composability of security assumptions when rollups use external DA - the security is not simply the minimum of L1 and DA layer security but involves complex interactions. The forced inclusion mechanism analysis is solid but should discuss the economic sustainability of this escape hatch under sustained attack conditions and whether the 24-hour delay is sufficient given potential L1 congestion scenarios more extreme than those modeled.",

        "Expand the soundness analysis to include concrete security bounds: for Groth16, discuss the reduction tightness to q-SDH; for STARKs, provide explicit FRI soundness calculations with typical parameter choices (e.g., blowup factor 8, 30 queries)",
        "Complete Section 4.5 with rigorous treatment of recursive proof security, including: (1) the distinction between IVC and PCD security models, (2) soundness preservation under composition, and (3) specific vulnerabilities like the Nova folding scheme's recent soundness issues",
        "Add formal treatment of the extraction guarantees in the context of rollup state transitions\u2014specifically, how the extractor's running time bounds affect practical security and whether current implementations achieve simulation-extractability"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic proof systems perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational understanding but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive security analysis. The formal security definitions in Section 4.1 are correctly stated, and I appreciate the explicit distinction between soundness and knowledge soundness\u2014this is a common source of confusion that the authors handle well. However, the analysis would benefit from more precise treatment of concrete security. For instance, when discussing STARK soundness, the formula 'error \u2248 max(1/|F|, (1/\u03c1)^q)' is a simplification that ignores the grinding attack mitigation and the proof-of-work component in the FRI protocol. The manuscript should clarify whether this is the proven bound or an approximation.\n\nThe discussion of algebraic hash functions (Poseidon, Rescue) correctly notes the reduced cryptanalytic scrutiny compared to SHA-256/Keccak, but should be more specific about the security margins. Poseidon's security relies on the difficulty of solving high-degree polynomial systems over finite fields, and the conservative parameter choices (wider state widths) provide security margins against potential improvements in Gr\u00f6bner basis algorithms\u2014this could be quantified more precisely.\n\nThe treatment of trusted setups is adequate but misses important nuances. For PLONK's universal setup, the manuscript should discuss the relationship between the maximum circuit size supported and the SRS (Structured Reference String) size, as this has practical implications for which circuits can be proven. Additionally, the updatable property of PLONK setups deserves more attention\u2014specifically, the security model where adversaries may have contributed to the setup and the implications for simulation-extractability.\n\nMost critically, the empty Section 4.5 on proof recursion represents a significant gap. Recursive proof composition is central to modern ZK-rollup architectures (used by zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, and others for proof aggregation), and it introduces subtle security considerations. The manuscript should address: (1) whether the recursion is achieved through cycles of curves (as in Pasta curves) or accumulation schemes (as in Nova/Sangria), (2) the soundness preservation guarantees under recursive composition, and (3) recent vulnerabilities discovered in folding schemes that highlight the complexity of achieving secure recursion. Without this section, the manuscript's coverage of ZK-rollup security is materially incomplete.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a smart contract security perspective, this manuscript has a notable blind spot around the actual contract-level attack surfaces that have historically caused the most damage in L2 systems. The bridge contracts\u2014which handle deposits, withdrawals, and cross-layer message passing\u2014are mentioned only tangentially despite being the primary interface where user funds are at risk. The manuscript should analyze the canonical bridge architecture: how L1\u2192L2 deposits are verified (typically via Merkle proofs against the L1 state root), how L2\u2192L1 withdrawals are processed (including the withdrawal proof structure and verification logic), and the specific vulnerabilities that arise from message serialization, signature verification, and state proof validation. Historical incidents like the Optimism infinite mint bug (2022, related to SELFDESTRUCT handling in cross-layer messages) or the various bridge exploits affecting non-rollup L2s provide valuable case studies. The withdrawal mechanism deserves particular scrutiny: in optimistic rollups, users must wait for the challenge period AND successfully submit a withdrawal proof that passes on-chain verification. What happens if the withdrawal contract has a bug in proof verification? What are the censorship vectors specific to withdrawal transactions? For ZK rollups, how is the withdrawal proof tied to the validity proof, and what are the failure modes? The upgrade governance section is also critically underdeveloped. Current rollups maintain significant upgrade authority\u2014Arbitrum's Security Council can perform emergency upgrades with a 9/12 multisig, Optimism has similar structures, and zkSync Era maintains upgrade keys. These represent real trust assumptions that users must accept, and the manuscript should analyze: timelock durations, multisig threshold configurations, scope of upgradeable components (can the bridge logic be upgraded? the verifier contract?), and historical upgrade incidents. The emergency pause functionality present in most rollup contracts also deserves analysis\u2014who can pause, under what conditions, and what are the implications for user fund accessibility during a pause?",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a technically competent overview of rollup security mechanisms that has earned consistent scores across all three reviewers (7.2/10 average). The reviewers unanimously recognize the manuscript's strengths in explaining core concepts: data availability sampling mechanisms, cryptographic assumption hierarchies, fraud proof systems, and finality inheritance models. The writing is clear, the technical accuracy is solid, and the comparative analyses (particularly the finality hierarchy table and external DA layer comparison) provide genuine value to practitioners and researchers.\n\nHowever, all three reviewers identify substantive gaps that prevent acceptance in the current form. The most critical omission is the lack of bridge contract and withdrawal security analysis (Reviewer 3), which represents the historically most exploited attack surface in L2 systems\u2014an inexcusable gap for a comprehensive security analysis. Additionally, the incomplete Section 4.5 on proof recursion (Reviewer 2) and the underspecified blob data archival security implications (Reviewer 1) represent significant holes in the technical coverage. The manuscript also consistently underweights practical attack vectors: builder centralization effects on censorship resistance, upgrade governance vulnerabilities, and the game-theoretic challenges of DAS incentivization.\n\nDespite these gaps, the foundation is strong and the issues are addressable. The manuscript does not suffer from fundamental methodological flaws or technical inaccuracies\u2014rather, it requires expansion and deepening of coverage in specific areas. Given this is Round 2 of 3, the authors have one revision cycle to address these concerns, which should be achievable given the clear and actionable nature of the reviewer feedback.",

    "recommendation": "The manuscript provides a solid technical foundation but requires targeted expansion to meet the standard for a comprehensive rollup security analysis. Authors should prioritize: (1) adding bridge/withdrawal security content as this is the most critical gap, (2) completing the proof recursion section with formal rigor, and (3) strengthening the practical attack surface analysis to account for real-world centralization vectors. The core technical content is accurate and well-written\u2014these additions will elevate the work from a good overview to a definitive reference. Aim to add approximately 4-6 pages of new content addressing these specific areas, with particular attention to including concrete security bounds, historical case studies, and explicit trust assumption articulation.",
