        "Section 5.2 on bridge attack vectors conflates non-rollup bridge exploits (Ronin, Wormhole, Nomad) with rollup-specific risks without adequately distinguishing the fundamentally different trust models\u2014Ronin was a sidechain validator compromise, not a rollup bridge vulnerability",
        "Insufficient technical depth on cross-layer message verification: the manuscript does not explain how L2\u2192L1 messages are authenticated, the role of output roots in withdrawal proofs, or the specific Merkle proof structures used to verify withdrawal eligibility",
        "Challenge period adequacy analysis is superficial\u2014no discussion of the game-theoretic assumptions underlying the 7-day period, no analysis of whether this is sufficient given current L1 congestion patterns, gas price volatility, or the capital efficiency tradeoffs users face"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated subsection on cross-layer message verification that details: (1) how OutputRoot commitments encode L2\u2192L1 message inclusion, (2) the specific proof structure for withdrawal claims, (3) the re-execution requirements for fraud proof generation, and (4) known vulnerabilities in message relay contracts",
        "Strengthen the challenge period analysis with quantitative modeling: calculate the minimum capital required to profitably attack given current stake levels, analyze historical L1 congestion events that could impede fraud proof submission, and discuss proposals for dynamic challenge periods",
        "Replace or supplement the non-rollup bridge exploit examples with rollup-specific incidents: the Optimism infinite mint vulnerability (2022), Arbitrum sequencer inbox vulnerabilities, and zkSync's ECRECOVER issues deserve deeper technical analysis of root causes and how bridge contract design could have prevented them"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a smart contract security perspective, this manuscript correctly identifies bridges as the primary attack surface but fails to provide the technical depth necessary for security practitioners. The withdrawal mechanism security analysis is particularly thin\u2014while the 7-day challenge period is mentioned repeatedly, there is no rigorous examination of whether this duration is adequate under adversarial conditions. Consider: what happens if an attacker can sustain L1 gas prices above 500 gwei for 7 days? What is the minimum honest verifier capital requirement to guarantee fraud proof submission? The manuscript should model these scenarios quantitatively.\n\nThe cross-layer message verification section needs substantial expansion. Currently, the deposit and withdrawal flows are presented at a high level without explaining the cryptographic verification that occurs. For withdrawals specifically: how does the L1 bridge contract verify that a withdrawal was legitimately initiated on L2? The answer involves OutputRoot commitments, storage proofs, and message passing contracts\u2014none of which are adequately explained. Security researchers need to understand these mechanisms to identify vulnerabilities.\n\nRegarding upgrade governance risks, the manuscript correctly notes timelock durations but doesn't analyze the practical security implications. A 12-day timelock is only useful if users (1) monitor governance proposals, (2) understand the implications of proposed changes, and (3) can exit within the timelock window. Given that optimistic rollup withdrawals themselves take 7 days, users effectively have only 5 days to react to a malicious upgrade proposal on Arbitrum. This creates a race condition that deserves analysis.\n\nThe Security Council discussion should include more detail on the specific powers these councils hold, the conditions under which they can bypass timelocks, and historical instances where emergency powers were exercised. The Optimism Security Council's ability to override the 7-day timelock is a significant trust assumption that warrants deeper examination.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from a threat model that explicitly considers bridge contract upgradeability as an attack vector. If a Security Council can upgrade bridge contracts with reduced timelock during 'emergencies,' what prevents a compromised council from declaring a false emergency and draining the bridge? This is arguably the most significant centralization risk in current rollup deployments and deserves dedicated analysis.",

        "Provide formal analysis of censorship resistance under various adversarial models\u2014specifically, analyze the game theory of forced inclusion when both sequencer and L1 proposers may be adversarial, and quantify the actual censorship resistance guarantees"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain consensus and data availability perspective, this manuscript has notable gaps that undermine its claim to be a 'comprehensive analysis.' The treatment of data availability is particularly concerning. While the paper correctly identifies DA as 'arguably the most critical security property,' it fails to explain *how* DA guarantees are actually achieved at scale. There is no mention of Data Availability Sampling, which is the key innovation enabling DA to scale without requiring every node to download all data. The security model of DAS\u2014requiring only an honest minority of light clients performing random sampling\u2014is fundamentally different from the full download model implied in the text. This omission is significant given that Danksharding (full implementation of EIP-4844's vision) relies entirely on DAS.\n\nThe finality analysis is similarly superficial. The manuscript states that rollups 'inherit security guarantees from underlying Layer 1 networks' but doesn't rigorously define what this inheritance means. Ethereum's Gasper consensus provides finality after ~2 epochs (~12 minutes), but L2 transactions receive 'soft confirmations' from sequencers within seconds. The security properties of these soft confirmations\u2014and what happens during L1 reorgs\u2014deserve careful analysis. The paper should distinguish between: (1) sequencer confirmations (trust sequencer), (2) L1 inclusion (trust L1 consensus), and (3) L1 finality (cryptoeconomic finality). Each has different security properties.\n\nOn sequencer centralization, the forced inclusion mechanism is mentioned but not analyzed rigorously. The 24-hour timeout in Arbitrum is stated as fact, but what are the actual security guarantees? If an adversary controls both the sequencer and has significant L1 proposer power, can they extend censorship beyond this window? The paper should model the adversarial capabilities required for sustained censorship and quantify the cost. Additionally, the discussion of decentralized sequencer solutions (Espresso, Astria) lacks analysis of their consensus mechanisms' security properties\u2014what are the BFT assumptions, what happens under network partitions, and how do these compare to L1 consensus security?\n\nThe external DA layer analysis is also incomplete. Stating that users 'must trust the DA layer's consensus mechanism' is accurate but insufficient. What are the specific security assumptions of Celestia's consensus? How does EigenDA's restaking model affect DA guarantees? What are the implications of DA layer liveness failures for rollup security? These questions are central to evaluating the security tradeoffs of different DA strategies.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of cryptographic proof systems, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening in several areas. First, the soundness discussion conflates different notions\u2014computational soundness (no PPT adversary can produce accepting proofs for false statements) versus knowledge soundness (the prover must 'know' a witness). For ZK-rollups, knowledge soundness is critical because we need assurance that valid proofs correspond to actual valid state transitions, not merely that invalid proofs are hard to forge. The manuscript should clarify that SNARKs like Groth16 achieve knowledge soundness under the Knowledge of Exponent assumption, which is non-falsifiable and stronger than standard assumptions.\n\nThe treatment of algebraically-structured hash functions (Poseidon, Rescue) correctly notes reduced cryptanalytic scrutiny but fails to quantify the security margins or discuss the Gr\u00f6bner basis attacks and algebraic attacks that have been studied. The claim of '128-bit security' for these functions should reference specific security analyses and note that security parameters are often set conservatively due to uncertainty.\n\nThe prover/verifier tradeoff table is useful but oversimplified. For instance, STARK verification costs depend heavily on the FRI parameters (blowup factor, number of queries), and the stated '1-2M gas' range obscures significant variability. Similarly, 'prover time: seconds-minutes' for STARKs versus 'minutes-hours' for SNARKs doesn't capture that STARK provers have better parallelization properties but worse constant factors for small circuits.\n\nThe multi-prover security analysis claiming multiplicative security composition is mathematically naive\u2014this only holds if proof systems are truly independent, which they rarely are (shared field arithmetic, similar constraint systems, common implementation libraries). A more rigorous analysis would discuss common-mode failures and the actual independence assumptions required.\n\nFinally, the manuscript should address the soundness implications of proof recursion and aggregation more carefully. Recursive SNARKs (used in zkSync's Boojum and Polygon's proof composition) introduce additional cryptographic assumptions and potential soundness degradation through composition. The security of aggregated proofs depends on the accumulation scheme's soundness, which deserves dedicated analysis.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript provides a well-organized and accessible survey of rollup security mechanisms, demonstrating solid breadth across multiple security dimensions including bridge architectures, data availability solutions, and proof system paradigms. All three reviewers consistently praised the clear taxonomic structure, practical coverage of real-world implementations, and honest acknowledgment of current trust assumptions in deployed systems. The writing quality and organizational clarity are publication-ready.\n\nHowever, the reviewers unanimously identified a critical gap: the manuscript lacks the technical depth expected for a comprehensive security analysis in this domain. Reviewer 1 notes that bridge attack vector analysis conflates fundamentally different trust models (rollup bridges vs. sidechain bridges like Ronin), while cross-layer message verification mechanics remain unexplained. Reviewer 2 highlights the complete absence of Data Availability Sampling discussion\u2014a foundational concept for understanding DA scaling\u2014and oversimplified treatment of L1-L2 finality inheritance. Reviewer 3 raises concerns about superficial soundness analysis and incomplete cryptographic assumption treatment, noting that claims like '128-bit security' lack the formal rigor to be meaningful. The consistent novelty scores of 5/10 and rigor scores of 5-6/10 across all reviewers indicate that while the survey covers known territory adequately, it does not advance understanding sufficiently for expert readers.\n\nThe manuscript occupies an uncomfortable middle ground: too shallow for security researchers and practitioners who need actionable technical details, yet potentially too specialized for a general blockchain audience. With substantial revision to address the technical depth issues\u2014particularly around DAS mechanisms, formal soundness definitions, and rollup-specific vulnerability analysis\u2014this could become a valuable contribution. The foundational structure is sound, but the current version reads more as an extended tutorial than a rigorous security analysis.",
