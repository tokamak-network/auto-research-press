      "detailed_feedback": "From a smart contract security perspective, this manuscript demonstrates strong foundational understanding but has significant gaps in areas most relevant to practical bridge and withdrawal security. The challenge period analysis is rigorous and the quantitative approach to gas price attacks and builder centralization is commendable. However, the document's treatment of bridge contracts\u2014historically the most exploited component of L2 systems\u2014is notably thin. There is no discussion of cross-layer message verification patterns, the security of deposit/withdrawal proof verification, or the specific vulnerabilities that have led to billions in losses (Ronin, Wormhole, Nomad). The withdrawal mechanism security section promised in Section 5 appears to be missing from the provided text. For upgrade governance, the manuscript mentions 'training wheels' and security councils but provides no analysis of actual governance configurations, timelock durations, or the conditions under which emergency interventions can bypass normal security guarantees. The incomplete STARK soundness analysis is concerning for a document claiming comprehensive coverage. I recommend completing the missing sections and adding substantial content on bridge contract verification logic, withdrawal proof security, and upgrade mechanism trust assumptions before this can be considered comprehensive for smart contract security assessment.",

        "The STARK soundness analysis is incomplete (manuscript cuts off), and the existing proof system taxonomy lacks critical details on concrete security levels, particularly the relationship between field size, number of queries, and achieved soundness for FRI-based systems",
        "The fraud proof security analysis lacks formal treatment of the interactive bisection protocol's soundness guarantees - specifically, no analysis of how the O(log n) round complexity affects security under network delay assumptions or adversarial scheduling",

        "Include analysis of proof system attack vectors observed in practice: soundness bugs in circuit implementations (e.g., the 2022 Zcash vulnerability), trusted setup ceremony security for Groth16-based systems, and the security composition when using recursive SNARKs for proof aggregation"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic proof systems perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the theoretical foundations but falls short of the rigor needed for authoritative security analysis. The formal definitions in Section 4.1 are correct, and I appreciate the explicit statement of knowledge soundness as distinct from computational soundness - this is indeed the relevant property for rollup state transitions. However, the treatment of concrete security is inconsistent. For Groth16, you correctly note the tight reduction to q-SDH, but for PLONK you mention 'security loss' from Fiat-Shamir without quantifying it (the Attema-Fehr-Kloo\u00df bound gives roughly sqrt(Q) loss for Q queries). The STARK section appears truncated, which is problematic given STARKs' prominence in production systems. A complete analysis should address the FRI soundness error (roughly \u03c1^t for proximity parameter \u03c1 and t queries), the security implications of the conjectured vs. proven proximity gaps, and how production systems like StarkNet balance prover efficiency against soundness error. The fraud proof analysis, while practically oriented, lacks cryptographic formalization. The interactive bisection protocol is essentially an argument system where the verifier (L1 contract) is convinced of computation correctness. This should be analyzed as such, with explicit security definitions and reductions. What are the synchrony assumptions? What happens if the adversary can delay messages? The 'O(log n) rounds' complexity is stated but not connected to security parameters. Additionally, the manuscript should address proof system implementation vulnerabilities. The Zcash Sapling vulnerability (CVE-2019-7167) demonstrated that even well-audited circuits can contain soundness bugs. For rollups processing billions in value, the gap between theoretical soundness and implementation correctness is a critical attack surface deserving dedicated analysis.",

        "The finality hierarchy table oversimplifies L1-L2 security relationships - for instance, 'L1 finality' at 12-15 minutes assumes no inactivity leak scenarios, and the interaction between L1 reorgs and L2 state during the pre-finality window deserves more rigorous treatment"

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain consensus and data availability perspective, this manuscript demonstrates strong technical understanding of the core challenges. The DAS section is particularly well-executed, correctly identifying that the transformation from binary DA to probabilistic guarantees introduces novel attack vectors around selective unavailability and sampling bias. The treatment of the fisherman's dilemma as a public goods problem is apt and the proposed mitigations are reasonable. However, I would push for more quantitative analysis here - what sampling density is actually required for various security levels, and how does this interact with network latency assumptions?\n\nThe blob expiration analysis is a valuable contribution that many analyses overlook. The identification that rollup security degrades to 'trust in archival infrastructure' after 18 days is correct and important. However, the mitigation strategies listed are somewhat hand-wavy - for instance, claiming that 'decentralized storage networks with economic incentives' solve this problem ignores the significant gap between Filecoin's retrieval guarantees and the availability requirements for fraud proof generation.\n\nThe L1-L2 finality relationship section is good but could be more precise. The statement that L2 'inherits' L1 finality needs careful qualification - what exactly is inherited is the ordering finality, but the execution correctness guarantee has different properties depending on the rollup type. For optimistic rollups, even after L1 finality, the execution correctness remains probabilistic until challenge period completion. The manuscript acknowledges this but the finality hierarchy table could be clearer.\n\nThe builder centralization analysis is timely and important. The revised censorship analysis correctly identifies that PBS dynamics create a more concentrated attack surface. However, the analysis should also consider the role of relays in the PBS pipeline - relay censorship (as observed with OFAC-compliant relays) represents another centralization vector that affects fraud proof inclusion guarantees.\n\nOne significant gap is the lack of discussion on proposer timing games and their interaction with rollup security. Proposers can delay block publication to extract additional MEV, and this timing flexibility could be exploited to delay fraud proof inclusion in ways not captured by the current analysis. Similarly, the interaction between L1 consensus instability (e.g., during network partitions or high-latency periods) and rollup security guarantees deserves attention.\n\nThe external DA layer analysis has improved but remains the weakest section from a consensus perspective. The security composition is not merely about which layer to break - it's about the correlation structure of failures. If the same economic actors stake on both Ethereum and Celestia (which is increasingly common with restaking), the independence assumption underlying the 'break either one' security argument weakens. A proper analysis would model the correlation structure of validator sets and derive security bounds accordingly.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive analysis of rollup security mechanisms that demonstrates strong technical understanding across multiple domains. All three reviewers acknowledge the work's substantial contributions, particularly in data availability analysis, quantitative security bounds for challenge periods, and formal treatment of validity proof definitions. The average score of 7.1/10 reflects a solid foundation with identifiable gaps that prevent immediate acceptance.\n\nThe most significant concern across all reviews is the incomplete manuscript\u2014the document cuts off mid-section during the STARK soundness analysis, which prevents full evaluation of the ZK-rollup security treatment. Beyond this structural issue, reviewers consistently identify three substantive gaps: (1) insufficient treatment of bridge contract vulnerabilities and withdrawal mechanism security, which Reviewer 1 correctly notes represent the primary historical attack vectors in L2 exploits; (2) incomplete formal treatment of fraud proof protocol soundness and cryptographic security reductions, as emphasized by Reviewer 2; and (3) the need for more rigorous formalization of security composition when external DA layers are involved, per Reviewer 3.\n\nDespite these gaps, the manuscript's core contributions are sound and valuable. The quantitative analysis of challenge period adequacy, the treatment of PBS dynamics and builder centralization, and the DAS security model discussion all represent high-quality technical work. Given this is the final review round and the issues identified are addressable through targeted additions rather than fundamental restructuring, a minor revision is appropriate to bring this work to publication standard.",
