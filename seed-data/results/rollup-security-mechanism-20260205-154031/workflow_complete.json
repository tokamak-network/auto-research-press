          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From a smart contract security perspective, this manuscript correctly identifies bridges as the primary attack surface but fails to provide the technical depth necessary for security practitioners. The withdrawal mechanism security analysis is particularly thin\u2014while the 7-day challenge period is mentioned repeatedly, there is no rigorous examination of whether this duration is adequate under adversarial conditions. Consider: what happens if an attacker can sustain L1 gas prices above 500 gwei for 7 days? What is the minimum honest verifier capital requirement to guarantee fraud proof submission? The manuscript should model these scenarios quantitatively.\n\nThe cross-layer message verification section needs substantial expansion. Currently, the deposit and withdrawal flows are presented at a high level without explaining the cryptographic verification that occurs. For withdrawals specifically: how does the L1 bridge contract verify that a withdrawal was legitimately initiated on L2? The answer involves OutputRoot commitments, storage proofs, and message passing contracts\u2014none of which are adequately explained. Security researchers need to understand these mechanisms to identify vulnerabilities.\n\nRegarding upgrade governance risks, the manuscript correctly notes timelock durations but doesn't analyze the practical security implications. A 12-day timelock is only useful if users (1) monitor governance proposals, (2) understand the implications of proposed changes, and (3) can exit within the timelock window. Given that optimistic rollup withdrawals themselves take 7 days, users effectively have only 5 days to react to a malicious upgrade proposal on Arbitrum. This creates a race condition that deserves analysis.\n\nThe Security Council discussion should include more detail on the specific powers these councils hold, the conditions under which they can bypass timelocks, and historical instances where emergency powers were exercised. The Optimism Security Council's ability to override the 7-day timelock is a significant trust assumption that warrants deeper examination.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from a threat model that explicitly considers bridge contract upgradeability as an attack vector. If a Security Council can upgrade bridge contracts with reduced timelock during 'emergencies,' what prevents a compromised council from declaring a false emergency and draining the bridge? This is arguably the most significant centralization risk in current rollup deployments and deserves dedicated analysis.",

          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain consensus and data availability perspective, this manuscript has notable gaps that undermine its claim to be a 'comprehensive analysis.' The treatment of data availability is particularly concerning. While the paper correctly identifies DA as 'arguably the most critical security property,' it fails to explain *how* DA guarantees are actually achieved at scale. There is no mention of Data Availability Sampling, which is the key innovation enabling DA to scale without requiring every node to download all data. The security model of DAS\u2014requiring only an honest minority of light clients performing random sampling\u2014is fundamentally different from the full download model implied in the text. This omission is significant given that Danksharding (full implementation of EIP-4844's vision) relies entirely on DAS.\n\nThe finality analysis is similarly superficial. The manuscript states that rollups 'inherit security guarantees from underlying Layer 1 networks' but doesn't rigorously define what this inheritance means. Ethereum's Gasper consensus provides finality after ~2 epochs (~12 minutes), but L2 transactions receive 'soft confirmations' from sequencers within seconds. The security properties of these soft confirmations\u2014and what happens during L1 reorgs\u2014deserve careful analysis. The paper should distinguish between: (1) sequencer confirmations (trust sequencer), (2) L1 inclusion (trust L1 consensus), and (3) L1 finality (cryptoeconomic finality). Each has different security properties.\n\nOn sequencer centralization, the forced inclusion mechanism is mentioned but not analyzed rigorously. The 24-hour timeout in Arbitrum is stated as fact, but what are the actual security guarantees? If an adversary controls both the sequencer and has significant L1 proposer power, can they extend censorship beyond this window? The paper should model the adversarial capabilities required for sustained censorship and quantify the cost. Additionally, the discussion of decentralized sequencer solutions (Espresso, Astria) lacks analysis of their consensus mechanisms' security properties\u2014what are the BFT assumptions, what happens under network partitions, and how do these compare to L1 consensus security?\n\nThe external DA layer analysis is also incomplete. Stating that users 'must trust the DA layer's consensus mechanism' is accurate but insufficient. What are the specific security assumptions of Celestia's consensus? How does EigenDA's restaking model affect DA guarantees? What are the implications of DA layer liveness failures for rollup security? These questions are central to evaluating the security tradeoffs of different DA strategies.",

          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of cryptographic proof systems, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening in several areas. First, the soundness discussion conflates different notions\u2014computational soundness (no PPT adversary can produce accepting proofs for false statements) versus knowledge soundness (the prover must 'know' a witness). For ZK-rollups, knowledge soundness is critical because we need assurance that valid proofs correspond to actual valid state transitions, not merely that invalid proofs are hard to forge. The manuscript should clarify that SNARKs like Groth16 achieve knowledge soundness under the Knowledge of Exponent assumption, which is non-falsifiable and stronger than standard assumptions.\n\nThe treatment of algebraically-structured hash functions (Poseidon, Rescue) correctly notes reduced cryptanalytic scrutiny but fails to quantify the security margins or discuss the Gr\u00f6bner basis attacks and algebraic attacks that have been studied. The claim of '128-bit security' for these functions should reference specific security analyses and note that security parameters are often set conservatively due to uncertainty.\n\nThe prover/verifier tradeoff table is useful but oversimplified. For instance, STARK verification costs depend heavily on the FRI parameters (blowup factor, number of queries), and the stated '1-2M gas' range obscures significant variability. Similarly, 'prover time: seconds-minutes' for STARKs versus 'minutes-hours' for SNARKs doesn't capture that STARK provers have better parallelization properties but worse constant factors for small circuits.\n\nThe multi-prover security analysis claiming multiplicative security composition is mathematically naive\u2014this only holds if proof systems are truly independent, which they rarely are (shared field arithmetic, similar constraint systems, common implementation libraries). A more rigorous analysis would discuss common-mode failures and the actual independence assumptions required.\n\nFinally, the manuscript should address the soundness implications of proof recursion and aggregation more carefully. Recursive SNARKs (used in zkSync's Boojum and Polygon's proof composition) introduce additional cryptographic assumptions and potential soundness degradation through composition. The security of aggregated proofs depends on the accumulation scheme's soundness, which deserves dedicated analysis.",

All three reviewers consistently praised the clear taxonomic structure, practical coverage of real-world implementations, and honest acknowledgment of current trust assumptions in deployed systems. The writing quality and organizational clarity are publication-ready.\n\nHowever, the reviewers unanimously identified a critical gap: the manuscript lacks the technical depth expected for a comprehensive security analysis in this domain.

Reviewer 2 highlights the complete absence of Data Availability Sampling discussion\u2014a foundational concept for understanding DA scaling\u2014and oversimplified treatment of L1-L2 finality inheritance. Reviewer 3 raises concerns about superficial soundness analysis and incomplete cryptographic assumption treatment, noting that claims like '128-bit security' lack the formal rigor to be meaningful. The consistent novelty scores of 5/10 and rigor scores of 5-6/10 across all reviewers indicate that while the survey covers known territory adequately, it does not advance understanding sufficiently for expert readers.\n\nThe manuscript occupies an uncomfortable middle ground: too shallow for security researchers and practitioners who need actionable technical details, yet potentially too specialized for a general blockchain audience.

The treatment of L1 finality inheritance is generally accurate, but the manuscript conflates different notions of finality without sufficient precision; for instance, the claim that L2 state 'inherits cryptoeconomic security' from finalized L1 blocks requires careful qualification about what exactly is inherited (data availability vs. execution correctness vs. ordering). The external DA layer comparison is useful but would benefit from formal security reduction arguments - under what precise assumptions does using Celestia provide equivalent security to Ethereum DA? The 2/3 honest stake assumption for Celestia is stated but not compared rigorously to Ethereum's own BFT assumptions. Additionally, the manuscript should address the composability of security assumptions when rollups use external DA - the security is not simply the minimum of L1 and DA layer security but involves complex interactions. The forced inclusion mechanism analysis is solid but should discuss the economic sustainability of this escape hatch under sustained attack conditions and whether the 24-hour delay is sufficient given potential L1 congestion scenarios more extreme than those modeled.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic proof systems perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational understanding but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive security analysis. The formal security definitions in Section 4.1 are correctly stated, and I appreciate the explicit distinction between soundness and knowledge soundness\u2014this is a common source of confusion that the authors handle well. However, the analysis would benefit from more precise treatment of concrete security. For instance, when discussing STARK soundness, the formula 'error \u2248 max(1/|F|, (1/\u03c1)^q)' is a simplification that ignores the grinding attack mitigation and the proof-of-work component in the FRI protocol. The manuscript should clarify whether this is the proven bound or an approximation.\n\nThe discussion of algebraic hash functions (Poseidon, Rescue) correctly notes the reduced cryptanalytic scrutiny compared to SHA-256/Keccak, but should be more specific about the security margins. Poseidon's security relies on the difficulty of solving high-degree polynomial systems over finite fields, and the conservative parameter choices (wider state widths) provide security margins against potential improvements in Gr\u00f6bner basis algorithms\u2014this could be quantified more precisely.\n\nThe treatment of trusted setups is adequate but misses important nuances. For PLONK's universal setup, the manuscript should discuss the relationship between the maximum circuit size supported and the SRS (Structured Reference String) size, as this has practical implications for which circuits can be proven. Additionally, the updatable property of PLONK setups deserves more attention\u2014specifically, the security model where adversaries may have contributed to the setup and the implications for simulation-extractability.\n\nMost critically, the empty Section 4.5 on proof recursion represents a significant gap. Recursive proof composition is central to modern ZK-rollup architectures (used by zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, and others for proof aggregation), and it introduces subtle security considerations. The manuscript should address: (1) whether the recursion is achieved through cycles of curves (as in Pasta curves) or accumulation schemes (as in Nova/Sangria), (2) the soundness preservation guarantees under recursive composition, and (3) recent vulnerabilities discovered in folding schemes that highlight the complexity of achieving secure recursion. Without this section, the manuscript's coverage of ZK-rollup security is materially incomplete.",

The bridge contracts\u2014which handle deposits, withdrawals, and cross-layer message passing\u2014are mentioned only tangentially despite being the primary interface where user funds are at risk. The manuscript should analyze the canonical bridge architecture: how L1\u2192L2 deposits are verified (typically via Merkle proofs against the L1 state root), how L2\u2192L1 withdrawals are processed (including the withdrawal proof structure and verification logic), and the specific vulnerabilities that arise from message serialization, signature verification, and state proof validation. Historical incidents like the Optimism infinite mint bug (2022, related to SELFDESTRUCT handling in cross-layer messages) or the various bridge exploits affecting non-rollup L2s provide valuable case studies. The withdrawal mechanism deserves particular scrutiny: in optimistic rollups, users must wait for the challenge period AND successfully submit a withdrawal proof that passes on-chain verification. What happens if the withdrawal contract has a bug in proof verification? What are the censorship vectors specific to withdrawal transactions? For ZK rollups, how is the withdrawal proof tied to the validity proof, and what are the failure modes? The upgrade governance section is also critically underdeveloped. Current rollups maintain significant upgrade authority\u2014Arbitrum's Security Council can perform emergency upgrades with a 9/12 multisig, Optimism has similar structures, and zkSync Era maintains upgrade keys. These represent real trust assumptions that users must accept, and the manuscript should analyze: timelock durations, multisig threshold configurations, scope of upgradeable components (can the bridge logic be upgraded? the verifier contract?), and historical upgrade incidents. The emergency pause functionality present in most rollup contracts also deserves analysis\u2014who can pause, under what conditions, and what are the implications for user fund accessibility during a pause?",

The formal definitions in Section 4.1 are correct, and I appreciate the explicit statement of knowledge soundness as distinct from computational soundness - this is indeed the relevant property for rollup state transitions. However, the treatment of concrete security is inconsistent. For Groth16, you correctly note the tight reduction to q-SDH, but for PLONK you mention 'security loss' from Fiat-Shamir without quantifying it (the Attema-Fehr-Kloo\u00df bound gives roughly sqrt(Q) loss for Q queries). The STARK section appears truncated, which is problematic given STARKs' prominence in production systems. A complete analysis should address the FRI soundness error (roughly \u03c1^t for proximity parameter \u03c1 and t queries), the security implications of the conjectured vs. proven proximity gaps, and how production systems like StarkNet balance prover efficiency against soundness error. The fraud proof analysis, while practically oriented, lacks cryptographic formalization. The interactive bisection protocol is essentially an argument system where the verifier (L1 contract) is convinced of computation correctness. This should be analyzed as such, with explicit security definitions and reductions. What are the synchrony assumptions? What happens if the adversary can delay messages? The 'O(log n) rounds' complexity is stated but not connected to security parameters. Additionally, the manuscript should address proof system implementation vulnerabilities. The Zcash Sapling vulnerability (CVE-2019-7167) demonstrated that even well-audited circuits can contain soundness bugs. For rollups processing billions in value, the gap between theoretical soundness and implementation correctness is a critical attack surface deserving dedicated analysis.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain consensus and data availability perspective, this manuscript demonstrates strong technical understanding of the core challenges. The DAS section is particularly well-executed, correctly identifying that the transformation from binary DA to probabilistic guarantees introduces novel attack vectors around selective unavailability and sampling bias. The treatment of the fisherman's dilemma as a public goods problem is apt and the proposed mitigations are reasonable. However, I would push for more quantitative analysis here - what sampling density is actually required for various security levels, and how does this interact with network latency assumptions?\n\nThe blob expiration analysis is a valuable contribution that many analyses overlook. The identification that rollup security degrades to 'trust in archival infrastructure' after 18 days is correct and important. However, the mitigation strategies listed are somewhat hand-wavy - for instance, claiming that 'decentralized storage networks with economic incentives' solve this problem ignores the significant gap between Filecoin's retrieval guarantees and the availability requirements for fraud proof generation.\n\nThe L1-L2 finality relationship section is good but could be more precise. The statement that L2 'inherits' L1 finality needs careful qualification - what exactly is inherited is the ordering finality, but the execution correctness guarantee has different properties depending on the rollup type. For optimistic rollups, even after L1 finality, the execution correctness remains probabilistic until challenge period completion. The manuscript acknowledges this but the finality hierarchy table could be clearer.\n\nThe builder centralization analysis is timely and important. The revised censorship analysis correctly identifies that PBS dynamics create a more concentrated attack surface. However, the analysis should also consider the role of relays in the PBS pipeline - relay censorship (as observed with OFAC-compliant relays) represents another centralization vector that affects fraud proof inclusion guarantees.\n\nOne significant gap is the lack of discussion on proposer timing games and their interaction with rollup security. Proposers can delay block publication to extract additional MEV, and this timing flexibility could be exploited to delay fraud proof inclusion in ways not captured by the current analysis. Similarly, the interaction between L1 consensus instability (e.g., during network partitions or high-latency periods) and rollup security guarantees deserves attention.\n\nThe external DA layer analysis has improved but remains the weakest section from a consensus perspective. The security composition is not merely about which layer to break - it's about the correlation structure of failures. If the same economic actors stake on both Ethereum and Celestia (which is increasingly common with restaking), the independence assumption underlying the 'break either one' security argument weakens. A proper analysis would model the correlation structure of validator sets and derive security bounds accordingly.",

          "Excellent quantitative analysis of challenge period security including gas price attack scenarios, builder centralization dynamics, and economic sustainability calculations that provide concrete, actionable security bounds",
          "Thorough and sophisticated treatment of data availability security covering blob expiration implications, DAS probabilistic guarantees, the fisherman's dilemma, and honest minority assumptions",
          "Correct formal security definitions for validity proofs with appropriate mathematical notation, proper distinction between soundness and knowledge soundness, and meaningful discussion of reduction tightness and AGM limitations"

        "key_weaknesses": [
          "Manuscript is incomplete\u2014cuts off mid-section during STARK soundness analysis, preventing full evaluation of ZK-rollup security mechanisms",
          "Bridge contract vulnerabilities and withdrawal mechanism security receive inadequate treatment despite being the dominant historical attack vector in L2 exploits (Ronin, Optimism $20M bug, etc.)",
          "Fraud proof protocol lacks formal game-based security analysis, and security composition for external DA layers needs rigorous reduction-based formalization rather than informal claims"

        "required_changes": [
          "Complete the STARK soundness analysis section with explicit treatment of FRI proximity gaps, query complexity, concrete security levels (80-bit vs 128-bit tradeoffs), and hash function choice implications",
          "Add dedicated bridge security section covering: cross-layer message verification, withdrawal proof verification vulnerabilities, replay protection mechanisms, and case study analysis of historical bridge exploits with root causes",
          "Formalize the security composition for external DA layers using reduction-based framework with precise adversarial models, and add formal game-based soundness definition for the interactive fraud proof bisection protocol"
        ],
        "recommendation": "The manuscript is close to publication quality but requires targeted completion and expansion. Authors should: (1) immediately complete the truncated STARK section with full soundness analysis; (2) add a dedicated 2-3 page section on bridge and withdrawal security with historical exploit analysis; (3) formalize the security claims for fraud proof protocols and DA layer composition using standard cryptographic reduction frameworks. These additions should be achievable within a focused revision cycle. The core technical contributions are strong\u2014the manuscript needs completion rather than reconceptualization.",
