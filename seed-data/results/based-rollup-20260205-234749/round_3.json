        "Insufficient treatment of censorship resistance properties under realistic conditions - while claiming superior censorship resistance, the analysis doesn't address how builder concentration (top 3 builders produce >90% of blocks) affects this property for based rollups"

        "Complete the Bolt Protocol section and add rigorous analysis of preconfirmation failure modes, including scenarios where multiple preconfirmation providers make conflicting commitments and the resolution mechanisms",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a consensus mechanisms and MEV economics perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid understanding of the technical architecture but requires deeper engagement with the economic incentive structures that will determine based rollup viability. The treatment of L1 proposer-based sequencing correctly identifies the key mechanism, but the liveness analysis should address what happens when the winning builder doesn't support a particular based rollup - users face potential multi-block delays until a supporting builder wins the auction. The preconfirmation section is the strongest contribution, with the mev-commit architecture and collateralization requirements being particularly well-specified. However, the trust assumptions need more rigorous treatment: what happens when a preconfirmation provider's stake is insufficient to cover correlated failures across multiple commitments? The blob space contention analysis is valuable but should be extended to consider strategic behavior - large rollups might intentionally congest blob space to disadvantage smaller competitors. Most critically, the MEV economics section needs substantial expansion. The claim that based rollups 'diminish MEV capture for L2 operators' understates the complexity: MEV doesn't disappear, it redistributes to L1 builders/proposers. This creates a fundamental question about L2 operator business models and whether based rollups can sustain development without MEV revenue. The manuscript should also address cross-domain MEV opportunities unique to based rollups - atomic L1/L2 arbitrage becomes possible, potentially creating new MEV categories that don't exist in centralized sequencer models. Finally, the censorship resistance claims require more nuanced treatment given current builder market concentration.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a rollup architecture and data availability perspective, this manuscript demonstrates strong technical understanding of the core mechanisms but has notable gaps that limit its completeness as a comprehensive research report. The EIP-4844 integration section is particularly well-executed, with the blob fee volatility observations and contention modeling providing valuable practical insights that go beyond theoretical analysis. The state derivation specification in Section 2.5 is implementation-quality, with the conflict resolution protocol and head management details being especially useful for developers. However, several critical architectural concerns remain underexplored. First, the forced inclusion mechanism\u2014whereby users can bypass uncooperative builders/preconfirmers by submitting directly to L1\u2014is mentioned only implicitly through the 'permissionless submission' property but deserves dedicated analysis including latency penalties, cost premiums, and interaction with the derivation pipeline. Second, the proof system compatibility analysis, while improved with the Taiko multi-tier example, doesn't adequately address how ZK proof generation interacts with the permissionless batch submission model\u2014specifically, who generates proofs when anyone can submit batches, and how proof markets might emerge. Third, the blob retention analysis correctly identifies the 18-day window but doesn't explore the implications for long-running fraud proof disputes or the emerging ecosystem of blob archival services. The comparative analysis with traditional rollup architectures would benefit from a formal framework evaluating DA costs, confirmation latencies, and security properties across different sequencing models. Finally, the truncation of Section 3.3.3 and apparent missing sections significantly impact the manuscript's completeness\u2014the preconfirmation mechanisms are central to based rollup viability, and incomplete coverage undermines the report's utility.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a Layer 2 ecosystem perspective, this manuscript makes important contributions to understanding based rollup mechanics but falls short of providing the comparative framework necessary for practitioners and researchers to evaluate based rollups against alternatives. The blob contention analysis in Section 2.3.3 is particularly valuable and represents genuine insight into the scaling constraints that will emerge as multiple based rollups compete for limited blob space. However, the manuscript's treatment of the broader L2 landscape is disappointingly shallow. Section 1.1 lists rollup categories but never returns to systematically compare them with based rollups. A critical missing piece is the composability analysis: based rollups inherit L1 block times for cross-rollup atomic transactions (when both are based), which is actually a potential advantage over heterogeneous sequencer designs where cross-rollup atomicity requires complex bridging. This should be explored. Conversely, the latency disadvantage means that based rollups may struggle to support high-frequency trading applications that have migrated to faster L2s - this tradeoff deserves quantitative treatment. The preconfirmation section is strong but should connect more explicitly to how preconfirmed transactions interact with cross-rollup operations. The throughput analysis is also incomplete: while blob contention is discussed, there's no systematic treatment of the TPS ceiling under various scenarios or comparison with validium-mode alternatives that could offer escape valves during congestion. The manuscript would benefit from a clear positioning of based rollups within the design space: they appear optimal for applications prioritizing censorship resistance and Ethereum alignment over raw performance, but this conclusion should emerge from rigorous comparative analysis rather than assertion.",

    "meta_review": "All three reviewers converge on a consistent assessment (7.2/10 average each), recognizing this manuscript as a technically solid contribution to the based rollups literature with notable strengths in blob space economics, preconfirmation mechanism analysis, and state derivation specifications. The reviewers uniformly praise the concrete numerical modeling of multi-rollup competition scenarios, the comprehensive treatment of KZG commitment verification, and the well-articulated conflict resolution protocols. The technical accuracy is strong across all reviews (8/10), and clarity is consistently rated highly.\n\nHowever, all reviewers identify a critical structural problem: the manuscript is truncated mid-section (specifically in the Bolt Protocol discussion, Section 3.3.3), leaving preconfirmation trust assumption analysis incomplete. This is not a minor editorial issue but a substantive gap that affects the manuscript's completeness. Beyond the truncation, reviewers identify thematic gaps including: (1) underdeveloped MEV economics and redistribution analysis, (2) insufficient treatment of censorship resistance under realistic builder concentration conditions, (3) missing cross-rollup composability discussion, and (4) superficial comparative analysis with alternative L2 solutions. The novelty scores (6/10 across all reviews) suggest the contribution is more synthetic than groundbreaking, though this is appropriate for a comprehensive technical report.\n\nGiven this is the final review round and the core technical content is sound, the manuscript merits acceptance contingent on completing the truncated sections and addressing the most critical analytical gaps. The issues identified are specific and addressable without requiring fundamental restructuring of the work.",

    "recommendation": "The manuscript provides valuable technical depth on based rollup architecture and is close to publication quality. Authors must prioritize: (1) completing all truncated sections\u2014this is non-negotiable, (2) adding the builder centralization analysis to substantiate censorship resistance claims, and (3) strengthening comparative analysis with a structured comparison framework. If empirical data from Taiko deployments is available, including latency/throughput benchmarks would significantly strengthen the contribution. The MEV economics gap can be partially addressed with a focused discussion of value flow implications, even if full quantitative modeling is deferred to future work. Address these issues and the manuscript will be ready for publication.",
