        "Expand Section 4 with quantitative comparisons: include empirical data on TPS achieved, finality times under various network conditions, and cost-per-transaction across based rollups, optimistic rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism), and ZK rollups (zkSync, StarkNet). Consider including validiums like StarkEx for completeness",

        "Develop a more nuanced throughput analysis that considers the interaction between L1 block space constraints, blob data limits, proof generation bottlenecks, and the theoretical vs. practical throughput achievable under based sequencing"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a Layer 2 ecosystem and scaling tradeoffs perspective, this manuscript makes valuable contributions but requires strengthening in several key areas. The treatment of based rollups as a distinct architectural choice is well-motivated, but the comparative analysis falls short of the rigor needed to guide protocol designers and researchers. Specifically, the comparison table in Section 4.2 provides useful high-level distinctions but lacks the quantitative depth necessary for meaningful evaluation. For instance, stating that shared sequencers offer '~1-2 seconds' confirmation versus '~12 seconds' for based rollups obscures important nuances: what are the actual distributions? How do these change under congestion? What are the security assumptions underlying each latency figure?\n\nThe cross-rollup composability discussion is particularly underdeveloped given its importance. The manuscript correctly notes that 'different based rollups may have transactions in the same L1 block but cannot atomically interact,' but fails to explore the implications for DeFi protocols that rely on atomic arbitrage, liquidations, or multi-venue trading. This is a fundamental limitation that affects the practical utility of based rollups for the most economically significant L2 use cases. The claim that 'shared sequencer networks potentially offer superior cross-L2 properties' deserves rigorous analysis rather than a passing mention.\n\nThe throughput analysis also requires refinement. The manuscript focuses heavily on latency (12-second block times) but inadequately addresses throughput constraints. Under based sequencing, L2 throughput is bounded by L1 block space allocation, blob data limits, and the efficiency of batch compression. With EIP-4844 providing approximately 375 KB of blob space per block (target), what is the theoretical maximum TPS for a based rollup? How does this compare to centralized sequencers that can batch more aggressively? These questions have significant implications for scaling tradeoffs that the manuscript should address.\n\nFinally, the discussion of preconfirmations as a latency mitigation is promising but lacks critical analysis of the trust assumptions involved. Preconfirmations from validators introduce new attack vectors (validator collusion, preconfirmation withholding) that partially undermine the censorship resistance benefits of based sequencing. A more rigorous treatment would analyze the security-latency tradeoff curve as preconfirmation mechanisms are introduced.",

        "Add a dedicated section on MEV redistribution dynamics that quantifies the value flow changes, analyzes builder incentives to include L2 batches, discusses the potential for L2-aware block building, and examines how mechanisms like MEV-Share or OFA could be adapted for based rollups",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a consensus mechanisms and MEV economics perspective, this manuscript captures the high-level architecture correctly but misses critical nuances that would be essential for researchers or practitioners evaluating based rollups. The claim that based rollups achieve 'censorship resistance equivalent to the underlying L1' (Section 3.1) requires more careful qualification\u2014while true for eventual inclusion, the practical censorship resistance depends heavily on builder market dynamics. With 80% of blocks built by 3 builders, short-term censorship of L2 transactions is significantly easier than L1 censorship, as builders could simply not include L2 batches without violating any protocol rules. The manuscript mentions this in Section 7.3 but fails to connect it to the earlier censorship resistance claims.\n\nThe MEV analysis is particularly weak given its centrality to the based rollup thesis. The manuscript correctly notes that MEV flows to L1 validators/builders but does not analyze the implications for L2 transaction ordering fairness. Under based sequencing, L2 transactions enter the L1 builder's optimization problem, meaning L2 users are exposed to the same MEV extraction dynamics as L1 users\u2014this is a significant change from centralized sequencers that could implement fair ordering policies. The manuscript should discuss whether this is a feature (alignment with L1) or a bug (worse UX than possible alternatives).\n\nThe preconfirmation treatment is the most significant gap. The manuscript presents preconfirmations as a solution to latency concerns but does not rigorously analyze their trust assumptions. Key questions left unaddressed: What collateral must proposers post? How is slashing enforced for preconfirmation violations? What happens if a proposer commits to conflicting preconfirmations? How do preconfirmations interact with reorgs? The reference to 'production-ready preconfirmation systems expected 2025-2026' is speculative and should be supported by concrete research milestones. Additionally, the manuscript should discuss the relationship between preconfirmations and Ethereum's evolving inclusion list proposals, as these mechanisms interact in complex ways.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a rollup architecture and data availability perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational understanding but falls short of the technical rigor expected for a comprehensive research report. The most significant gap concerns EIP-4844 integration: the report mentions blobs but fails to address critical implementation considerations. Based rollups posting data via blobs must contend with the blob gas market's distinct pricing mechanism, where blob base fees can spike independently of execution gas costs. The 4096-epoch retention window means based rollups must implement robust data availability strategies\u2014either maintaining their own blob archival infrastructure or relying on third-party DA providers for historical reconstruction. The report should discuss how the ~18-day blob availability window interacts with optimistic rollup challenge periods (typically 7 days) and what happens if blob data becomes unavailable before challenges complete.\n\nThe state derivation discussion is particularly thin given its centrality to based rollup operation. Unlike traditional rollups where the sequencer provides a canonical ordering, based rollups derive state entirely from L1 block contents. This requires careful specification of: which L1 transactions constitute valid L2 batches, how deposit transactions from L1 bridge contracts are ordered relative to L2 user transactions, and how the derivation pipeline handles L1 reorgs that may invalidate previously derived L2 state. The OP Stack's derivation specification provides a useful reference model that should be analyzed.\n\nRegarding proof systems, the manuscript correctly identifies that both optimistic and ZK approaches are compatible with based sequencing, but misses important nuances. For ZK-based rollups like Taiko, the proof generation timeline creates interesting dynamics: proofs must attest to state transitions derived from L1 blocks, but those L1 blocks may not yet be finalized when proofs are generated. The multi-prover architecture mentioned deserves deeper analysis of how prover competition interacts with L1 block timing. For optimistic based rollups, the fraud proof system must be carefully designed since there's no centralized sequencer to hold accountable\u2014the report should clarify who can be challenged and what collateral is at stake.\n\nThe simplified Solidity snippet in Section 2.3 contains a conceptual issue: `require(msg.sender == block.coinbase)` would restrict batch submission to the block proposer, but under PBS the proposer and builder are separated, and the actual block construction happens off-chain. This needs clarification regarding how based rollup batch inclusion actually works within the MEV-Boost/PBS pipeline.",

The authors demonstrate solid understanding of the fundamental architectural distinctions and correctly articulate the censorship resistance and liveness guarantees inherited from L1. The writing quality and pedagogical approach make complex concepts accessible to readers with varying technical backgrounds.\n\nHowever, all three reviewers identify significant gaps in technical depth across several critical areas. The preconfirmation mechanism\u2014essential for practical adoption\u2014receives superficial treatment without rigorous analysis of trust assumptions, slashing economics, or proposer lookahead constraints. The data availability section inadequately addresses EIP-4844 blob transaction dynamics, including pricing mechanisms, retention windows, and fallback strategies. MEV supply chain analysis lacks depth regarding builder incentives, cross-domain extraction strategies, and integration with existing MEV-Boost infrastructure. Additionally, the comparative analysis with other L2 solutions remains largely qualitative when quantitative benchmarking would substantially strengthen the contribution.\n\nThe novelty scores (5-6 across reviewers) suggest the manuscript currently reads more as a survey than a research contribution with original insights.
