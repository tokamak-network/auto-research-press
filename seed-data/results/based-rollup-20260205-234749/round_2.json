However, the treatment of cross-rollup composability implications remains underdeveloped, and the latency/throughput tradeoff analysis would benefit from more rigorous empirical grounding and discussion of emerging mitigation strategies.",

        "Excellent quantitative comparison table (Section 4.1) providing concrete TPS, latency, and cost metrics across rollup architectures with appropriate caveats about theoretical vs. observed performance",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The throughput analysis understates the competitive dynamics for blob space - when multiple based rollups compete for the same 384KB target, individual rollup throughput degrades significantly, yet this multi-rollup contention scenario is not modeled",
        "Missing discussion of preconfirmation mechanisms (mentioned in executive summary but not elaborated) which are critical for addressing the latency disadvantage and represent active research/development in the based rollup space",
        "Validium comparison is superficial - the manuscript conflates validiums with ZK rollups in several places and doesn't adequately address the data availability tradeoff spectrum (full DA vs. DAC vs. off-chain)"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated section on preconfirmation protocols (e.g., based preconfirmations via restaking, proposer commitments) as these directly address the latency tradeoff and are essential for practical based rollup adoption",
        "Expand the blob space competition analysis to model scenarios with 5-10 based rollups competing for blob space, including game-theoretic considerations for blob fee bidding strategies",
        "Include discussion of emerging solutions like based sequencing with fallback to shared sequencers, or hybrid models where preconfirmations come from a decentralized network while final ordering is L1-based"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a Layer 2 ecosystem perspective, this manuscript makes valuable contributions to understanding where based rollups fit in the scaling landscape, but several critical gaps remain. The latency-throughput tradeoff is presented somewhat statically, when in reality the ecosystem is rapidly evolving solutions. Based preconfirmations, where L1 proposers or restaked validators provide soft commitments before L1 inclusion, could fundamentally change the latency calculus - this deserves substantial treatment. The cross-rollup composability section correctly identifies limitations but doesn't explore emerging solutions like shared validity proofs, cross-rollup message passing protocols, or how based rollups might integrate with intent-based architectures that abstract away the composability problem at the application layer. The comparison with validiums is particularly weak - StarkEx is mentioned but the broader design space of volitions (user-chosen DA) and the tradeoffs between security and throughput in the DA layer deserve more attention. The manuscript would also benefit from discussing how based rollups interact with the broader modular blockchain thesis - specifically, how they might leverage alternative DA layers (Celestia, EigenDA) while maintaining L1 sequencing, and what security properties this preserves or sacrifices. Finally, the economic sustainability question for based rollups (how do they fund development without MEV capture?) is mentioned but not rigorously analyzed - this is a critical practical consideration that affects which projects can viably adopt this architecture.",

        "Strengthen the builder inclusion incentive analysis by modeling the economic game: under what fee/MEV conditions do builders prefer including L2 batches vs. L1-only transactions? Consider the role of L2 priority fees, blob fee dynamics, and cross-domain MEV opportunities as inclusion incentives"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a consensus mechanisms and MEV economics perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the fundamental architecture but falls short on several critical dimensions. The treatment of L1 proposer-based sequencing correctly identifies the key insight that based rollups delegate ordering authority to L1 proposers via the PBS pipeline, and the censorship resistance analysis appropriately distinguishes between short-term (builder-level) and long-term (validator-level) guarantees. However, the manuscript significantly underdelivers on preconfirmation mechanisms, which are arguably the most important innovation enabling practical based rollup deployment. Without preconfs, the 12-second minimum latency makes based rollups unsuitable for most DeFi applications. The manuscript should analyze protocols like mev-commit that enable proposers to make credible commitments about future block contents, the slashing conditions that enforce these commitments, and the trust assumptions users must make when relying on preconfs versus waiting for L1 inclusion. On MEV economics, while the comparison table correctly notes that MEV flows to L1 validators/builders rather than L2 operators, there's no quantitative analysis of what this means economically. Arbitrum and Optimism currently capture significant MEV revenue that funds development and operations - how do based rollups sustain themselves without this revenue? The manuscript mentions 'diminished MEV capture for L2 operators' but doesn't explore the magnitude or implications. Additionally, the analysis should consider how based rollup adoption affects the MEV supply chain: does it increase total extractable value (via cross-domain MEV opportunities) or merely redistribute existing value? The builder inclusion incentive question deserves more rigorous treatment - the manuscript assumes builders will include L2 batches but doesn't model why this is economically rational given the opportunity cost of blob space and the competitive dynamics of the builder market.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a rollup architecture and data availability perspective, this manuscript represents solid work that correctly identifies the key technical components of based rollups. The treatment of EIP-4844 integration is particularly strong, correctly noting the blob retention window constraints and their implications for fraud proof timing. However, several areas require deeper technical specification. First, the batch submission architecture (Section 2.3.3) shows a simplified contract but doesn't address how builders actually construct valid batches - specifically, the coordination required between the rollup's derivation rules and the builder's batch construction logic. The `verifyBlobData` function is hand-waved when in reality this involves the point evaluation precompile at address 0x0A and requires careful handling of the blob versioned hash verification. Second, the state derivation section, while improved from what appears to be an earlier version, still lacks specification of edge cases: what happens when L1 blocks contain multiple valid batches from different submitters? The manuscript states batch submission is permissionless but doesn't specify the conflict resolution mechanism. Third, the proof system analysis for ZK-based rollups underestimates the complexity of proof generation timing. Current ZK provers (e.g., Taiko's multi-tier proving with SGX fallback) take 10-30 minutes for proof generation, which is well after L1 finality - this actually simplifies the reorg concern but introduces different challenges around proof economics and liveness. The manuscript should clarify that 'eager proving' as described isn't practically implemented by any production system. Finally, the data availability analysis should address the emerging concern of 'blob space as a scarce resource' - with Dencun live, we're already seeing blob fee spikes during high-activity periods, and based rollups have no priority access to blob space unlike rollups with dedicated sequencers that can implement sophisticated blob fee strategies.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript provides a technically solid and well-structured analysis of based rollups, demonstrating strong understanding of L1 sequencing mechanics, EIP-4844 blob economics, and MEV dynamics. All three reviewers converge on similar assessments (7.2-7.6 range), praising the quantitative comparative analysis, clear articulation of the builder centralization problem, and comprehensive treatment of data availability constraints. The manuscript successfully positions based rollups within the broader L2 ecosystem with appropriate technical depth.\n\nHowever, reviewers unanimously identify a critical gap: the treatment of preconfirmation mechanisms is inadequate despite being mentioned in the executive summary as a key topic. This omission is significant because preconfirmations directly address the latency disadvantage that is central to the based rollup tradeoff analysis. Additionally, reviewers note that the MEV economics analysis lacks quantitative depth regarding value flow magnitudes and sustainability implications, and the blob space contention modeling under multi-rollup competition scenarios is underdeveloped. These gaps prevent the manuscript from achieving the comprehensive coverage its scope promises.\n\nThe identified weaknesses are substantive but clearly addressable through targeted additions rather than fundamental restructuring. The core technical analysis is sound, and the requested additions (preconfirmation protocols, quantitative MEV modeling, blob contention analysis) would strengthen rather than contradict the existing content. Given the manuscript's solid foundation and the specific, actionable nature of reviewer feedback, a minor revision is appropriate.",
