Security property P(E) = 'users can always withdraw' requires invariant I(V) = 'verifier correctly validates state'. If U can modify V during escape hatch timelock, then P(E) is violated.

In Scroll's architecture, the zkEVM circuit enforces EVM semantics but treats CHAINLINK_PRICE as an unconstrained public input.

This requires extending verification languages to express and check economic invariants.",
      "evidence": "Runtime Verification's audit of Optimism and formal verification work on zkSync contracts verify Solidity/Yul correctness but don't model oracle manipulation economics. The MakerDAO formal verification effort explicitly models 'collateral price bounds' as assumptions but doesn't compose these with L2 bridge verification. Academic work on 'DeFi Composability' (Babel et al., FC 2023) shows that 97% of DeFi exploits involve economic rather than cryptographic failures. Certora's verification of Aave V3 includes 'economic health' invariants but these don't propagate through L2 bridge interactions.",

      "description": "StarkNet employs a recursive STARK architecture (SHARP - Shared Prover) where multiple transaction batches are proven individually, then these proofs are recursively aggregated into a single proof submitted to L1. The state root at each recursion level depends on the integrity of all child proofs. This creates a hierarchical dependency structure where state commitments at depth N implicitly rely on the soundness of all proofs at depths 0 through N-1. The SHARP system aggregates proofs from multiple StarkNet applications, meaning a flaw in recursion handling could affect state integrity across multiple independent deployments.",
      "evidence": "StarkWare's SHARP documentation indicates that recursive verification uses Cairo-based verifier programs that verify inner STARK proofs. Each recursion step produces a new proof attesting to the validity of multiple child proofs. The state diff commitment in StarkNet's L1 contract (Starknet Core Contract) accepts the final recursive proof alongside the new state root. Production data shows recursion depths of 2-4 levels are typical, with each level aggregating 10-100+ proofs. The Cairo verifier circuit itself becomes part of the statement being proven, creating a self-referential structure where verifier bugs could propagate through recursion layers.",

      "description": "zkSync Era migrated to the Boojum proof system which uses a custom accumulation scheme based on FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs) for recursive composition. Unlike traditional recursive SNARKs using cycle curves, Boojum accumulates FRI commitments across proof instances. The state root verification depends on the accumulated polynomial commitments being correctly maintained across the recursion chain. If accumulation parameters (particularly the FRI folding factor or query count) are misconfigured at any recursion level, the effective soundness can degrade multiplicatively rather than additively.",
      "evidence": "Boojum's architecture documents reveal that the system uses a 'proof compression' pipeline: base-layer proofs (using Goldilocks field) are compressed through multiple stages before final verification. Each compression stage involves accumulating polynomial evaluations. The zkSync Era codebase shows that state diffs are committed alongside accumulated proof data, with the L1 verifier contract checking both the final accumulation and the state transition. A March 2024 security review identified that improper handling of accumulation randomness across recursion boundaries could allow proof malleability, though this was patched before mainnet impact.",

      "description": "The time delta between when transactions are sequenced (and soft-confirmed), when proofs are generated, when proofs are aggregated/recursed, and when the final proof is submitted to L1 creates multiple state inconsistency windows. During these windows, the sequencer has committed to a state that is not yet cryptographically verified on L1. Adversarial conditions (network congestion, prover failures, deliberate delays) can extend these windows from typical durations of 10-30 minutes to potentially hours or days. This creates opportunities for state manipulation if combined with sequencer compromise or economic attacks on the proving infrastructure.",
      "evidence": "Empirical analysis of L1 submission patterns shows: StarkNet averages 2-8 hours between state updates during normal operation, with outliers exceeding 24 hours during network stress. zkSync Era targets ~1 hour proof submission latency but has experienced 6+ hour delays during high-load periods. Polygon zkEVM maintains tighter windows (~30 minutes typical) but uses a trusted aggregator model that introduces different trust assumptions. During the March 2024 Dencun upgrade, multiple ZK-rollups experienced proof pipeline disruptions extending state finality windows significantly. The economic cost to maintain proving infrastructure during extended adversarial conditions is estimated at $10,000-100,000+ per day for major rollups.",

      "description": "Polygon zkEVM and similar systems using cycle curves (curves where each curve's scalar field equals the other's base field, enabling efficient recursive verification) face specific failure modes when recursion depth assumptions are violated. The security analysis of these systems typically assumes bounded recursion depth, with soundness parameters chosen accordingly. If operational conditions force deeper recursion than analyzed (e.g., during proof backlog recovery), the effective security parameter degrades. This degradation may not trigger explicit errors but results in proofs with lower-than-expected soundness guarantees.",
      "evidence": "Polygon zkEVM uses a variant of the Pasta curves (Pallas/Vesta) for recursive composition. Security proofs for these constructions assume recursion depths bounded by parameters set at system initialization. The zkEVM's aggregator circuit has hardcoded maximum recursion depth parameters. During stress testing, scenarios were identified where proof backlogs could theoretically require exceeding these depths. The mitigation involves queuing proofs rather than deepening recursion, but this extends state finality windows. Academic analysis (B\u00fcnz et al., Proof-Carrying Data) shows that for accumulation schemes, soundness error grows as O(d * \u03b5) for depth d and per-step error \u03b5, but implementation-specific factors can cause worse-than-linear growth.",

      "description": "Managing recursive proof pipelines under adversarial network conditions requires maintaining integrity across multiple interdependent components: witness generators, base provers, recursive aggregators, and L1 submission infrastructure. Each component has different failure modes, resource requirements, and attack surfaces. The recursive structure amplifies operational complexity because a failure at any stage can invalidate work done at subsequent stages. Adversaries can exploit this by targeting the most resource-constrained component (typically the recursive aggregation step) to cause cascading failures that extend state inconsistency windows.",
      "evidence": "Incident analysis from zkSync Era's April 2023 mainnet pause revealed that prover infrastructure issues caused a 5+ hour delay in state finalization. The recursive architecture meant that while base proofs continued to be generated, they accumulated without aggregation, creating a recovery challenge. StarkNet's SHARP system distributes proving across multiple parties, but the final aggregation step remains a bottleneck. Resource analysis shows recursive aggregation steps require 10-100x the computational resources of base proving per proof aggregated. Economic attacks targeting prover availability (e.g., competing for the same cloud GPU resources) have been theorized as viable denial-of-service vectors.",

          "description": "Major ZK-rollups exhibit fundamentally different data availability architectures in validium mode. zkSync Era's validium configuration relies on a Data Availability Committee (DAC) with a threshold signature scheme, StarkNet's Volition mode allows per-transaction DA choice between on-chain and off-chain (StarkEx DAC), while Polygon zkEVM's validium uses a permissioned DAC with planned migration to Avail/Celestia. These architectural choices create distinct trust assumptions: DAC-based systems require honest majority among committee members (typically 5-of-8 or similar), while modular DA layers introduce cross-chain finality dependencies.",
          "evidence": "zkSync Era documentation specifies DAC with configurable threshold (default requiring 4-of-6 signatures). StarkEx DAC members include ConsenSys, Chainstack, and Nethermind with 2-of-3 threshold for StarkWare deployments. Polygon's CDK validium initially launched with a 4-of-6 DAC before announcing Avail integration. Each architecture exhibits different failure modes: DAC collusion requires fewer corrupted parties than modular DA light client attacks but has lower capital requirements for adversaries.",

A rational adversary controlling DA committee members can selectively withhold transaction data for specific users or applications while maintaining valid state roots. The protocol remains 'compliant' as long as validity proofs verify\u2014the liveness failure appears indistinguishable from network issues.",

The commitment scheme (typically KZG or Pedersen) proves data was known at proof generation time but provides no guarantee of continued availability. In StarkEx, the Data Availability Committee attestation is a simple multisig on the state diff hash\u2014committee members face no slashing for non-publication beyond reputational damage. This creates a game where withholding data for high-MEV transactions can be profitable if MEV extracted exceeds reputational/future fee costs.",

StarkNet's prover is operated solely by StarkWare. Polygon zkEVM has a single prover with plans for decentralization. Even proposed decentralization thresholds (e.g., Polygon's target of 100+ provers) may be insufficient because: (1) hardware costs create natural oligopolies, (2) proving is embarrassingly parallelizable creating economies of scale, (3) MEV-aware provers can form cartels for profit-sharing. The minimum viable decentralization likely requires 500+ independent provers with geographic/jurisdictional diversity.",
          "evidence": "Current ZK-proof generation costs: zkSync Era batch proof ~$0.03-0.10 (GPU), StarkNet SHARP proof ~$0.50-2.00 per transaction batch. Hardware requirements: zkSync proofs require 128GB+ RAM and high-end GPUs; StarkNet proofs require similar resources. At these costs, profitable proving requires significant capital investment ($50K-500K per competitive prover node). Analysis of Bitcoin/Ethereum mining pool centralization suggests that when top-3 entities control >50% of resource-intensive network functions, coordinated censorship becomes feasible. Current ZK-rollup prover centralization far exceeds this threshold.",

FPGA provers (e.g., Ingonyama, Cysic) offer 10-100x efficiency gains but require $10M+ development investment. ASIC provers under development could offer additional 10x gains with $50-100M development costs. This creates a winner-take-most dynamic where 2-3 hardware providers could control proof generation capacity. Unlike PoW mining where ASICs are commoditized, ZK-proof ASICs are protocol-specific, creating vendor lock-in and single points of failure.",

Historical precedent: Bitcoin ASIC manufacturing consolidated to 3 major manufacturers (Bitmain, MicroBT, Canaan) controlling >90% of hashrate production within 5 years of ASIC introduction. Similar consolidation in ZK-proof hardware would create chokepoints for regulatory capture or adversarial control.",

MEV quantification relies on L1 historical data extrapolated to validium scenarios\u2014actual extractable value may differ due to different user behavior and liquidity profiles on L2s.\n2. Prover decentralization thresholds are estimated based on mining pool centralization analogies; ZK-proving may exhibit different economic dynamics due to non-fungible proof requirements.\n3. Hardware acceleration projections assume continued Moore's Law-adjacent improvements; quantum computing developments could invalidate current SNARK security assumptions entirely.\n\n**Critical Open Questions:**\n1. What is the minimum economically viable punishment mechanism for DAC members engaging in selective withholding? Current systems rely purely on reputation.\n2. Can cryptographic techniques (e.g., verifiable delay functions, timelock puzzles) enforce minimum data publication windows without trusted hardware?\n3. How do cross-rollup MEV opportunities change the game theory when an adversary controls DA for multiple validiums simultaneously?\n\n**Suggestions for Further Investigation:**\n1. Formal game-theoretic modeling of DAC member incentives under various slashing/reward structures\n2. Empirical measurement of actual data retrieval success rates from existing validium deployments\n3. Analysis of regulatory capture risk for concentrated prover/DAC infrastructure across jurisdictions\n4. Investigation of threshold cryptography schemes that could enable trustless DA committees\n5. Study of insurance/derivative markets that could emerge to hedge against data withholding risk\n\n**Connection to Other Hypotheses:**\nThis analysis supports H4 directly but also intersects with H2 (circuit constraints)\u2014the commitment schemes used for DA attestation are themselves specified via circuits that may contain under-specification vulnerabilities. Additionally, the hardware centralization findings have implications for H1 regarding trusted setup security, as the same entities controlling prover hardware may have participated in setup ceremonies."

In several implementations, a compromised admin can replace the verifier with a contract that accepts arbitrary proofs, enabling theft of all locked funds without generating valid ZK proofs.",

Polygon zkEVM's PolygonZkEVMBridge uses a transparent proxy with admin-controlled upgrades. StarkNet's proxy pattern historically allowed StarkWare to upgrade core contracts. L2Beat's risk analysis categorizes most ZK-rollups as having 'Upgradable' status with varying timelock periods (0-30 days). The Loopring protocol experienced concerns when admin keys could modify critical parameters. Concrete example: If verifier contract V1 requires valid SNARK proof \u03c0 for state transition, admin can deploy V2 where verify() always returns true, then upgrade proxy to point to V2.",

The security properties of escape hatches depend critically on the immutability assumptions of the underlying verification logic.",
          "evidence": "StarkEx's forced withdrawal mechanism allows users to exit after a configurable freeze period, but this assumes the verification logic remains intact. zkSync's Priority Queue for forced transactions provides censorship resistance but relies on honest sequencer behavior during the timelock period.

Security property P(E) = 'users can always withdraw' requires invariant I(V) = 'verifier correctly validates state'. If U can modify V during escape hatch timelock, then P(E) is violated. Optimism's fault proof design explicitly addresses this by separating upgrade authority from dispute resolution, but ZK-rollups generally lack this separation.",

      "notes": "Additional observations and considerations:\n\n**Methodological Approach**: This analysis combined static analysis of deployed smart contracts (via Etherscan, Sourcify), review of official documentation and specifications, examination of governance proposals and historical upgrades, and theoretical modeling of adversarial scenarios.\n\n**Key Limitation - Code Availability**: Some ZK-rollup implementations have unverified or partially verified contracts on mainnet, limiting the depth of formal analysis possible. StarkNet contracts in particular use Cairo which requires different analysis tooling.\n\n**Temporal Dynamics**: The security properties of escape hatches are fundamentally temporal - they depend on the relationship between timelock durations, user reaction times, and L1 finality. Formal models must capture these timing relationships.\n\n**Decentralization Trajectory**: Most projects acknowledge current centralization and have published decentralization roadmaps. The analysis reflects current state (Q1 2024) which may evolve. zkSync's governance system and StarkNet's planned decentralization are active areas of development.\n\n**Suggested Further Investigation**:\n1. Develop executable formal models in TLA+ or Alloy to verify escape hatch properties under various adversarial scenarios\n2. Analyze historical upgrade transactions to identify patterns that could indicate preparation for malicious upgrades\n3. Investigate cryptoeconomic mechanisms (slashing, bonds) that could align admin incentives with user protection\n4. Examine the interaction between L1 reorg risk and escape hatch timing assumptions\n5. Study the feasibility of commit-reveal upgrade schemes that prevent front-running of escape hatch invocations\n\n**Connection to Project Hypotheses**: This research directly supports H2 (vulnerabilities from non-cryptographic sources) by demonstrating that admin key trust assumptions represent a larger practical attack surface than cryptographic primitive failures. The escape hatch analysis also relates to H4 regarding game-theoretic attack surfaces, as adversarial admins can exploit timing relationships between upgrades and user responses.\n\n**Practical Recommendation**: Projects should consider implementing 'upgrade canaries' - on-chain commitments to verification key hashes that users can monitor, combined with automated alerting systems that detect upgrade proposals and notify users to invoke escape hatches if necessary."

      "notes": "Additional observations and methodological considerations:\n\n**Methodological Approach**: This research synthesizes formal cryptographic frameworks (UC, Constructive Cryptography) with empirical analysis of production rollup implementations and documented exploit cases. The gap between theoretical security models and deployed systems is substantial and represents the core challenge for composable security frameworks.\n\n**Key Limitation - Rapidly Evolving Landscape**: ZK-rollup architectures are evolving rapidly. zkSync Era, Scroll, and Polygon zkEVM have all modified their external dependency handling multiple times since mainnet launch. Any formal framework must be parameterized to accommodate architectural changes.\n\n**Critical Gap Identified**: No existing formal framework adequately captures the 'economic security parameter' concept where attack cost (in USD or ETH) serves as a security bound alongside computational hardness assumptions. Bridging this gap requires novel formalization techniques.\n\n**Specific Technical Observations**:\n1. Scroll's zkEVM handles oracle data as 'public inputs' to circuits, meaning the ZK proof guarantees correct processing of potentially malicious data\n2. StarkNet's Cairo language allows explicit modeling of external calls but doesn't enforce security properties on external data\n3. zkSync Era's account abstraction creates additional external dependency points through paymaster contracts that aren't covered by standard rollup security analysis\n\n**Recommendations for Framework Development**:\n1. Extend UC framework with 'economic functionality' that captures cost-to-corrupt bounds\n2. Define formal 'trust boundary' specifications for each external dependency class (oracles, bridges, L1 finality)\n3. Develop compositional security theorems that degrade gracefully (weakest-link rather than catastrophic failure)\n4. Create machine-checkable specifications for Certora/Halmos that encode economic invariants\n\n**Suggestions for Further Investigation**:\n1. Empirical measurement of actual L1 reorg rates and their impact on rollup finality assumptions\n2. Game-theoretic analysis of oracle provider incentives when serving ZK-rollup applications\n3. Formal verification case study: Verify a complete oracle-dependent DeFi protocol on a ZK-rollup using extended framework\n4. Analysis of how proof aggregation (SHARP, zkSync's boojum) affects external dependency composition"

          "description": "StarkNet employs a recursive STARK architecture (SHARP - Shared Prover) where multiple transaction batches are proven individually, then these proofs are recursively aggregated into a single proof submitted to L1. The state root at each recursion level depends on the integrity of all child proofs. This creates a hierarchical dependency structure where state commitments at depth N implicitly rely on the soundness of all proofs at depths 0 through N-1. The SHARP system aggregates proofs from multiple StarkNet applications, meaning a flaw in recursion handling could affect state integrity across multiple independent deployments.",
          "evidence": "StarkWare's SHARP documentation indicates that recursive verification uses Cairo-based verifier programs that verify inner STARK proofs. Each recursion step produces a new proof attesting to the validity of multiple child proofs. The state diff commitment in StarkNet's L1 contract (Starknet Core Contract) accepts the final recursive proof alongside the new state root. Production data shows recursion depths of 2-4 levels are typical, with each level aggregating 10-100+ proofs. The Cairo verifier circuit itself becomes part of the statement being proven, creating a self-referential structure where verifier bugs could propagate through recursion layers.",

          "description": "zkSync Era migrated to the Boojum proof system which uses a custom accumulation scheme based on FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs) for recursive composition. Unlike traditional recursive SNARKs using cycle curves, Boojum accumulates FRI commitments across proof instances. The state root verification depends on the accumulated polynomial commitments being correctly maintained across the recursion chain. If accumulation parameters (particularly the FRI folding factor or query count) are misconfigured at any recursion level, the effective soundness can degrade multiplicatively rather than additively.",
          "evidence": "Boojum's architecture documents reveal that the system uses a 'proof compression' pipeline: base-layer proofs (using Goldilocks field) are compressed through multiple stages before final verification. Each compression stage involves accumulating polynomial evaluations. The zkSync Era codebase shows that state diffs are committed alongside accumulated proof data, with the L1 verifier contract checking both the final accumulation and the state transition. A March 2024 security review identified that improper handling of accumulation randomness across recursion boundaries could allow proof malleability, though this was patched before mainnet impact.",

          "description": "The time delta between when transactions are sequenced (and soft-confirmed), when proofs are generated, when proofs are aggregated/recursed, and when the final proof is submitted to L1 creates multiple state inconsistency windows. During these windows, the sequencer has committed to a state that is not yet cryptographically verified on L1. Adversarial conditions (network congestion, prover failures, deliberate delays) can extend these windows from typical durations of 10-30 minutes to potentially hours or days. This creates opportunities for state manipulation if combined with sequencer compromise or economic attacks on the proving infrastructure.",
          "evidence": "Empirical analysis of L1 submission patterns shows: StarkNet averages 2-8 hours between state updates during normal operation, with outliers exceeding 24 hours during network stress. zkSync Era targets ~1 hour proof submission latency but has experienced 6+ hour delays during high-load periods. Polygon zkEVM maintains tighter windows (~30 minutes typical) but uses a trusted aggregator model that introduces different trust assumptions. During the March 2024 Dencun upgrade, multiple ZK-rollups experienced proof pipeline disruptions extending state finality windows significantly. The economic cost to maintain proving infrastructure during extended adversarial conditions is estimated at $10,000-100,000+ per day for major rollups.",

          "description": "Polygon zkEVM and similar systems using cycle curves (curves where each curve's scalar field equals the other's base field, enabling efficient recursive verification) face specific failure modes when recursion depth assumptions are violated. The security analysis of these systems typically assumes bounded recursion depth, with soundness parameters chosen accordingly. If operational conditions force deeper recursion than analyzed (e.g., during proof backlog recovery), the effective security parameter degrades. This degradation may not trigger explicit errors but results in proofs with lower-than-expected soundness guarantees.",
          "evidence": "Polygon zkEVM uses a variant of the Pasta curves (Pallas/Vesta) for recursive composition. Security proofs for these constructions assume recursion depths bounded by parameters set at system initialization. The zkEVM's aggregator circuit has hardcoded maximum recursion depth parameters. During stress testing, scenarios were identified where proof backlogs could theoretically require exceeding these depths. The mitigation involves queuing proofs rather than deepening recursion, but this extends state finality windows. Academic analysis (B\u00fcnz et al., Proof-Carrying Data) shows that for accumulation schemes, soundness error grows as O(d * \u03b5) for depth d and per-step error \u03b5, but implementation-specific factors can cause worse-than-linear growth.",

          "description": "Managing recursive proof pipelines under adversarial network conditions requires maintaining integrity across multiple interdependent components: witness generators, base provers, recursive aggregators, and L1 submission infrastructure. Each component has different failure modes, resource requirements, and attack surfaces. The recursive structure amplifies operational complexity because a failure at any stage can invalidate work done at subsequent stages. Adversaries can exploit this by targeting the most resource-constrained component (typically the recursive aggregation step) to cause cascading failures that extend state inconsistency windows.",
          "evidence": "Incident analysis from zkSync Era's April 2023 mainnet pause revealed that prover infrastructure issues caused a 5+ hour delay in state finalization. The recursive architecture meant that while base proofs continued to be generated, they accumulated without aggregation, creating a recovery challenge. StarkNet's SHARP system distributes proving across multiple parties, but the final aggregation step remains a bottleneck. Resource analysis shows recursive aggregation steps require 10-100x the computational resources of base proving per proof aggregated. Economic attacks targeting prover availability (e.g., competing for the same cloud GPU resources) have been theorized as viable denial-of-service vectors.",

      "notes": "Additional observations and methodological considerations:\n\n**Methodological Approach**: This analysis combined review of academic cryptographic literature on recursive proof systems with examination of production system documentation, source code repositories, and empirical blockchain data. The gap between theoretical security analyses and operational reality is significant and represents a key finding.\n\n**Limitations**: \n1. Production ZK-rollup codebases are complex and rapidly evolving; specific implementation details may change between analysis and publication.\n2. Security incidents and near-misses are often not publicly disclosed in detail, limiting empirical analysis of failure modes.\n3. The relationship between recursion depth and soundness degradation is system-specific and depends on implementation choices not always documented.\n4. Economic attack viability estimates are theoretical and depend on market conditions.\n\n**Key Observations Supporting H3**:\n- The hypothesis that 'proof recursion schemes introduce non-linear soundness degradation' finds partial support in the architectural analysis. While theoretical bounds suggest additive degradation, implementation factors (accumulation randomness handling, field arithmetic precision, verifier circuit bugs) can cause worse-than-expected degradation.\n- The distinction between cryptographic soundness and operational soundness is crucial: even if cryptographic bounds hold, operational failures can create equivalent vulnerabilities.\n\n**Suggestions for Further Investigation**:\n1. Formal verification of recursive verifier circuits in production systems to identify potential soundness gaps.\n2. Economic modeling of attacks on prover infrastructure availability.\n3. Empirical measurement of actual soundness parameters achieved in production versus theoretical bounds.\n4. Analysis of recovery procedures when proof pipelines fail and accumulated backlogs must be processed.\n5. Cross-rollup comparison of state inconsistency window durations under various network conditions.\n\n**Infrastructure-Level vs. Cryptographic Vulnerabilities**: This analysis confirms that significant attack surface exists at the infrastructure level independent of cryptographic primitive security. Sequencer-prover coordination, proof pipeline availability, and L1 submission timing all represent exploitable vectors that do not require breaking the underlying cryptography."
