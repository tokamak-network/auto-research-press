However, it reads more as a practitioner's guide than a research contribution, lacking empirical validation, quantitative analysis, and novel insights that would distinguish it as original research.",

        "Lacks empirical validation - claims about tool effectiveness (e.g., 'Foundry has emerged as a leading testing framework') are not supported by comparative studies, benchmarks, or usage statistics",
        "The methodology section claims analysis of '150 academic papers' and '50 major blockchain projects' but provides no systematic review methodology, selection criteria, or synthesis of findings from this analysis",
        "Missing critical discussion of test oracle problems specific to blockchain - how do we determine expected behavior when specifications are often informal or incomplete?"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add empirical evaluation comparing testing tools on standardized vulnerability benchmarks (e.g., SmartBugs dataset) with detection rates, false positive rates, and performance metrics",
        "Include a systematic literature review methodology with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria, and synthesize findings rather than simply citing papers in references",
        "Expand the formal verification section to address the specification gap problem - discuss techniques for deriving specifications from informal requirements and the verification of specification correctness itself"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a testing research perspective, this manuscript provides a useful survey but falls short of research-grade rigor. The taxonomy is reasonable but not novel - similar classifications exist in prior work (Durieux et al., 2020; Perez & Livshits, 2021) which should be acknowledged and differentiated from. The treatment of formal verification is superficial; while Certora and KEVM are mentioned, there's no discussion of the fundamental limitations of formal methods in this domain - specifically the semantic gap between high-level specifications and low-level bytecode, the challenge of modeling the blockchain environment (gas, storage, external calls), and the undecidability results that limit what can be verified. The section on economic testing is promising but underdeveloped - agent-based modeling code snippets are illustrative but there's no discussion of validation of such models against real market behavior. The claim that 'formal verification represents the gold standard' needs qualification; formal verification proves properties about models, not deployed systems, and the specification itself can be wrong. I would recommend restructuring this as either (a) a systematic literature review with proper methodology, or (b) an empirical study comparing testing approaches on real-world vulnerabilities. The current hybrid approach lacks the depth required for either. Additionally, the discussion of mutation testing, metamorphic testing, and differential testing - all relevant techniques for blockchain - is notably absent.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of blockchain testing methodologies that demonstrates clear practical value through its well-organized taxonomy and useful code examples across multiple testing frameworks. The reviewer acknowledges the work's strengths in covering the full testing stack from protocol-level to application-level concerns, with particularly strong treatment of security testing practices and real-world vulnerability examples.\n\nHowever, the submission suffers from a fundamental tension between its apparent aims and its execution. While the paper claims to analyze 150 academic papers and 50 blockchain projects, it provides no systematic methodology for this analysis\u2014no selection criteria, no synthesis framework, and no quantitative findings. This undermines the work's credibility as a research contribution. Additionally, claims about tool effectiveness remain unsupported by empirical evidence, and the formal verification discussion lacks depth on the critical specification gap problem. As currently written, the manuscript reads more as a practitioner's handbook than a scholarly contribution suitable for a top-tier venue.\n\nThe core content is sound and the topic is timely, but significant revisions are needed to elevate this from a useful guide to a rigorous research contribution. The identified weaknesses are addressable but require substantial additional work rather than minor polish.",

    "recommendation": "The authors should substantially revise this manuscript to strengthen its research contribution. First, either provide a rigorous systematic review methodology for the claimed analysis of 150 papers and 50 projects, or adjust claims to match actual methodology. Second, add empirical validation through comparative tool evaluation on established benchmarks\u2014this would significantly strengthen the work's contribution. Third, deepen the theoretical discussion around test oracles and specification gaps, which are fundamental challenges the current draft glosses over. The practical content is valuable, but a top-tier venue requires demonstrated rigor beyond what a blog post or documentation would provide. Consider whether the contribution is better positioned as an empirical study with novel findings or a systematic literature review with clear methodology\u2014and execute accordingly.",
