        "Complete the truncated sections and add the promised analysis of emerging paradigms (AI-assisted verification) and future projections to fulfill the stated objectives",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a testing expert perspective, this manuscript makes a solid contribution to the blockchain testing literature by providing a well-structured taxonomy and practical guidance. The systematic literature review methodology (Section 1.3) is commendable and follows established guidelines. The treatment of the test oracle problem (Section 3.2) is particularly valuable, as this fundamental challenge is often glossed over in practitioner-focused materials. However, several issues require attention. First, the empirical evaluation, while useful, needs strengthening - the SmartBugs dataset, while standard, contains relatively simple contracts that may not represent the complexity of modern DeFi protocols with cross-contract interactions and flash loan vectors. The detection rates reported should be contextualized with this limitation. Second, the mutation testing section (2.2.3) correctly identifies the gap between coverage and mutation scores but doesn't provide guidance on achieving adequate mutation coverage or discuss computational costs of mutation testing at scale. Third, the differential testing discussion (2.2.5) is excellent but could benefit from discussing the challenge of maintaining test oracles when all implementations might share the same bug (specification bugs). The economic testing section (Section 6) is a highlight, particularly the model validation table showing error rates against historical data - this kind of empirical grounding is rare in the literature. However, the section ends abruptly mid-sentence, which significantly undermines the manuscript's completeness. Finally, while the manuscript acknowledges formal verification limitations, it could more explicitly address the practical reality that most smart contract vulnerabilities in production have been in code that was audited and sometimes formally verified, suggesting the need for defense-in-depth approaches that the manuscript hints at but doesn't fully develop.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of blockchain testing methodologies that demonstrates solid technical depth and practical utility. The reviewer highlights several notable strengths: a systematic methodology with reproducible evaluation criteria, strong practical orientation with implementable code examples, and thoughtful treatment of often-overlooked challenges like the specification gap in formal verification. The coverage of economic testing with agent-based modeling addresses a genuine gap in existing literature, making this a valuable contribution to the field.\n\nHowever, the submission has significant structural and methodological issues that must be addressed before publication. Most critically, the manuscript appears truncated at Section 6.4, leaving the economic testing section incomplete and omitting promised content on AI-assisted verification and future projections. This incompleteness undermines the manuscript's stated objectives. Additionally, the tool evaluation lacks statistical rigor\u2014presenting detection rates without confidence intervals or significance testing limits the reliability of comparative claims. The practical implications of tool limitations (e.g., the 32.8% miss rate for Slither) deserve more thorough discussion to guide practitioners appropriately.\n\nWith one revision round remaining, these issues are addressable but require focused attention. The core contribution is sound, and the manuscript merits publication once completeness and methodological concerns are resolved.",

    "recommendation": "The manuscript makes a valuable contribution to blockchain testing literature but requires completion and methodological strengthening before acceptance. Authors should prioritize: (1) completing all missing sections to fulfill stated objectives, (2) adding statistical rigor to tool evaluations, and (3) providing clearer practical guidance on methodology selection and tool limitations. Given this is round 2 of 3, authors have one final opportunity to address these concerns. A thorough revision addressing all points should position this work for acceptance.",
