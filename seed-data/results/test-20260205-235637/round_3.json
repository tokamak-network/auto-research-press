The manuscript has improved significantly with the addition of statistical rigor, benchmark limitations acknowledgment, and the specification gap discussion, though some sections remain incomplete and certain claims would benefit from additional empirical support.",

        "The tool evaluation relies heavily on SmartBugs benchmark despite acknowledged limitations; the supplementary analysis of 25 real-world exploited contracts is mentioned but results are not presented, weakening claims about tool effectiveness on production systems",
        "Missing coverage of several important testing domains: cross-chain bridge testing (responsible for >$2B in losses), MEV-related testing, and governance attack testing - these represent significant gaps given current threat landscape"

        "Complete Section 6 with the agent-based modeling code example and add substantive coverage of game-theoretic analysis methods, mechanism design testing, and economic simulation validation approaches",
        "Present the results from the 25 real-world exploited contracts analysis, even with appropriate caveats about sample size - this would significantly strengthen the practical applicability claims",
        "Add a dedicated subsection on cross-chain and bridge testing methodologies, as this represents one of the highest-risk areas in current blockchain infrastructure and is conspicuously absent"

      "detailed_feedback": "This revision shows substantial improvement in methodological rigor, particularly in the statistical treatment of tool comparisons and the honest acknowledgment of limitations. The addition of confidence intervals, McNemar's test for significance, and explicit discussion of the SmartBugs benchmark's representativeness issues demonstrates mature scientific thinking. The specification gap discussion in Section 3.4 is particularly valuable - the finding that 80% of exploited formally-verified contracts had vulnerabilities outside verified properties is an important contribution that practitioners need to understand.\n\nHowever, the manuscript suffers from an incomplete Section 6, which is especially problematic given that your own data shows economic vulnerabilities account for the majority of DeFi exploits. The agent-based modeling code cuts off mid-implementation, and there's no discussion of how to validate economic models against historical data, how to parameterize agent strategies, or how to interpret simulation results. This section needs substantial expansion.\n\nThe differential testing discussion appropriately notes the specification oracle problem, but could be strengthened with more examples of how this manifests in practice. The mutation testing coverage is good but would benefit from discussion of equivalent mutant detection strategies and how to prioritize mutants for large codebases.\n\nFor the tool evaluation, while I appreciate the transparency about SmartBugs limitations, the promised supplementary analysis of real-world exploited contracts is mentioned but never delivered. Either present these results or remove the reference. Additionally, the claim that Echidna detected 43% of vulnerabilities missed by static analysis needs more context - what types of vulnerabilities, and how does this translate to practical recommendations for tool selection?\n\nThe manuscript would also benefit from a consolidated decision framework or flowchart that synthesizes the various recommendations scattered throughout into actionable guidance for practitioners with different risk profiles and resource constraints.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of blockchain testing methodologies that has evolved substantially through the review process. The reviewer acknowledges significant improvements in statistical rigor, including the adoption of Wilson score intervals and McNemar's test, as well as thoughtful treatment of the specification gap problem in formal verification\u2014a nuanced issue that many surveys overlook. The systematic methodology with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria and the practical decision framework elements represent genuine contributions to the field.\n\nHowever, several issues prevent immediate acceptance. Most critically, Section 6 on Economic and Game-Theoretic Testing is truncated mid-code, leaving a substantively important section incomplete. This is particularly concerning given the manuscript's own empirical finding that 34% of exploits involved oracle manipulation and 22% involved economic mechanism flaws\u2014the incomplete section directly addresses the testing approaches most relevant to these dominant attack vectors. Additionally, the absence of cross-chain bridge testing coverage represents a significant gap given that bridge exploits have caused over $2 billion in losses. The supplementary analysis of 25 real-world exploited contracts is mentioned but results are not presented, which undermines claims about practical applicability.\n\nDespite these issues, the manuscript demonstrates clear scientific merit and the required changes are well-defined and achievable. The core contributions\u2014the systematic methodology, specification gap analysis, and practical decision frameworks\u2014are sound. Given this is the final review round and the issues are specific and addressable rather than fundamental, a minor revision is appropriate to allow the authors to complete the truncated section and address the coverage gaps.",

    "recommendation": "The manuscript is close to acceptance but requires completion of the truncated Section 6 and addressing the identified coverage gaps. Authors should prioritize: (1) finishing the economic/game-theoretic testing section with the promised code example and substantive methodological content, (2) adding at minimum a discussion of cross-chain testing challenges and emerging approaches, and (3) either presenting the real-world exploit analysis results or removing references to unpresented data. These are bounded, achievable revisions that would bring the manuscript to publication quality. The core contributions are solid\u2014focus the revision on completeness rather than restructuring.",
