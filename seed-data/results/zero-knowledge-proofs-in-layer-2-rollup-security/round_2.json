The manuscript now provides rigorous treatment of knowledge soundness, concrete security bounds, and the cryptographic foundations underlying different proof systems, transforming it from an industry survey into a credible research contribution.",

        "The FRI protocol security analysis, while improved, still lacks precise formalization of the proximity gap and the relationship between query complexity, soundness error, and the blow-up factor\u2014the soundness error formula provided is approximate and could be more rigorously derived",
        "The discussion of simulation extractability (relevant for Groth16 in malicious verifier settings) is absent, which matters for applications where proofs may be reused or composed in adversarial contexts",
        "While Nova is now correctly attributed and better explained, the security analysis of folding schemes remains somewhat superficial\u2014the accumulation of soundness errors and the specific extractability requirements deserve more formal treatment"

      "suggestions": [
        "Add a more rigorous derivation of FRI soundness bounds, referencing Ben-Sasson et al.'s proximity gap analysis and explicitly stating the relationship between rate, field size, and query complexity in achieving target soundness error",
        "Include discussion of simulation extractability and its relevance to rollup security, particularly for scenarios involving proof aggregation or where proofs serve as credentials that may be replayed",
        "Expand the folding schemes section to formally define the accumulation scheme security game and provide concrete bounds on how soundness error accumulates across folding steps, referencing the Nova paper's formal treatment"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "The authors have made commendable progress in addressing my Round 1 concerns. The formal security framework in Section 3 now provides the rigorous foundations I requested, with proper definitions of knowledge soundness and zero-knowledge that correctly distinguish computational from statistical variants. The cryptographic assumptions section (3.2) is particularly well-executed, correctly identifying that KZG relies on q-SDH rather than discrete log, and providing appropriate discussion of the AGM for PLONK-style systems. The trusted setup analysis now includes the formal MPC ceremony description I requested, with clear explanation of the sequential contribution model and the critical 1-of-N honesty assumption. The distinction between soundness breaks and zero-knowledge breaks under setup compromise is correctly articulated.\n\nHowever, some cryptographic details warrant further attention. The FRI soundness analysis provides approximate bounds but doesn't fully capture the proximity gap argument that underlies STARK security. The formula given for soundness error per round is a reasonable approximation but obscures the dependence on the code rate and the number of queries in a way that could mislead readers about parameter selection. Additionally, the manuscript would benefit from discussing simulation extractability\u2014a stronger property than knowledge soundness that Groth16 achieves and that matters when proofs may be used in adversarial composition scenarios.\n\nThe Nova discussion is much improved with correct attribution, but the security treatment remains at a high level. The claim that 'soundness error accumulates additively with folding steps' is correct but deserves formal justification. The relationship between IVC security and traditional SNARK security mentioned in the rebuttal doesn't appear in the revised text. The concrete security bounds for recursive/folding constructions are non-trivial and would strengthen the analysis.\n\nThe citation improvements are substantial\u2014the addition of foundational works (Groth16, PLONK, Bitansky et al., Ben-Sasson et al.) addresses my previous concerns. The references now properly support the technical claims, though I note that some of the concrete security bound claims in the text could benefit from more specific citations to the relevant security proofs in the original papers.",

      "summary": "This revision represents a substantial improvement over the original manuscript, with the authors addressing most of my major concerns regarding sequencer security, bridge vulnerabilities, and data availability analysis. The addition of formal threat models, quantitative MEV analysis, and dedicated bridge security coverage transforms this from a descriptive survey into a more rigorous research contribution, though some areas still warrant deeper treatment.",
      "strengths": [
        "Section 4.2 now provides a formal threat model for sequencer misbehavior with quantitative MEV analysis comparing ZK-rollups to optimistic rollups and L1, along with systematic evaluation of mitigation mechanisms (forced inclusion, encrypted mempools, shared sequencing, based sequencing) with clear trade-off analysis",
        "The new bridge security analysis in Section 4.3 addresses my concerns comprehensively, including security model comparisons between validity-proof and fraud-proof bridges, historical exploit case studies (Ronin, Wormhole, Nomad) with lessons for ZK bridge design, and analysis of withdrawal delay attacks",
        "Data availability analysis has been substantially strengthened with formal security definitions, economic attack cost analysis for different DA mechanisms (on-chain, DAC, decentralized DA layers), and concrete reconstruction guarantees under adversarial conditions"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "The evaluation of shared sequencing networks (Espresso, Astria) remains somewhat superficial\u2014while mentioned in the mitigation table, there is no detailed analysis of their specific security models, consensus mechanisms, or how they handle cross-rollup MEV atomicity, which is a key differentiator",
        "The treatment of based sequencing could be expanded to address the nuanced trade-offs: while the manuscript notes MEV flows to L1 validators, it doesn't analyze the implications of L1 reorg risk on rollup security or the latency implications of waiting for L1 inclusion",
        "The bridge security section, while much improved, lacks quantitative analysis of withdrawal delay attack economics\u2014specifically, the cost-benefit calculus for liquidity providers offering fast withdrawals and how this creates systemic risks during high-volatility periods"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated subsection analyzing shared sequencing architectures in detail, covering their consensus mechanisms (e.g., Espresso's HotShot), economic security models, and how they address cross-rollup MEV extraction while maintaining rollup sovereignty",
        "Expand the based sequencing discussion to include analysis of L1 reorg implications for rollup state, the trade-offs between proposer-builder separation on L1 and rollup sequencing, and concrete latency measurements from existing implementations or simulations",
        "Include quantitative modeling of fast withdrawal liquidity provider economics, including capital requirements, risk premiums during volatility, and potential cascade effects if major LPs exit during market stress\u2014this would strengthen the bridge security analysis significantly"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "The authors have made commendable progress in addressing my Round 1 concerns. The sequencer security section now provides the formal threat model I requested, with clear adversarial capability definitions and a useful comparative table of mitigation mechanisms. The quantitative MEV estimates, while necessarily approximate, provide valuable context for understanding the economic stakes involved. I particularly appreciate the inclusion of forced inclusion latency analysis (12-24 hours) and the honest acknowledgment that current ZK-rollup MEV is lower due to volume rather than architectural advantages.\n\nThe bridge security section is now substantive and addresses a critical gap in the original manuscript. The case studies of Ronin, Wormhole, and Nomad exploits with explicit lessons for ZK bridge design demonstrate good engagement with real-world security failures. The comparison table between ZK and optimistic bridge security models is clear and useful.\n\nThe data availability analysis has been transformed from taxonomic description to rigorous security analysis. The formal definition of data availability, the economic attack cost calculations for DACs (e.g., the 7-of-10 DAC example with $4M attack cost), and the DAS detection probability formula all add the quantitative rigor I requested.\n\nHowever, some gaps remain. The shared sequencing discussion, while present, doesn't go deep enough into the specific security models of systems like Espresso. How does their HotShot consensus achieve finality? What are the liveness assumptions? How do they handle the case where a rollup wants to exit the shared sequencing network? Similarly, based sequencing deserves more nuanced treatment\u2014the interaction between L1 MEV-Boost and rollup sequencing creates complex dynamics that aren't fully explored.\n\nThe decentralization roadmap table in Section 7.4 is useful but optimistic\u2014the 2024-2025 timeline for shared/based sequencing adoption may be aggressive given current testnet status. A more critical assessment of implementation challenges would strengthen this section.\n\nOverall, this revision successfully addresses my primary concerns and elevates the manuscript to a level appropriate for a research contribution. The remaining suggestions are refinements rather than fundamental gaps.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript has demonstrated substantial improvement across the revision cycle, moving from a score of 6.0 to 7.5\u2014a meaningful trajectory that reflects genuine engagement with reviewer feedback. The authors have transformed what was initially characterized as an 'industry survey' into a credible research contribution by adding formal security definitions, rigorous cryptographic treatment, quantitative MEV analysis, and comprehensive bridge security coverage. Both reviewers acknowledge this transformation explicitly, with Reviewer 1 noting the manuscript now provides 'rigorous treatment of knowledge soundness, concrete security bounds, and cryptographic foundations' and Reviewer 2 recognizing it has become 'a more rigorous research contribution.'\n\nExamining the remaining weaknesses, I find them to be refinements rather than fundamental flaws. Reviewer 1's concerns about FRI soundness derivation precision and simulation extractability are valid technical points, but they represent depth enhancements to an already solid treatment\u2014not gaps that undermine the paper's core contribution. Similarly, Reviewer 2's requests for deeper shared sequencing analysis and withdrawal delay economics modeling would strengthen the work but are not essential for publication. Notably, both reviewers score the paper at 7+ across all dimensions, with clarity and accuracy particularly strong. The novelty scores of 6/10 are appropriate for a systematization-of-knowledge style contribution, and reviewers appear calibrated to this\u2014they're not unfairly demanding breakthrough theoretical contributions.\n\nGiven this is the final round, the strong improvement trajectory, the substantive nature of the contribution to practitioners and researchers working on ZK-rollup systems, and the fact that remaining concerns are enhancements rather than corrections, I am exercising editorial judgment to accept this manuscript. The paper provides valuable, reliable analysis of an important and rapidly evolving area of blockchain infrastructure. Continuing to iterate on increasingly marginal improvements would yield diminishing returns.",
