The Arbitrum Security Council, for instance, operates under a constitutional framework with elected members and defined emergency powers, while Optimism's structure involves the Foundation more directly. These differences have material implications for trust assumptions that users should understand. The report also overlooks the political economy of council membership\u2014who serves, why they serve, what incentives they face, and how they coordinate. The 9/12 threshold for Arbitrum emergency actions, for example, requires understanding whether those 9 members could realistically be coerced or coordinated against user interests. Additionally, the governance minimization path described (extended timelocks \u2192 constrained upgrades \u2192 immutability) is presented as a linear progression, but the reality involves complex tradeoffs between adaptability and security that different communities may resolve differently. The report would benefit from examining case studies of actual governance decisions\u2014such as Arbitrum's AIP-1 controversy or Optimism's retroactive public goods funding\u2014to illustrate how governance actually functions in practice. Finally, the timeline projections for Stage 2 achievement (late 2025) seem optimistic given that governance minimization requires not just technical readiness but community consensus that the code is sufficiently battle-tested to warrant reduced upgrade capabilities.",

The claim that 'generating validity proofs remains computationally expensive' is stated without proper context - the report fails to distinguish between different proof systems' asymptotic complexities or explain why certain operations are expensive (e.g., FFTs for polynomial evaluation, MSMs for commitment schemes). The mention of 'PLONK-based proof system' for zkSync Era without discussing the specific variant (vanilla PLONK, TurboPlonk, UltraPlonk with lookup arguments) or the Boojum prover's architectural innovations is insufficient. The section on 'New Proof Systems' mentions Jolt, Binius, and Circle STARKs but provides no technical substance - Jolt's use of sum-check protocols and Lasso lookup arguments, Binius's binary tower field construction, and Circle STARKs' use of the circle group over Mersenne primes are all significant innovations that deserve proper treatment. The proof aggregation discussion is particularly weak given its centrality to rollup economics - there's no mention of how recursive SNARKs work, the overhead of non-native field arithmetic, or the tradeoffs between different aggregation strategies. The report also completely omits discussion of the verifier circuit complexity, which is crucial for understanding L1 gas costs. Finally, the security analysis lacks any discussion of soundness guarantees, the knowledge assumption, or potential vulnerabilities in specific implementations (e.g., the trusted setup ceremony risks for KZG-based systems, or the hash function security requirements for STARKs).",

          "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of blockchain scalability and Layer 2 architecture, this manuscript serves as a competent survey but falls short of research-grade rigor in several key areas within my review scope. The data availability discussion in Section 4.4 is particularly underdeveloped\u2014while the manuscript correctly identifies that alternative DA layers create 'validiums rather than true rollups,' it fails to formalize what this means for security. The security model differences between DAS-based systems (Celestia, Avail) and restaking-based systems (EigenDA) are substantial and affect how we should evaluate rollup maturity. For instance, EigenDA inherits Ethereum's economic security through restaking but introduces slashing correlation risks, while Celestia provides independent security but with a smaller validator set. Neither is equivalent to native Ethereum DA, and the manuscript should quantify these tradeoffs rather than treating all alternative DA as equivalent.\n\nThe sequencer centralization analysis, while identifying the right problems, lacks engagement with the substantial academic and industry literature on this topic. The manuscript mentions based sequencing and shared sequencing but doesn't analyze the fundamental tradeoffs: based sequencing sacrifices L2 sovereignty and introduces cross-domain MEV complications that the manuscript only mentions in passing. What are the actual latency implications? How does proposer-builder separation on L1 interact with based rollup sequencing? The Espresso/Astria shared sequencing discussion would benefit from analysis of their consensus mechanisms and how they achieve finality guarantees that rollups can rely upon.\n\nMost critically, the manuscript entirely omits cross-rollup interoperability analysis despite this being a fundamental bottleneck for the rollup-centric roadmap. Users currently face fragmented liquidity and complex bridging with varying trust assumptions. The security of canonical bridges (which often have the same upgrade mechanisms as the rollup itself), the emergence of intent-based bridging systems, and the challenges of building trustless light client bridges all deserve substantial treatment. How do bridge security assumptions interact with rollup stage classifications? Can a Stage 2 rollup be considered truly trustless if its primary bridge to other rollups requires trusted intermediaries? These questions are central to evaluating the practical security of the rollup ecosystem but remain unaddressed.",

The average score of 6.2/10 reflects solid foundational work undermined by superficial treatment of critical technical domains. Reviewer 2's concerns about ZK proof system analysis are particularly substantive\u2014the absence of rigorous comparisons between proof systems (PLONK, Groth16, STARKs), missing discussion of recursive proof techniques and folding schemes, and lack of cryptographic security assumption analysis represent significant gaps for a manuscript claiming to analyze ZK-rollup maturity. Similarly, Reviewers 1 and 3 identify that governance and architectural analyses remain at a descriptive rather than analytical level.\n\nThe manuscript's strengths are notable: clear presentation of the three-stage framework, comprehensive ecosystem coverage with useful comparative tables, and practical stakeholder guidance. However, all three reviewers independently flag that the work reads more as an industry report than a research contribution, with novelty scores of 4-5/10 across the board. The missing cross-rollup interoperability analysis (Reviewer 3), superficial Security Council governance examination (Reviewer 1), and inadequate data availability security modeling collectively indicate that substantial revision is needed.

The discussion of governance attack vectors is appropriately comprehensive, but the mitigation strategies listed are somewhat superficial\u2014for instance, 'geographic distribution' as a mitigation for regulatory coercion requires analysis of which jurisdictions council members actually reside in and whether current distributions are adequate. The Arbitrum AIP-1 case study is relevant but dated; more recent governance decisions (such as Arbitrum's LTIPP program, Optimism's RetroPGF rounds, or the various Security Council elections) would provide better insight into current governance dynamics. The manuscript correctly identifies that Stage 2 requires governance minimization but doesn't adequately explore the political economy of this transition\u2014rollup teams and their investors have strong incentives to maintain upgrade capabilities, and the path to immutability requires overcoming these interests. Additionally, the relationship between rollup governance and the broader Ethereum governance ecosystem deserves attention, particularly as EIP-4844 parameters and future danksharding decisions will significantly impact rollup economics and thus governance incentives. The treatment of DAOs and token-based governance is notably absent despite ARB and OP being major governance tokens. Finally, the manuscript should address the emerging phenomenon of 'governance extractable value' where council members or large token holders might extract value through governance decisions short of outright theft.",

The DA section correctly identifies the security degradation when moving from Ethereum blobs to alternative layers, but the treatment of DAS security is superficial. The manuscript states that light clients 'sample random chunks' with 'statistical guarantee of availability' without quantifying what this means under adversarial conditions. Specifically, DAS security depends on: (1) the erasure coding rate, (2) the number of independent samplers, (3) the sampling strategy, and (4) assumptions about network-level adversaries who might selectively censor sampling requests. The Celestia and Avail security models differ in important ways (KZG vs. Merkle proofs for chunk verification) that affect both security and performance. Additionally, the manuscript should address the 'fisherman's dilemma' in DAS - who is incentivized to actually perform sampling and report unavailability? On sequencer decentralization, the manuscript presents various approaches (leader rotation, based sequencing, shared sequencing) without critically examining why none have been deployed at scale despite years of development. The economic reality is that centralized sequencers are highly profitable (Arbitrum's sequencer generated >$50M in 2023), creating strong incentives against decentralization. The manuscript should analyze the principal-agent problem: rollup teams benefit from sequencer revenue while users bear centralization risks. For cross-rollup bridging, the truncated section misses critical recent developments. The emergence of intent-based bridging (Across, UniswapX) represents a paradigm shift from message-passing to solver-based fulfillment, with fundamentally different security properties. The manuscript should analyze how intent systems can provide faster finality than native bridges while introducing new trust assumptions around solver behavior and settlement mechanisms. Finally, the interaction between DA choices and bridge security deserves more attention - a validium using Celestia DA connected via a trusted bridge to Ethereum has compounded trust assumptions that significantly degrade the effective security below what either component provides individually.",

The security assumption table correctly identifies the Knowledge of Exponent assumption as 'Medium' confidence, but should elaborate that this assumption is non-falsifiable and represents a genuine concern for Groth16's long-term security.\n\nFinally, the prover decentralization discussion would benefit from concrete analysis of the cryptographic requirements: How do you verify that a delegated prover computed correctly without re-doing the work? What role do commitment schemes play in prover accountability? These questions are central to the 'decentralized prover market' vision but are not addressed.",

The proof system comparison table, while useful, conflates different metrics inappropriately - proving throughput depends critically on circuit size and structure, not just the proof system. For instance, a Groth16 proof for a simple hash preimage takes milliseconds, while a zkEVM execution proof takes minutes to hours. The manuscript correctly identifies recursive proofs and folding schemes as important advances but doesn't explain why they matter cryptographically: folding schemes achieve incrementally verifiable computation (IVC) with O(1) verifier work per step rather than O(n) for naive recursion, fundamentally changing the economics of proof generation. The discussion of prover decentralization mentions commitment schemes but doesn't address the actual cryptographic protocols being developed - for example, how does a proof market verify that a prover correctly generated a proof without the verifier re-running the prover? This requires careful protocol design around witness commitments and accountability. The manuscript also omits discussion of proof composition security - when you wrap a STARK in a SNARK (as Polygon does), you inherit the security assumptions of both systems, and the composition itself must be proven secure. Finally, the treatment of trusted setups could be strengthened: universal setups like KZG ceremonies have specific security requirements (sufficient entropy from at least one honest participant) that differ qualitatively from circuit-specific setups, and the practical implications of setup compromise (ability to forge proofs undetectably) deserve more attention given the billions of dollars at stake.",

However, the complete absence of data availability analysis is a critical oversight. The security model of a rollup fundamentally depends on whether data is posted to Ethereum (rollup) or kept off-chain (validium), and EIP-4844's introduction of blob space creates a new middle ground that deserves careful analysis. How do blob expiration windows (currently ~18 days) affect the security assumptions? What happens to historical data availability? How do rollups handle the transition from calldata to blobs? These questions are central to understanding rollup security models. Similarly, the lack of cross-rollup interoperability analysis is problematic given that users increasingly operate across multiple L2s. The security of the rollup ecosystem is only as strong as its weakest bridge, and the proliferation of bridge designs with varying trust assumptions creates systemic risks that warrant detailed examination. The sequencer decentralization section is strong, but would benefit from more technical detail on specific proposals\u2014for instance, Espresso's HotShot consensus mechanism and its finality guarantees, or Astria's approach to sequencer set management.

          "detailed_feedback": "From a governance and ecosystem development perspective, this manuscript makes valuable contributions to understanding the institutional structures constraining rollup decentralization. The comparative Security Council analysis in Section 4.3.2 is particularly strong, providing the kind of detailed institutional comparison that enables meaningful assessment of governance risks across rollups. The recognition that Arbitrum's elected council with constitutional constraints represents a meaningfully different governance model than zkSync Era's company-controlled multisig is important and often overlooked in technical analyses that treat all 'Security Councils' as equivalent.\n\nHowever, several governance-critical gaps require attention. First, the relationship between upgrade timelocks and stage progression deserves dedicated analysis. Stage 2 requires 30+ day timelocks specifically because this duration allows users to observe a malicious upgrade proposal and exit before it takes effect - this is the fundamental mechanism by which Stage 2 eliminates trust in governance. The manuscript should explain this mechanism clearly and analyze how current timelock durations (and the governance changes required to extend them) represent concrete barriers to Stage 2.\n\nSecond, the governance attack vectors section (4.3.4) is truncated precisely where it becomes most relevant. Regulatory pressure on identifiable council members is arguably the most significant governance risk for rollups with billions in TVL - jurisdictions could compel council members to approve censorship or asset freezing. The manuscript should complete this analysis and consider how geographic distribution of council members (mentioned for Arbitrum) mitigates or fails to mitigate this risk.\n\nThird, the analysis would benefit from examining actual governance events. How did Arbitrum's governance respond to the Foundation's controversial 750M ARB allocation? What does Optimism's handling of the Wintermute token incident reveal about governance accountability? These cases provide empirical grounding for theoretical governance analysis.\n\nFinally, consider adding discussion of governance minimization as a deliberate strategy. Some projects (like Liquity) have achieved immutability by design. What lessons do immutable protocols offer for rollups seeking to reduce governance surface area? What intermediate steps (progressively longer timelocks, narrower council powers, sunset clauses) could rollups adopt to credibly commit to governance minimization?",

Reviewer 2 correctly identifies that EIP-4844 receives only passing mention despite being fundamental to rollup economics and security models, while bridging mechanisms are entirely absent. The ZK proof systems analysis, while competent, lacks the rigor expected of a research contribution: proving throughput figures lack hardware/circuit context, proof system security incidents are not discussed, and critical implementation details (lookup arguments, aggregation pipeline failure modes) are missing.\n\nGiven this is the final round, I have carefully weighed whether these issues could be overlooked.
