      "summary": "This report provides a solid foundational overview of rollup stages and the current ecosystem landscape, with clear explanations of the L2Beat framework and major bottlenecks. However, the governance analysis lacks depth regarding the political economy of Security Councils, and several claims about stage classifications and timelines require more rigorous substantiation.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The Security Council analysis is superficial\u2014it fails to examine the actual governance dynamics, member selection processes, accountability mechanisms, or historical decision-making patterns that determine real-world security outcomes",
        "The claim that 'no major rollup has achieved Stage 2 status' and that Arbitrum is at Stage 1 needs verification against current L2Beat data, as stage classifications have been contested and evolve; the report should acknowledge classification disputes",
        "Missing critical analysis of governance capture risks, including regulatory pressure on identifiable council members, coordination among council members, and the lack of formal accountability frameworks for council decisions"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Expand the Security Council section to include: member selection criteria, geographic/jurisdictional distribution, conflict of interest policies, historical upgrade decisions, and comparison of different council structures (Arbitrum's elected model vs. Optimism's appointed model)",
        "Add a dedicated section on governance attack vectors including: social engineering of council members, regulatory coercion scenarios, economic incentives for malicious upgrades, and analysis of what 'emergency' thresholds have been used historically",
        "Include discussion of emerging governance innovations beyond timelocks\u2014such as Arbitrum's constitutional framework, Optimism's bicameral governance model with the Citizens' House, and proposals for on-chain governance constraints that could enable faster upgrades with formal guarantees"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain governance perspective, this report correctly identifies Security Councils as a critical bottleneck but treats them as a monolithic concept rather than examining the significant variation in their design and operation. The Arbitrum Security Council, for instance, operates under a constitutional framework with elected members and defined emergency powers, while Optimism's structure involves the Foundation more directly. These differences have material implications for trust assumptions that users should understand. The report also overlooks the political economy of council membership\u2014who serves, why they serve, what incentives they face, and how they coordinate. The 9/12 threshold for Arbitrum emergency actions, for example, requires understanding whether those 9 members could realistically be coerced or coordinated against user interests. Additionally, the governance minimization path described (extended timelocks \u2192 constrained upgrades \u2192 immutability) is presented as a linear progression, but the reality involves complex tradeoffs between adaptability and security that different communities may resolve differently. The report would benefit from examining case studies of actual governance decisions\u2014such as Arbitrum's AIP-1 controversy or Optimism's retroactive public goods funding\u2014to illustrate how governance actually functions in practice. Finally, the timeline projections for Stage 2 achievement (late 2025) seem optimistic given that governance minimization requires not just technical readiness but community consensus that the code is sufficiently battle-tested to warrant reduced upgrade capabilities.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Grossly oversimplified ZK proof system comparisons - the table showing 'proving time' and 'hardware cost' lacks methodology, doesn't distinguish between SNARK/STARK tradeoffs, and ignores critical metrics like proof size, verification time, and trusted setup requirements",

      "suggestions": [
        "Add a dedicated section comparing PLONK, Groth16, STARKs, and newer systems (Halo2, Plonky2/3) with rigorous metrics: proof size, prover time complexity, verifier time complexity, trusted setup requirements, and post-quantum security considerations",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a ZK proof systems perspective, this manuscript requires substantial revision. The claim that 'generating validity proofs remains computationally expensive' is stated without proper context - the report fails to distinguish between different proof systems' asymptotic complexities or explain why certain operations are expensive (e.g., FFTs for polynomial evaluation, MSMs for commitment schemes). The mention of 'PLONK-based proof system' for zkSync Era without discussing the specific variant (vanilla PLONK, TurboPlonk, UltraPlonk with lookup arguments) or the Boojum prover's architectural innovations is insufficient. The section on 'New Proof Systems' mentions Jolt, Binius, and Circle STARKs but provides no technical substance - Jolt's use of sum-check protocols and Lasso lookup arguments, Binius's binary tower field construction, and Circle STARKs' use of the circle group over Mersenne primes are all significant innovations that deserve proper treatment. The proof aggregation discussion is particularly weak given its centrality to rollup economics - there's no mention of how recursive SNARKs work, the overhead of non-native field arithmetic, or the tradeoffs between different aggregation strategies. The report also completely omits discussion of the verifier circuit complexity, which is crucial for understanding L1 gas costs. Finally, the security analysis lacks any discussion of soundness guarantees, the knowledge assumption, or potential vulnerabilities in specific implementations (e.g., the trusted setup ceremony risks for KZG-based systems, or the hash function security requirements for STARKs).",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of blockchain scalability and Layer 2 architecture, this manuscript serves as a competent survey but falls short of research-grade rigor in several key areas within my review scope. The data availability discussion in Section 4.4 is particularly underdeveloped\u2014while the manuscript correctly identifies that alternative DA layers create 'validiums rather than true rollups,' it fails to formalize what this means for security. The security model differences between DAS-based systems (Celestia, Avail) and restaking-based systems (EigenDA) are substantial and affect how we should evaluate rollup maturity. For instance, EigenDA inherits Ethereum's economic security through restaking but introduces slashing correlation risks, while Celestia provides independent security but with a smaller validator set. Neither is equivalent to native Ethereum DA, and the manuscript should quantify these tradeoffs rather than treating all alternative DA as equivalent.\n\nThe sequencer centralization analysis, while identifying the right problems, lacks engagement with the substantial academic and industry literature on this topic. The manuscript mentions based sequencing and shared sequencing but doesn't analyze the fundamental tradeoffs: based sequencing sacrifices L2 sovereignty and introduces cross-domain MEV complications that the manuscript only mentions in passing. What are the actual latency implications? How does proposer-builder separation on L1 interact with based rollup sequencing? The Espresso/Astria shared sequencing discussion would benefit from analysis of their consensus mechanisms and how they achieve finality guarantees that rollups can rely upon.\n\nMost critically, the manuscript entirely omits cross-rollup interoperability analysis despite this being a fundamental bottleneck for the rollup-centric roadmap. Users currently face fragmented liquidity and complex bridging with varying trust assumptions. The security of canonical bridges (which often have the same upgrade mechanisms as the rollup itself), the emergence of intent-based bridging systems, and the challenges of building trustless light client bridges all deserve substantial treatment. How do bridge security assumptions interact with rollup stage classifications? Can a Stage 2 rollup be considered truly trustless if its primary bridge to other rollups requires trusted intermediaries? These questions are central to evaluating the practical security of the rollup ecosystem but remain unaddressed.",

    "meta_review": "The three reviewers converge on a consistent assessment: this manuscript provides a well-structured, accessible overview of the rollup maturity framework and current ecosystem landscape, but lacks the technical depth expected for a rigorous academic contribution. The average score of 6.2/10 reflects solid foundational work undermined by superficial treatment of critical technical domains. Reviewer 2's concerns about ZK proof system analysis are particularly substantive\u2014the absence of rigorous comparisons between proof systems (PLONK, Groth16, STARKs), missing discussion of recursive proof techniques and folding schemes, and lack of cryptographic security assumption analysis represent significant gaps for a manuscript claiming to analyze ZK-rollup maturity. Similarly, Reviewers 1 and 3 identify that governance and architectural analyses remain at a descriptive rather than analytical level.\n\nThe manuscript's strengths are notable: clear presentation of the three-stage framework, comprehensive ecosystem coverage with useful comparative tables, and practical stakeholder guidance. However, all three reviewers independently flag that the work reads more as an industry report than a research contribution, with novelty scores of 4-5/10 across the board. The missing cross-rollup interoperability analysis (Reviewer 3), superficial Security Council governance examination (Reviewer 1), and inadequate data availability security modeling collectively indicate that substantial revision is needed. These are not minor presentation issues but fundamental gaps in analytical depth that must be addressed for the manuscript to meet publication standards.",

    "recommendation": "This manuscript has a solid foundation but requires substantial deepening of technical analysis to meet publication standards.

The current work reads as a well-written industry report rather than a research contribution\u2014the revision should demonstrate analytical novelty beyond synthesizing publicly available information. Consider engaging with recent academic literature on the specific technical topics flagged by reviewers.",
