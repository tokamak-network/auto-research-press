      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a ZK proof systems perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding but falls short of the rigor expected for a research contribution. The proof system comparison table, while useful, conflates different metrics inappropriately - proving throughput depends critically on circuit size and structure, not just the proof system. For instance, a Groth16 proof for a simple hash preimage takes milliseconds, while a zkEVM execution proof takes minutes to hours. The manuscript correctly identifies recursive proofs and folding schemes as important advances but doesn't explain why they matter cryptographically: folding schemes achieve incrementally verifiable computation (IVC) with O(1) verifier work per step rather than O(n) for naive recursion, fundamentally changing the economics of proof generation. The discussion of prover decentralization mentions commitment schemes but doesn't address the actual cryptographic protocols being developed - for example, how does a proof market verify that a prover correctly generated a proof without the verifier re-running the prover? This requires careful protocol design around witness commitments and accountability. The manuscript also omits discussion of proof composition security - when you wrap a STARK in a SNARK (as Polygon does), you inherit the security assumptions of both systems, and the composition itself must be proven secure. Finally, the treatment of trusted setups could be strengthened: universal setups like KZG ceremonies have specific security requirements (sufficient entropy from at least one honest participant) that differ qualitatively from circuit-specific setups, and the practical implications of setup compromise (ability to forge proofs undetectably) deserve more attention given the billions of dollars at stake.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain scalability and Layer 2 architecture perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid understanding of the rollup landscape but has significant gaps in coverage that limit its utility as a comprehensive research document. The proof system analysis is commendable\u2014the distinction between per-transaction and batched proving economics is crucial and often misunderstood, and the coverage of folding schemes shows awareness of cutting-edge developments. However, the complete absence of data availability analysis is a critical oversight. The security model of a rollup fundamentally depends on whether data is posted to Ethereum (rollup) or kept off-chain (validium), and EIP-4844's introduction of blob space creates a new middle ground that deserves careful analysis. How do blob expiration windows (currently ~18 days) affect the security assumptions? What happens to historical data availability? How do rollups handle the transition from calldata to blobs? These questions are central to understanding rollup security models. Similarly, the lack of cross-rollup interoperability analysis is problematic given that users increasingly operate across multiple L2s. The security of the rollup ecosystem is only as strong as its weakest bridge, and the proliferation of bridge designs with varying trust assumptions creates systemic risks that warrant detailed examination. The sequencer decentralization section is strong, but would benefit from more technical detail on specific proposals\u2014for instance, Espresso's HotShot consensus mechanism and its finality guarantees, or Astria's approach to sequencer set management. The manuscript correctly identifies the political economy challenges but could go further in analyzing proposed solutions like MEV-share mechanisms or encrypted mempools with specific technical implementations.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a governance and ecosystem development perspective, this manuscript makes valuable contributions to understanding the institutional structures constraining rollup decentralization. The comparative Security Council analysis in Section 4.3.2 is particularly strong, providing the kind of detailed institutional comparison that enables meaningful assessment of governance risks across rollups. The recognition that Arbitrum's elected council with constitutional constraints represents a meaningfully different governance model than zkSync Era's company-controlled multisig is important and often overlooked in technical analyses that treat all 'Security Councils' as equivalent.\n\nHowever, several governance-critical gaps require attention. First, the relationship between upgrade timelocks and stage progression deserves dedicated analysis. Stage 2 requires 30+ day timelocks specifically because this duration allows users to observe a malicious upgrade proposal and exit before it takes effect - this is the fundamental mechanism by which Stage 2 eliminates trust in governance. The manuscript should explain this mechanism clearly and analyze how current timelock durations (and the governance changes required to extend them) represent concrete barriers to Stage 2.\n\nSecond, the governance attack vectors section (4.3.4) is truncated precisely where it becomes most relevant. Regulatory pressure on identifiable council members is arguably the most significant governance risk for rollups with billions in TVL - jurisdictions could compel council members to approve censorship or asset freezing. The manuscript should complete this analysis and consider how geographic distribution of council members (mentioned for Arbitrum) mitigates or fails to mitigate this risk.\n\nThird, the analysis would benefit from examining actual governance events. How did Arbitrum's governance respond to the Foundation's controversial 750M ARB allocation? What does Optimism's handling of the Wintermute token incident reveal about governance accountability? These cases provide empirical grounding for theoretical governance analysis.\n\nFinally, consider adding discussion of governance minimization as a deliberate strategy. Some projects (like Liquity) have achieved immutability by design. What lessons do immutable protocols offer for rollups seeking to reduce governance surface area? What intermediate steps (progressively longer timelocks, narrower council powers, sunset clauses) could rollups adopt to credibly commit to governance minimization?",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript provides a solid foundation for understanding rollup stages, with particular strengths in its comparative analysis of Security Council governance structures, proof system comparisons, and game-theoretic framing of decentralization incentives. All three reviewers commend the clarity of presentation and the depth of coverage in specific areas\u2014notably the governance mechanisms across Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync Era. The technical treatment of ZK proof systems, while adequate for a general audience, demonstrates competent understanding of the landscape including recursive proofs and folding schemes.\n\nHowever, the manuscript suffers from critical structural and content gaps that prevent acceptance in its current form. Most significantly, the document is literally incomplete\u2014truncated mid-sentence in Section 4.3.4\u2014which alone necessitates revision. Beyond this, two of the three stated research objectives (data availability solutions and cross-rollup interoperability) receive minimal to no substantive treatment. Reviewer 2 correctly identifies that EIP-4844 receives only passing mention despite being fundamental to rollup economics and security models, while bridging mechanisms are entirely absent. The ZK proof systems analysis, while competent, lacks the rigor expected of a research contribution: proving throughput figures lack hardware/circuit context, proof system security incidents are not discussed, and critical implementation details (lookup arguments, aggregation pipeline failure modes) are missing.\n\nGiven this is the final round, I have carefully weighed whether these issues could be overlooked. However, the combination of an incomplete manuscript, missing core sections on stated research objectives, and insufficient technical depth in the cryptographic analysis represents too significant a gap for minor revision. The foundation is strong enough that a thorough revision addressing these gaps would likely result in an acceptable contribution.",

However, it cannot be accepted in its current incomplete state. Authors should: (1) immediately complete the truncated sections; (2) add substantive coverage of data availability and cross-rollup interoperability to fulfill the stated research scope; (3) deepen the cryptographic analysis with implementation specifics and security incident discussion. The governance analysis is publication-ready and should be preserved while expanding the technical sections. A revised submission addressing these gaps would be well-positioned for acceptance.",
