      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain governance perspective, this manuscript provides valuable analysis but misses several important dimensions. The Security Council comparison table is useful but should include information about term lengths, removal procedures, and compensation structures that affect member incentives. The discussion of governance attack vectors is appropriately comprehensive, but the mitigation strategies listed are somewhat superficial\u2014for instance, 'geographic distribution' as a mitigation for regulatory coercion requires analysis of which jurisdictions council members actually reside in and whether current distributions are adequate. The Arbitrum AIP-1 case study is relevant but dated; more recent governance decisions (such as Arbitrum's LTIPP program, Optimism's RetroPGF rounds, or the various Security Council elections) would provide better insight into current governance dynamics. The manuscript correctly identifies that Stage 2 requires governance minimization but doesn't adequately explore the political economy of this transition\u2014rollup teams and their investors have strong incentives to maintain upgrade capabilities, and the path to immutability requires overcoming these interests. Additionally, the relationship between rollup governance and the broader Ethereum governance ecosystem deserves attention, particularly as EIP-4844 parameters and future danksharding decisions will significantly impact rollup economics and thus governance incentives. The treatment of DAOs and token-based governance is notably absent despite ARB and OP being major governance tokens. Finally, the manuscript should address the emerging phenomenon of 'governance extractable value' where council members or large token holders might extract value through governance decisions short of outright theft.",

        "The DA section lacks analysis of data availability sampling (DAS) security guarantees under adversarial conditions - specifically, the manuscript doesn't address the minimum number of honest samplers required or the implications of network-level attacks on sampling",

        "Sequencer decentralization roadmaps are presented without critical evaluation - no concrete timelines from rollup teams are cited, and the analysis doesn't address why decentralization has been consistently delayed despite years of promises"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Expand the DAS security analysis to include formal treatment of sampling requirements (e.g., Celestia's requirement for ~75 light clients sampling 15 chunks each for 99% confidence), and discuss how network-level censorship of sampling requests could compromise DA guarantees",
        "Complete the cross-rollup interoperability section with analysis of: (1) ERC-7683 and intent-based bridging security models, (2) shared validity proof aggregation approaches (e.g., Polygon's AggLayer), and (3) quantified latency-security tradeoffs for different bridging mechanisms",
        "Add a critical analysis section on sequencer decentralization that examines: (1) economic incentives that favor continued centralization, (2) specific technical blockers cited by rollup teams, and (3) game-theoretic analysis of why decentralization commitments have not materialized"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a Layer 2 scalability and architecture perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid foundational understanding but requires deeper technical analysis in several key areas. The DA section correctly identifies the security degradation when moving from Ethereum blobs to alternative layers, but the treatment of DAS security is superficial. The manuscript states that light clients 'sample random chunks' with 'statistical guarantee of availability' without quantifying what this means under adversarial conditions. Specifically, DAS security depends on: (1) the erasure coding rate, (2) the number of independent samplers, (3) the sampling strategy, and (4) assumptions about network-level adversaries who might selectively censor sampling requests. The Celestia and Avail security models differ in important ways (KZG vs. Merkle proofs for chunk verification) that affect both security and performance. Additionally, the manuscript should address the 'fisherman's dilemma' in DAS - who is incentivized to actually perform sampling and report unavailability? On sequencer decentralization, the manuscript presents various approaches (leader rotation, based sequencing, shared sequencing) without critically examining why none have been deployed at scale despite years of development. The economic reality is that centralized sequencers are highly profitable (Arbitrum's sequencer generated >$50M in 2023), creating strong incentives against decentralization. The manuscript should analyze the principal-agent problem: rollup teams benefit from sequencer revenue while users bear centralization risks. For cross-rollup bridging, the truncated section misses critical recent developments. The emergence of intent-based bridging (Across, UniswapX) represents a paradigm shift from message-passing to solver-based fulfillment, with fundamentally different security properties. The manuscript should analyze how intent systems can provide faster finality than native bridges while introducing new trust assumptions around solver behavior and settlement mechanisms. Finally, the interaction between DA choices and bridge security deserves more attention - a validium using Celestia DA connected via a trusted bridge to Ethereum has compounded trust assumptions that significantly degrade the effective security below what either component provides individually.",

      "suggestions": [
        "Add a section on recursive proofs and proof aggregation: explain how systems like Starknet's SHARP use recursion, how Nova/SuperNova folding schemes reduce per-step costs, and how these advances affect the decentralization timeline",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a ZK proof systems perspective, this manuscript correctly identifies the high-level challenges but lacks the technical depth expected for a comprehensive research report. The proof system comparison table, while useful, conflates different metrics inappropriately - for instance, 'prover time per tx' is not how ZK-rollups operate; they prove batches of thousands of transactions, and the relevant metric is proving throughput and latency for batch finalization. The manuscript should discuss how zkSync Era's Boojum prover achieves ~10 TPS proving throughput through parallelization and GPU acceleration, or how Scroll's proving pipeline handles EVM trace generation separately from constraint satisfaction.\n\nMore critically, the manuscript entirely omits the most significant recent advances in proof systems: folding schemes and incrementally verifiable computation (IVC). Nova, SuperNova, and HyperNova represent paradigm shifts in recursive proving that directly address the 'proof generation costs' bottleneck identified in Section 4.1.2. Similarly, the STARK-to-SNARK wrapping technique used by Polygon zkEVM and others (proving a STARK verification circuit inside a SNARK for cheaper L1 verification) deserves mention as it represents a practical solution to the proof size vs. verification cost tradeoff.\n\nThe discussion of trusted setups is accurate but incomplete - the manuscript should note that universal trusted setups (like Aztec's ignition ceremony for PLONK) can be reused across circuits, significantly reducing the practical burden compared to circuit-specific setups like Groth16. The security assumption table correctly identifies the Knowledge of Exponent assumption as 'Medium' confidence, but should elaborate that this assumption is non-falsifiable and represents a genuine concern for Groth16's long-term security.\n\nFinally, the prover decentralization discussion would benefit from concrete analysis of the cryptographic requirements: How do you verify that a delegated prover computed correctly without re-doing the work? What role do commitment schemes play in prover accountability? These questions are central to the 'decentralized prover market' vision but are not addressed.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript provides a well-structured and technically competent analysis of rollup maturity stages, with particular strengths in comparative governance analysis, Security Council structures, and data availability security models. All three reviewers acknowledge the clarity of presentation and the solid foundational coverage of the stage framework. The comparative tables and articulation of the 'weakest link' problem in cross-rollup security are consistently praised as valuable contributions to the literature.\n\nHowever, the reviewers identify several substantive gaps that prevent acceptance in the current form. Most critically, the manuscript appears incomplete\u2014cutting off mid-section on standardization efforts and leaving the cross-rollup interoperability analysis unfinished. The ZK proof systems coverage lacks depth on recursive proving, proof aggregation, and hardware acceleration, which are central to understanding prover decentralization timelines. Additionally, the treatment of sequencer decentralization lacks critical evaluation of why promised timelines have not materialized, and the proof generation cost analysis needs revision to reflect batched proving economics rather than misleading per-transaction metrics.\n\nThe issues identified are addressable within a revision cycle. The core technical framework is sound, and the requested additions (completing truncated sections, deepening ZK coverage, adding critical analysis of decentralization delays) would strengthen rather than fundamentally restructure the manuscript. Given this is round 2 of 3, the authors have opportunity to address these concerns comprehensively.",
