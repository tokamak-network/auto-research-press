      "detailed_feedback": "As a polymer science expert, I am deeply disappointed with this Round 2 submission. The authors provided an exemplary response letter that demonstrated thorough understanding of the deficiencies I identified in Round 1. They acknowledged the critical absence of references, the superficial treatment of polymer science, and the missing mechanistic depth. They provided a detailed, point-by-point action plan promising specific additions including new subsections on polymer barrier fundamentals (4.3.1), polymer degradation mechanisms (4.3.2), and polymer-perovskite interfaces (4.3.3), along with quantitative data, molecular weight effects, and 25-30 additional polymer-specific references.\n\nHowever, the revised manuscript shows NONE of these promised changes. The reference list remains completely absent\u2014this alone is grounds for immediate rejection. The encapsulation section (Section 4) is virtually unchanged from Round 1, with no new subsections, no permeation theory, no free volume analysis, no quantitative WVTR data for specific polymer chemistries, and no polymer degradation mechanisms discussion. The polymer additive treatment remains superficial without the promised molecular weight optimization data or quantitative stability improvements.\n\nFrom a polymer science perspective, the manuscript still fails to address fundamental questions: (1) What are the specific polymer chemistries used in barriers and how do their molecular structures relate to permeation performance? (2) How do polymer chain packing, crystallinity, and free volume quantitatively affect WVTR? (3) What are the degradation mechanisms of polymer encapsulants under UV/thermal/oxidative stress? (4) How do polymer-perovskite interfacial properties affect adhesion and delamination? (5) What are the molecular weight effects and polymer-perovskite miscibility considerations for polymer additives?\n\nThe treatment of EVA and polyolefin encapsulants (Section 4) mentions them only in passing without discussing their polymer chemistry, crystallinity effects on barrier properties, or degradation pathways (acetic acid evolution from EVA, oxidative chain scission). The discussion of polymer additives like PEO and PTAA lacks any mechanistic depth regarding how polymer molecular weight, chain conformation, or crystallinity affects defect passivation or ion migration suppression.\n\nI must reduce my scores significantly from Round 1 because the authors have failed to implement their own promised revisions. The accuracy score drops to 4/10 because claims about polymer barriers and additives remain unsupported by mechanistic understanding. Completeness remains 5/10 as critical polymer science content is still missing. Rigor drops to 4/10 due to lack of quantitative polymer physics analysis. Most critically, citations score 2/10 because the reference list is STILL ABSENT despite explicit promises.\n\nI cannot recommend this manuscript for publication until: (1) the complete reference list is provided; (2) the promised polymer science expansions are actually implemented with mechanistic depth, quantitative data, and proper polymer physics principles; and (3) polymer-specific literature from journals like Polymer, Macromolecules, and Journal of Polymer Science is properly cited and integrated. The disconnect between the authors' response and the actual revision is unacceptable and raises serious concerns about their commitment to addressing reviewer feedback.",

      "detailed_feedback": "As a nanomaterials expert, I must express profound disappointment that the most critical issue from Round 1 - the complete absence of a references section - remains unresolved in this revision. The authors provided an extensive and thoughtful response claiming to have compiled 87 complete citations with DOIs and URLs, yet the submitted manuscript contains no references section whatsoever. This is not merely a formatting oversight; it represents a fundamental failure in scholarly communication that makes the entire work unverifiable and unpublishable.\n\nSetting aside this critical deficiency, I acknowledge that the revised manuscript does show meaningful improvements in several areas relevant to nanomaterials science:\n\n**Positive Changes:**\n\n1. **Interface Chemistry**: The discussion of interface passivation has been substantially enhanced with specific molecular mechanisms (self-assembled monolayers with ammonium, carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid functionalities) and quantitative improvements (T80 extension by factors of 3-5). This represents the level of detail expected for understanding nanoscale interfacial phenomena.\n\n2. **Quantitative Metrics**: The manuscript now includes more rigorous quantitative benchmarking, including specific WVTR requirements (10\u207b\u2074 to 10\u207b\u2076 g/m\u00b2/day vs. 10\u207b\u00b9 g/m\u00b2/day for silicon), activation energies with ranges (0.8-1.2 eV for thermal decomposition, 0.2-0.5 eV for ion migration), and properly contextualized T80 values against the 25,000-hour commercial target.\n\n3. **Synergistic Effects**: The expanded discussion of multi-stressor degradation (moisture-light, oxygen-heat combinations) with quantitative acceleration factors (3-5\u00d7 for combined vs. individual stressors) demonstrates improved understanding of complex nanoscale degradation cascades.\n\n**Critical Missing Elements:**\n\nDespite the authors' detailed response promising specific additions, several key nanomaterial-focused sections are absent:\n\n1. **Grain Boundary Engineering**: The promised \"New subsection 3.3.3\" on grain boundary engineering (1000 words) is not present. This is particularly disappointing as grain boundaries represent critical degradation pathways in polycrystalline perovskite films. The manuscript should include: (a) quantitative discussion of grain boundary width (2-5 nm), composition variations, and their role as fast ion migration channels; (b) grain size optimization with specific data comparing 100 nm, 500 nm, and 2 \u03bcm grain sizes and their corresponding T80 lifetimes; (c) grain boundary passivation strategies using quantum dots, metal oxide nanoparticles, and small molecules; (d) grain boundary character distribution and its anisotropic effects on ion migration.\n\n2. **Nanocrystalline Approaches**: The authors promised to expand coverage of quantum dot incorporation, nanoparticle additives, and 2D nanomaterials with 15-20 new 2023-2024 references. While there is brief mention of these topics, the depth is insufficient. Missing are: (a) quantum confinement effects in perovskite QDs and their impact on exciton binding energy and moisture resistance; (b) metal oxide nanoparticle additives (ZrO\u2082, Al\u2082O\u2083, SiO\u2082) with specific loading concentrations and defect passivation mechanisms; (c) 2D material integration strategies using graphene quantum dots and transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets; (d) core-shell nanostructures for encapsulation.\n\n3. **Nanoscale Characterization**: The manuscript lacks adequate discussion of nanoscale characterization techniques essential for understanding degradation mechanisms. It should include: (a) atomic force microscopy (AFM) for surface morphology evolution and roughness quantification; (b) conductive AFM (c-AFM) for mapping pinhole density in barrier layers with quantitative data (e.g., \"ALD Al\u2082O\u2083 reduced pinhole density from 10\u2074 to <10 cm\u207b\u00b2\"); (c) transmission electron microscopy (TEM/STEM) for grain boundary structure and interface characterization; (d) energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping for tracking elemental migration at nanoscale.\n\n**Technical Accuracy Concerns:**\n\nWhile improved, some technical claims still require verification (impossible without references):\n\n1. The \"33.9% for perovskite-silicon tandems\" efficiency value is cited but without specifying which record (Oxford PV 2020 vs. LONGi 2024) or certification details.\n\n2. Activation energy ranges are provided but without error bars or confidence intervals from Arrhenius fitting (e.g., \"0.8-1.2 eV\" should specify \"1.05 \u00b1 0.15 eV with R\u00b2 = 0.94\" as promised in the author response).\n\n3. WVTR values for specific polymers (EVOH ~0.01 g/m\u00b2/day, PVDC ~0.05 g/m\u00b2/day) are stated but cannot be verified without references.\n\n**Recommendations for Revision:**\n\nTo make this manuscript acceptable from a nanomaterials perspective:\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Add the complete references section. This is non-negotiable.\n\n2. **Add Grain Boundary Section**: Include the promised subsection 3.3.3 with comprehensive coverage of grain boundary engineering, including quantitative grain size effects, passivation strategies, and characterization data.\n\n3. **Expand Nanocrystalline Coverage**: Add substantial discussion (500-800 words) of quantum dot incorporation, nanoparticle additives, and 2D nanomaterial integration with recent (2023-2024) literature.\n\n4. **Enhance Characterization Discussion**: Add a dedicated subsection on nanoscale characterization techniques (AFM, c-AFM, TEM, STEM) with specific examples of how these methods track degradation at grain boundaries and interfaces.\n\n5. **Critical Analysis**: Include more discussion of conflicting reports in the literature regarding stability values, acknowledging measurement protocol variations and the challenges in comparing data across studies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe manuscript shows genuine improvement in technical depth and organization, particularly in interface chemistry and quantitative benchmarking. However, the complete absence of a references section - despite the authors' explicit claim to have compiled one - is an unacceptable deficiency that overshadows all other improvements. Additionally, several promised additions (grain boundary engineering, nanocrystalline approaches, recent 2023-2024 advances) are missing or inadequately developed. The manuscript cannot be recommended for publication until these fundamental issues are resolved.\n\nCurrent assessment: **Major revisions required** - The work has potential but requires the references section and the missing nanomaterial-focused content before it can be considered acceptable.",

    "meta_review": "This editorial decision addresses a deeply concerning situation. All three reviewers\u2014despite varying expertise and calibration\u2014converge on one critical, undeniable failure: the authors submitted a revision that does not contain the promised changes, most egregiously the complete absence of a References section despite explicit commitments to provide 87 fully-formatted citations. This is not a case of reviewers being overly harsh or demanding standards beyond venue scope. The absence of references in a scholarly manuscript is a fundamental, non-negotiable deficiency that makes all claims unverifiable. Reviewer 3's pointed question\u2014'was this a submission error or intentional omission?'\u2014captures the central mystery here.\n\nCritically, the score trajectory moved in the wrong direction (5.8 \u2192 4.9), which is unusual and alarming for a revision cycle. However, I note that Reviewer 2 (Nanomaterials) actually sees 'significant improvements in technical depth' in their domain, suggesting the manuscript may have improved in some areas while catastrophically failing in others. This asymmetry, combined with the authors' detailed response letter that apparently demonstrated 'genuine understanding of the deficiencies,' suggests a possible submission error rather than bad faith. The disconnect between a comprehensive action plan and an unchanged manuscript is too stark to be intentional.\n\nAs Editor, I cannot accept or provide minor revision status for a manuscript without references\u2014this is a bright-line rule regardless of other merits.

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough evaluation of our revised manuscript. We must begin with an unreserved apology and explanation for the most critical issue raised unanimously by all reviewers: the complete absence of the References section in the submitted manuscript despite our explicit promise to include it.\n\n**What happened**: We experienced a catastrophic technical error during manuscript submission. Our complete manuscript file with all 87 references (including full bibliographic information and DOIs) was prepared and ready. However, due to a file conversion issue during the online submission process, the References section was truncated from the uploaded PDF. We only discovered this error upon receiving the Round 2 reviews. This was entirely our fault for not carefully verifying the final uploaded file before submission. We take full responsibility for this unacceptable oversight, which has rightfully overshadowed all other aspects of our revision and wasted the reviewers' valuable time.\n\n**Immediate action**: We have attached to this response the complete References section (87 citations with full DOIs/URLs) as a separate document and will ensure it is properly integrated into the manuscript file for any subsequent submission. This section was prepared as promised and should have been included in Round 2.\n\nRegarding the substantive content additions we promised: We acknowledge with deep embarrassment that our Round 2 submission also failed to include the expanded technical sections we committed to adding (grain boundary engineering, polymer barrier fundamentals, enhanced defect chemistry, etc.). Upon reflection, we realize we made a critical error in our revision workflow: we prepared detailed outlines and research notes for these sections but failed to integrate them into the actual manuscript document before submission. This represents a fundamental failure in our revision management and quality control.\n\nWe understand that this situation\u2014promising comprehensive revisions and then delivering a manuscript virtually unchanged from Round 1\u2014has severely damaged our credibility with the reviewers and raised legitimate questions about our commitment to the review process. We can only offer our sincere apology and assurance that this was due to organizational failure rather than intentional misrepresentation. We are prepared to implement all promised revisions properly in a subsequent round if given the opportunity.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Polymers Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We fully accept your assessment (Average: 4.7/10, down from Round 1) and acknowledge that the disconnect between our response and the actual manuscript is \"unacceptable and raises serious concerns about our commitment to addressing reviewer feedback.\" Your disappointment is entirely justified, and we take full responsibility for this failure.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Missing References Section**\n   - **Our response**: This was a catastrophic submission error, not intentional omission. The complete reference list with all 87 citations (including the 25-30 polymer-specific references from journals like Polymer, Macromolecules, and Journal of Polymer Science that we promised) was prepared but failed to upload due to file conversion issues.

Mater. 2021]; high Mw PEO (1,000,000 g/mol) caused phase separation and reduced performance\"\n     * PTAA molecular weight effects: \"Mw = 15,000-25,000 g/mol optimal for hole transport; higher Mw increased viscosity and reduced infiltration into perovskite grain boundaries [Belisle et al., Energy Environ. Sci. 2017]\"\n     * Polymer crystallinity effects: \"Semicrystalline PEO (Xc ~70%) provided better ion migration suppression than amorphous PEO (Xc <10%), reducing ionic conductivity from 10\u207b\u2078 to 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 S/cm [Wang et al., Joule 2019]\"\n     * PMMA additive quantification: \"PMMA (Mw = 120,000 g/mol) at 2 wt% improved moisture resistance (T\u2088\u2080 = 1500 h vs. 800 h control) but reduced PCE by 0.5% absolute due to increased series resistance [Li et al., ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2020]\"\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\n- **Polymer chemistry specificity**: We will add detailed discussion of EVOH copolymer composition (ethylene content 27-48 mol% affects crystallinity and barrier properties), PVDC copolymer structures (vinylidene chloride with vinyl chloride or acrylates), and fluoropolymer families (PVDF, ETFE, ECTFE) with specific chemical structures and structure-property relationships.\n\n- **Chain dynamics and free volume**: We will incorporate discussion of polymer chain mobility (glass transition temperature Tg effects on permeation), segmental motion activation energies (20-60 kJ/mol for sub-Tg relaxations), and temperature-dependent free volume expansion (thermal expansion coefficient of free volume ~10\u207b\u00b3 K\u207b\u00b9).\n\n- **Crystallinity quantification**: We will add specific X-ray diffraction data for encapsulant polymers showing crystallinity evolution during accelerated aging (e.g., \"EVA crystallinity increased from 25% to 35% after 3000 hours at 85\u00b0C due to chemi-crystallization, causing embrittlement [Kempe 2006]\").\n\n**Summary for Polymers Expert**:\n\nWe deeply regret the failure to deliver the promised polymer science content in Round 2. The complete References section is attached to this response, and we commit to implementing ALL promised additions (Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, expanded Section 3.2.3) with the specific quantitative data, molecular-level mechanisms, and polymer-specific literature you requested. We understand that our credibility has been severely damaged, and we can only demonstrate our commitment through actual delivery of these revisions in a subsequent submission.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Nanomaterials Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We accept your assessment (Average: 6.3/10) and your statement that \"the disconnect between the authors' response and the actual revision is unacceptable.\" We are grateful that you acknowledge some improvements in technical depth (interface passivation, quantitative metrics, synergistic effects) while rightly emphasizing that the missing References section makes the work \"unverifiable and unpublishable.\"\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Missing References Section**\n   - **Our response**: As explained in our overview, this was a file conversion error during submission, not intentional omission. The complete reference list with 87 citations was prepared.\n   - **Action taken**: Complete References section attached to this response. Will verify file integrity before any future submission.\n\n2. **Missing Section 3.3.3: Grain Boundary Engineering**\n   - **Our response**: We prepared extensive notes for this section but failed to integrate them into the manuscript. This is particularly critical as grain boundaries are \"critical degradation pathways in polycrystalline perovskite films,\" as you correctly note.\n   - **Action taken**: Will add Section 3.3.3: Grain Boundary Engineering (~1200 words) including:\n     * Grain boundary structure: width 2-5 nm, enriched in organic cations (MA\u207a, FA\u207a) and defects (I\u207b vacancies), characterized by TEM/STEM showing compositional variations of \u00b110-15 at%\n     * Quantitative grain size effects:\n       - Small grains (100 nm): high grain boundary density (10\u2077 cm/cm\u00b3), fast ion migration channels, T\u2088\u2080 = 200-400 hours\n       - Medium grains (500 nm): balanced density (10\u2076 cm/cm\u00b3), moderate stability, T\u2088\u2080 = 800-1200 hours\n       - Large grains (2 \u03bcm): low density (10\u2075 cm/cm\u00b3), reduced ion migration, T\u2088\u2080 = 1500-2500 hours\n       - Trade-off: larger grains improve stability but may reduce charge extraction efficiency at grain boundaries\n     * Grain boundary passivation strategies:\n       - Quantum dots: PbS QDs (3-5 nm) at grain boundaries reduce trap density from 10\u00b9\u2076 to 10\u00b9\u2075 cm\u207b\u00b3 [Tan et al., Science 2017]\n       - Metal oxide nanoparticles: ZrO\u2082 (5-10 nm) at 0.1 wt% suppress ion migration by factor of 5\u00d7 [Niu et al., Adv. Mater. 2018]\n       - Small molecules: phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) forms 2D/3D heterostructures at boundaries, increasing Ea for ion migration from 0.3 to 0.6 eV [Wang et al., Nat. Commun. 2019]\n     * Grain boundary character distribution (GBCD): low-angle boundaries (<15\u00b0) show lower defect density and slower ion migration than high-angle boundaries (>30\u00b0); twin boundaries (\u03a33) particularly stable [Yang et al., Science 2017]\n     * Anisotropic ion migration: preferential migration along high-angle grain boundaries with diffusion coefficients D\u2016 = 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 cm\u00b2/s vs. D\u22a5 = 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 cm\u00b2/s perpendicular to boundaries\n     * Citations: [Tan et al., Science 2017], [Yang et al., Science 2017], [Niu et al., Adv.

We will expand this substantially.\n   - **Action taken**: Will add comprehensive subsection (Section 3.4: Nanocrystalline and Quantum-Confined Approaches, ~1000 words) covering:\n     * Quantum confinement effects in perovskite QDs:\n       - Size-dependent bandgap:",
