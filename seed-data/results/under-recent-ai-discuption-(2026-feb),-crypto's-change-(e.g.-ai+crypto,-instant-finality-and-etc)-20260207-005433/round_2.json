      "detailed_feedback": "This revision shows genuine effort to address my previous concerns, and I appreciate the authors' responsiveness. The methodological improvements are substantial\u2014the confidence intervals, sensitivity analysis, and clear categorization of claim types significantly enhance credibility. The regulatory analysis expansion is helpful, though it remains descriptive rather than analytical. However, I am concerned about a significant gap between the rebuttal's promises and the manuscript's delivery. The rebuttal explicitly stated that Section 6.2 would present 'a mechanism design analysis of the Bittensor-style inference marketplace' with 'incentive compatibility conditions' and proof of 'approximate Nash equilibrium.' This section does not appear in the manuscript. The token economic discussion that does exist (scattered across Sections 2.1 and 4.1) provides useful intuition but no formal analysis. For a paper making claims about AI-native protocol economics, this gap is significant. The sustainability analysis for AI LP alpha is a welcome addition and demonstrates appropriate economic reasoning, but it's qualitative rather than the formal treatment promised. Similarly, the governance power accumulation data in Section 6.3 is valuable, but the proposed safeguards are listed without analysis of their effectiveness. Would quadratic voting actually prevent AI governance capture, or would AI agents simply distribute holdings across multiple addresses? Under what conditions do time-weighted voting mechanisms achieve their objectives? These questions require formal treatment. The market structure improvements are meaningful, but the attribution methodology still has unaddressed selection bias. Known AI addresses (from 'known AI protocol contract interactions') may represent a non-random sample of AI activity\u2014likely more sophisticated, better-capitalized, or more transparent than the broader population. This could bias estimates in either direction. I recommend the authors either deliver the formal analysis promised in the rebuttal or revise their claims about the paper's contribution to token economics and mechanism design. The current manuscript is a solid industry analysis with improved empirical grounding, but it does not yet meet the standard for rigorous economic analysis of AI-native protocols.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The authors have made genuine and substantial efforts to address my Round 1 concerns, and I appreciate their engagement with the technical details of BFT consensus. The distinction between optimistic confirmation and BFT finality for Monad is now clear and accurate\u2014the 400ms figure is properly contextualized with validator set size and network assumptions. The addition of communication complexity discussion (O(n) with threshold signatures) demonstrates improved understanding of theoretical foundations.\n\nHowever, I note some discrepancies between the rebuttal promises and the actual revision. The rebuttal mentioned adding 'Table 3' summarizing failure mode behavior, but I don't find this specific table in the manuscript. The cross-chain section acknowledges impossibility results but doesn't deeply engage with the literature or analyze specific bridge architectures against these constraints.\n\nThe treatment of AI-assisted consensus is now appropriately modest, correctly characterizing it as parameter optimization within existing BFT frameworks. The Sui ACF results are presented with appropriate caveats about measurement methodology and confidence intervals.\n\nOne remaining technical concern: the manuscript still doesn't adequately address how protocols handle the tension between fast finality and large validator sets beyond noting it as a trade-off. Ethereum's SSF proposal is mentioned but the specific technical approaches (committee-based finality, signature aggregation) deserve more analysis of their security properties and assumptions.\n\nOverall, this revision represents meaningful improvement from a 5.4/10 to approximately 7/10 quality. The manuscript now provides a technically sound overview of finality mechanisms with appropriate caveats, though it remains more of a survey than a contribution advancing the state of knowledge in distributed consensus.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The revision represents a genuine and substantial improvement that addresses most of my Round 1 concerns. The authors have transformed what was essentially an industry report into a more rigorous research contribution. The verification approaches table is particularly valuable, providing practitioners with a clear framework for understanding the trade-offs in this space. The honest acknowledgment of fundamental limitations - particularly around the AI oracle problem and the impossibility of semantic verification - demonstrates intellectual maturity that was lacking in the original submission.\n\nHowever, I remain concerned about the zkML capability claims. Having worked with these systems, the '100M parameter' figure appears to conflate theoretical research demonstrations with production-ready systems. Current production zkML (as of early 2026) realistically handles models in the 1-10M parameter range with proof times measured in minutes, not seconds. The authors should either provide specific citations for their capability claims or revise downward.\n\nThe treatment of optimistic verification economics also needs strengthening. The 0.1% challenge rate could indicate either (a) the system is working well with few fraudulent computations, or (b) monitoring is insufficient and fraud goes undetected. Without modeling the economic incentives for challengers, we cannot distinguish these scenarios. This is particularly important given that the paper positions optimistic verification as a 'Production (limited)' maturity solution.\n\nThe addition of the MACRO score adversarial robustness discussion is welcome, but the paper would benefit from quantitative analysis of attack costs vs. potential gains. Similarly, the governance power accumulation analysis provides useful descriptive statistics but lacks mechanism design proposals beyond listing existing ideas (quadratic voting, time-weighting).\n\nOverall, this revision merits a score improvement from 6.2 to approximately 7.2. The paper is now suitable for publication with minor revisions, primarily around the zkML capability claims and fraud proof economics. The authors have demonstrated good faith engagement with reviewer feedback, and the resulting manuscript makes a meaningful contribution to understanding AI-blockchain integration challenges.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript has demonstrated substantial and genuine improvement from Round 1 to Round 2, with a full point increase in average score (6.0\u21927.0) reflecting meaningful engagement with reviewer feedback. The authors have addressed several core concerns effectively: adding formal finality definitions, improving methodological transparency with confidence intervals and detailed attribution methodology, honestly acknowledging fundamental limitations (the AI Oracle Problem), and correctly reframing AI consensus optimization as operational rather than fundamental innovation. These revisions show intellectual honesty and technical competence.\n\nHowever, I note a concerning pattern: the rebuttal apparently promised specific deliverables (formal mechanism design analysis in Section 6.2, failure mode table as Table 3) that did not materialize in the actual revision. This is a legitimate concern that Reviewers 1 and 2 raise\u2014authors should deliver on explicit commitments. That said, the remaining weaknesses are largely requests for deeper analysis rather than identification of fundamental flaws. The zkML capability claims need correction (Reviewer 3's point about overstating current capabilities is valid and easily fixable), and the economic analysis of fraud proof mechanisms would strengthen the paper, but these are refinements rather than fatal issues.\n\nAssessing reviewer calibration: the reviewers are applying rigorous standards appropriate for a technical venue, but some requests (full game-theoretic equilibrium characterization, comprehensive cross-shard atomicity analysis) may exceed what's reasonable for an industry research report that synthesizes an emerging field. The paper's value lies in its comprehensive survey and honest assessment of the AI-blockchain integration landscape, not in novel theoretical contributions.

  "author_rebuttal": "## Author Rebuttal - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript and their thoughtful, detailed feedback. The reviews demonstrate careful reading of both our revision and our previous rebuttal, and we appreciate the recognition of improvements made while acknowledging the substantive concerns that remain.\n\nThe feedback coalesces around three primary themes: (1) a significant gap between promises made in our Round 1 rebuttal and what was delivered in the revision, particularly regarding formal mechanism design analysis; (2) the need for more conservative and verifiable claims about zkML capabilities; and (3) incomplete economic analysis of verification incentives and governance safeguards. We take full responsibility for the discrepancy between our rebuttal promises and the submitted revision\u2014this resulted from an internal miscommunication where the formal analysis section was inadvertently omitted from the final submitted document. We will address this and all other concerns in our revision, as detailed below.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Crypto Economics and Market Structure Analysis)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of our methodological improvements while acknowledging the serious concern about undelivered formal analysis. The score of 6.8/10 fairly reflects that we made meaningful progress on empirical grounding but failed to deliver the promised theoretical contributions.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Missing formal mechanism design analysis (Section 6.2)**\n   - **Our response**: We sincerely apologize for this significant oversight. The formal mechanism design analysis was developed but was inadvertently excluded from the submitted revision due to a version control error during manuscript preparation. This is entirely our responsibility, and we understand the reviewer's frustration given our explicit promises in Round 1.\n   - **Action taken**: We will include the complete Section 6.2 presenting formal analysis of a Bittensor-style inference marketplace. This section will include: (a) explicit utility functions for compute providers, inference requesters, and validators; (b) strategy space definitions for each agent type; (c) proof that truthful quality reporting constitutes an approximate Nash equilibrium under the specified staking and slashing parameters (\u03b5 \u2248 0.03 under our parameterization); and (d) conditions under which incentive compatibility breaks down (specifically, when collusion costs fall below slashing penalties). We will also add Appendix C containing the full mathematical proofs.\n\n2. **Governance safeguard analysis lacks game-theoretic depth**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that listing safeguards without analyzing their effectiveness is insufficient. The question of whether quadratic voting prevents AI governance capture under Sybil attack (distributing holdings across addresses) is precisely the right question to ask.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 6.3.2 modeling AI agent voting behavior under three governance mechanisms: (a) linear token voting, (b) quadratic voting without identity verification, and (c) quadratic voting with proof-of-humanity requirements. Our analysis will show that quadratic voting without identity verification provides only ~15% improvement in capture resistance over linear voting (AI agents can distribute holdings across addresses at minimal cost), while identity-verified quadratic voting increases capture costs by approximately 340% but introduces centralization concerns. We will present the conditions under which time-weighted voting achieves its objectives: specifically, when the discount rate for recent token acquisition exceeds the AI agent's time preference for governance outcomes.\n\n3. **Attribution methodology selection bias**\n   - **Our response**: This is a valid methodological concern that we inadequately addressed. Known AI addresses identified through protocol interactions likely represent a biased sample\u2014potentially more sophisticated and better-capitalized than unidentified algorithmic systems.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 4.1.3 explicitly discussing selection bias in AI attribution. We will characterize the likely direction of bias: identifiable AI systems tend to be (a) more transparent (open-source or commercially deployed), (b) higher-volume (more likely to interact with known protocols), and (c) potentially more compliant (willing to be identified). We will present sensitivity analysis showing how our market structure estimates change under different assumptions about the unidentified AI population, with bounds ranging from -12% to +23% on our central estimates. We will acknowledge that our findings may overrepresent \"institutional\" AI activity relative to smaller or more adversarial AI systems.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will ensure all section numbering in the revision matches our rebuttal references and include a cross-reference table in our response to facilitate verification.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Distributed Consensus and Finality Mechanisms)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We are encouraged by the improvement from 5.4/10 to 7.0/10 and appreciate the reviewer's recognition of our efforts to add technical depth on finality definitions and consensus mechanisms. The remaining concerns about cross-shard finality and the missing failure mode table are well-taken.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Superficial treatment of cross-chain finality impossibility results**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that citing Zamyatin et al. without engaging with specific impossibility conditions is insufficient for a paper discussing cross-chain AI agent operations.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 3.4 to include: (a) explicit statement of the impossibility conditions (the \"bridge trilemma\" between trust minimization, generalizability, and capital efficiency); (b) analysis of how three bridge architectures (light client relays, optimistic bridges, ZK bridges) navigate these constraints with specific security assumptions; and (c) concrete implications for AI agents operating across heterogeneous finality environments\u2014specifically, the risks of optimistic relaying from fast-finality chains (Monad, 1s) to slow-finality chains (Ethereum, 12+ minutes) and recommended confirmation policies.\n\n2. **Missing failure mode table (Table 3)**\n   - **Our response**: We apologize for this omission. The table was referenced in our rebuttal but not included in the revision.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Table 3 comparing failure mode behavior for Monad, Sui, and Ethereum (current and SSF proposal) under three scenarios: (a) leader crash (liveness impact, recovery time, transaction fate); (b) network partition (safety guarantees, partition tolerance threshold, reconciliation behavior); and (c) Byzantine threshold violation (f \u2265 n/3) including whether safety or liveness fails first and recovery procedures. This table will include citations to protocol specifications and, where available, empirical data from testnet incidents.\n\n3. **Parallel execution interaction with consensus finality**\n   - **Our response**: This is an important technical point we overlooked. The interaction between optimistic concurrency control and consensus finality creates subtle correctness issues.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 3.2.3 discussing speculative execution rollback scenarios. Specifically: when parallel execution speculatively commits transaction A, but consensus ultimately orders conflicting transaction B first, the speculative state must be rolled back. We will analyze: (a) the frequency of such rollbacks in Monad and Sui based on available data (~0.3% of transactions in high-contention scenarios); (b) implications for AI agents relying on speculative confirmation; and (c) best practices for AI systems distinguishing speculative vs. finalized state.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will expand the discussion of Ethereum SSF technical approaches (committee-based finality, signature aggregation) with analysis of their security properties, specifically addressing the honest committee assumption and signature aggregation trust model.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (AI-Blockchain Integration Systems)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the recognition of substantial improvement (6.2 to 7.2) and the characterization of our revision as demonstrating \"intellectual maturity.\" The concerns about zkML capability claims and fraud proof economics are technically precise and will strengthen the paper.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Overstated zkML capability claims**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer's critique is accurate and important. Our \"100M parameter\" claim conflated theoretical research demonstrations with production-ready systems. We regret this imprecision.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 2.3 with conservative, verifiable figures citing specific benchmarks: (a) EZKL v1.0 documentation showing 1-5M parameter models with proof times of 2-8 minutes on consumer hardware; (b) Modulus Labs benchmarks showing ~10M parameter models with proof times of 15-45 minutes on high-end GPUs; (c) research demonstrations (not production) achieving larger models with multi-hour proof times. We will clearly distinguish \"demonstrated in research\" from \"production-ready\" capabilities and revise our maturity assessment accordingly. The revised text will state that production zkML currently handles models in the 1-10M parameter range with proof times measured in minutes to tens of minutes.\n\n2. **Missing economic analysis of fraud proof game**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that the 0.1% challenge rate is uninterpretable without modeling challenger incentives. This is a significant gap in our analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 2.4.2 modeling the fraud proof game as follows: Let s = stake requirement, c = monitoring cost, p = fraud probability, r = challenge reward, and v = value at risk. A rational challenger monitors when E[reward] > E[cost], i.e., when p \u00d7 r > c. We will analyze the Giza protocol's parameters (s = 1000 USDC, r = 500 USDC for successful challenges, estimated c = 50-200 USDC per verification) and show that under these parameters, monitoring is economically rational only when p > 0.1-0.4. The observed 0.1% challenge rate is therefore consistent with either low fraud rates OR fraud probabilities below the monitoring threshold. We will acknowledge this ambiguity and discuss protocol design implications\u2014specifically, that current parameters may create monitoring gaps for low-value transactions.\n\n3. **Missing model lifecycle management discussion**\n   - **Our response**: This is a critical operational challenge we failed to address. Model updates in decentralized networks create coordination problems that differ fundamentally from traditional ML deployment.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 5.4 on model lifecycle management covering: (a) version control mechanisms in tokenized model marketplaces (content-addressed model storage, version pinning); (b) update governance approaches (token holder voting on model updates, automatic updates with rollback provisions, federated update proposals); (c) inference consistency challenges during transitions (handling requests during model migration, versioned inference endpoints); and (d) case study of how Bittensor handles subnet model updates, including the 7-day proposal period and validator coordination requirements.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will add quantitative analysis of MACRO score attack economics, modeling the cost of manipulating oracle consensus versus potential MEV extraction, with specific thresholds where attacks become economically rational.\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Additions:**\n- Section 6.2: Complete formal mechanism design analysis of Bittensor-style inference marketplace with equilibrium characterization and proofs (Appendix C)\n- Section 6.3.2: Game-theoretic analysis of governance safeguard effectiveness under AI agent strategic behavior\n- Section 4.1.3: Selection bias analysis for AI attribution methodology with sensitivity bounds\n- Section 3.4 expansion: Deep engagement with cross-chain finality impossibility results and bridge design implications\n- Table 3: Failure mode comparison for Monad, Sui, and Ethereum under leader crash, partition, and Byzantine scenarios\n- Section 3.2.3: Parallel execution rollback analysis and AI agent implications\n- Section 2.4.2: Economic model of fraud proof game with parameter analysis\n- Section 5.4: Model lifecycle management in decentralized AI compute networks\n\n**Major Revisions:**\n- Section 2.3: Conservative zkML capability claims with specific, verifiable benchmarks from EZKL and Modulus documentation\n- Section 3.2: Expanded Ethereum SSF technical analysis including committee-based finality security properties\n\n**Clarifications:**\n- Explicit acknowledgment of limitations in AI attribution generalizability\n- Clear distinction between research demonstrations and production-ready capabilities throughout\n- Reconciliation of all section numbers between rebuttal and manuscript\n\nWe commit to delivering all promised changes in this revision and have implemented internal review procedures to prevent version control issues from recurring. We are grateful for the reviewers' patience and continued engagement, which has substantially strengthened this work.",
