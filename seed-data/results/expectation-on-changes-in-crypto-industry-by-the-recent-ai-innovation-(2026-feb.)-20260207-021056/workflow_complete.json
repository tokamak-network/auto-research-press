The treatment of market microstructure changes is superficial - while the paper mentions tighter spreads and faster arbitrage resolution, it fails to analyze the economic implications for market makers, the sustainability of liquidity provision under AI competition, or the potential for adverse selection problems when sophisticated AI systems trade against retail participants. The claim that AI market makers have reduced spreads by 25% needs contextualization: what are the implications for market maker profitability, and is this sustainable? The discussion of AI agents managing $4.2B in DeFi assets lacks critical analysis of the economic viability of these operations - what are the fee structures, how do gas costs affect profitability, and what happens to protocol economics when AI agents optimize away inefficiencies that previously subsidized other users? The regulatory section inadequately addresses the compliance costs and operational challenges of running AI-crypto services across jurisdictions. For instance, how do MiCA requirements in Europe affect the economic viability of AI trading services? What are the capital and licensing implications? The paper also overlooks critical infrastructure economics: the cost structures of decentralized AI compute networks versus centralized alternatives, the tokenomics sustainability of projects like Bittensor, and whether the economic incentives actually align for long-term network security. Finally, the references include several sources that appear to be fabricated or at minimum cannot be verified (e.g., specific SEC release numbers, BIS reports with exact dates), which raises serious concerns about research integrity.",

The methodology section claims to combine 'quantitative analysis of market data, qualitative assessment of technological developments, review of academic literature and industry reports, and expert interviews' but provides no operational details on any of these methods. For expert interviews, we need to know: How many experts? What domains? How were they selected? What questions were asked? How was consensus or disagreement handled? The Delphi method or similar structured approaches are standard in technology forecasting precisely because they provide reproducible, transparent synthesis of expert judgment. The quantitative claims throughout (trading volume percentages, detection rate improvements, participation increases) are presented as facts without any indication of measurement uncertainty, sample characteristics, or data provenance. The vulnerability detection improvement table, for instance, cites a 'DeFi Security Consortium Benchmark Report' that cannot be verified. Legitimate forecasting research would present ranges, confidence levels, and sensitivity analyses. The references include sources dated in the future relative to any actual research timeline, which is epistemologically problematic - these cannot be literature that informed the analysis. The report would benefit enormously from adopting established technology forecasting frameworks such as the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessments, Gartner Hype Cycle positioning, or formal scenario planning with explicit assumptions. Without these methodological foundations, the document remains industry speculation rather than scholarly forecasting research.",

          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From an AI/ML systems perspective, this manuscript exhibits several concerning patterns. First, the treatment of LLM capabilities in financial contexts is overly optimistic. Current LLMs, including frontier models, exhibit well-documented failure modes that are particularly dangerous in financial applications: they hallucinate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, struggle with precise numerical reasoning, and can be manipulated through prompt injection attacks. The report's claim that AI agents manage '$4.2 billion in assets' without discussing the catastrophic risks of LLM-based autonomous financial agents is irresponsible. Second, the smart contract security claims require scrutiny. While AI tools have improved vulnerability detection, the reported detection rates (e.g., 67% for 'logic errors') lack operational definitions. What constitutes a 'logic error'? Against what benchmark? The DeFi Security Consortium report cited does not exist as of my knowledge cutoff, raising concerns about fabricated sources. Third, the discussion of 'Neural Network Consensus' and AI-native blockchain protocols lacks technical depth. How would non-deterministic neural network outputs be reconciled with blockchain consensus requirements? What are the attack surfaces introduced by ML models in consensus? These are fundamental questions that receive no treatment. Fourth, the zkML/verifiable inference discussion glosses over the massive computational overhead that makes current approaches impractical for most real-world applications. Finally, the report should address the fundamental tension between AI systems (which are probabilistic, opaque, and centrally trained) and blockchain systems (which value determinism, transparency, and decentralization). This tension is the core technical challenge of AI-crypto convergence and deserves rigorous analysis rather than optimistic hand-waving.",

The reviewers consistently praise the organizational structure, clarity of presentation, and breadth of coverage.

This is not nitpicking\u2014these are substantive issues that undermine the manuscript's credibility and utility.\n\nThe reviewers are applying appropriate standards. While this may be positioned as an 'industry research report' rather than pure academic research, even industry reports require verifiable data and transparent methodology. The specific claims cited (60-70% AI trading volume, $4.2B in AI-controlled assets, 78% accuracy figures) are presented as facts but lack any reproducible basis. Reviewer 3's point about fabricated future publications (2025-2026 sources) is particularly damaging\u2014this crosses from methodological weakness into credibility concerns. The reviewers are not demanding theoretical novelty; they are demanding basic evidentiary standards.\n\nThat said, this is Round 1 of 3, and the underlying framework has value. The manuscript identifies genuinely important trends at the AI-crypto intersection, provides useful conceptual frameworks, and demonstrates balanced coverage of both opportunities and risks.

      "author_rebuttal": "## Author Rebuttal - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive engagement with our manuscript on AI-crypto convergence. The reviews raise important concerns that we take seriously, and we appreciate the time and expertise invested in providing this feedback.\n\nThe reviewers converge on several critical themes: (1) unverifiable or potentially fabricated sources and quantitative claims, (2) insufficient methodological transparency, (3) overstated AI capabilities without adequate discussion of limitations, and (4) lack of rigorous economic and technical analysis. We acknowledge these are fundamental concerns that require substantial revision rather than superficial corrections. Our revision strategy will prioritize establishing a credible evidentiary foundation, adding explicit uncertainty quantification, incorporating a thorough limitations section, and clearly distinguishing between documented current state and speculative projections. We are committed to transforming this manuscript from what reviewers fairly characterize as \"industry commentary\" into rigorous scholarly research.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Blockchain Economics and Crypto Market Infrastructure)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 1's score of 6.2/10 and their recognition of our comprehensive coverage and clear organizational structure. The concerns about methodological weaknesses, unsubstantiated claims, and insufficient economic analysis are well-founded and will be addressed comprehensively.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Unverifiable quantitative claims (60-70% AI trading volume, $4.2B in AI-controlled assets)**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that these figures lack adequate sourcing and methodology. We acknowledge this is a serious deficiency. Upon review, some cited sources cannot be verified, which is unacceptable for scholarly work.\n   - **Action taken**: We will (a) remove all claims that cannot be traced to verifiable primary sources, (b) add a detailed methodology appendix explaining data collection periods, exchange coverage, and classification criteria for AI-driven trading, (c) where precise figures are unavailable, replace with ranges accompanied by explicit uncertainty bounds and clearly stated assumptions, and (d) conduct a complete audit of all references to remove any fabricated or unverifiable sources.\n\n2. **Insufficient economic analysis of market structure changes**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that our treatment of market microstructure implications is superficial. The reviewer correctly identifies that we failed to analyze market maker economics, liquidity provision sustainability, and adverse selection dynamics.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section (Section 3.2: \"Market Microstructure Implications\") analyzing: (a) the sustainability of reduced spreads given market maker profitability constraints, (b) adverse selection risks for retail participants facing sophisticated AI counterparties, (c) liquidity fragmentation across AI-driven venues with supporting economic models, and (d) MEV redistribution effects on protocol economics with quantitative estimates where data permits.\n\n3. **Inadequate regulatory and compliance cost analysis**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that we inadequately address operational economics of cross-jurisdictional compliance. Our regulatory section was descriptive rather than analytical.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 5 to include: (a) estimated compliance cost structures under MiCA, with analysis of economic viability thresholds for AI trading services, (b) capital and licensing requirements across major jurisdictions with comparative analysis, and (c) discussion of how regulatory costs create barriers to entry and affect market concentration.\n\n4. **Missing infrastructure economics (decentralized compute costs, tokenomics sustainability)**\n   - **Our response**: This is a valid gap. We discussed technical architectures without analyzing their economic viability.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add analysis comparing cost structures of decentralized AI compute networks versus centralized alternatives, and critically examine tokenomics sustainability of cited projects (including Bittensor) with attention to whether economic incentives support long-term network security.\n\n5. **Concerns about fabricated references**\n   - **Our response**: We take this concern extremely seriously. Research integrity is paramount, and any fabricated sources are unacceptable regardless of intent.\n   - **Action taken**: We will conduct a complete reference audit, verify every citation, remove any source that cannot be independently verified, and clearly mark any projections or estimates that derive from our own analysis rather than external sources.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will contextualize the 25% spread reduction claim with analysis of sustainability and market maker profitability implications, and add discussion of gas cost effects on AI agent profitability in DeFi operations.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Technology Forecasting and Survey Methodology)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 2's score of 5.4/10 and their recognition of our organizational structure and balanced treatment of risks. The methodological concerns are fundamental and well-articulated\u2014we agree that the manuscript currently lacks the rigor expected of scholarly forecasting research.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Missing expert interview methodology details**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is entirely correct. We referenced expert interviews without providing essential methodological details (sample size, selection criteria, protocols, synthesis methods). This is a serious omission.\n   - **Action taken**: We will either (a) provide complete methodological documentation including: number of experts (n=X), domain distribution, selection criteria, interview protocol, and aggregation methodology, OR (b) if this documentation cannot be provided to scholarly standards, we will remove claims attributed to expert interviews and reframe relevant sections as literature synthesis and author analysis. We prefer transparency about our actual evidence base over unsupported claims of expert consultation.\n\n2. **Absence of uncertainty quantification**\n   - **Our response**: We fully agree that presenting point estimates without confidence intervals or scenario ranges violates fundamental forecasting practice. This is a significant methodological failure.\n   - **Action taken**: All numerical projections will be revised to include: (a) explicit confidence intervals or ranges where data supports quantification, (b) clear identification of key assumptions underlying each projection, (c) sensitivity analysis showing how projections change under alternative assumptions, and (d) explicit acknowledgment where uncertainty is too high for meaningful quantification.\n\n3. **Epistemologically problematic future-dated references**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that sources dated in the future cannot have informed our analysis. This creates a credibility problem that we must address directly.\n   - **Action taken**: We will (a) remove all unverifiable future-dated sources, (b) clearly distinguish between: documented current state (verifiable sources), expert expectations (with methodology disclosed), and speculative projections (with stated assumptions), and (c) add a \"Limitations and Uncertainty\" subsection to each major section explicitly noting evidence quality.\n\n4. **Lack of established forecasting frameworks**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that adopting established frameworks would strengthen the manuscript's methodological foundation.\n   - **Action taken**: We will incorporate: (a) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessments for key technologies discussed (zkML, AI agents, decentralized compute), (b) explicit scenario planning with best-case, expected, and worst-case trajectories, and (c) a methodology section describing our approach to synthesizing available evidence, with clear acknowledgment of limitations.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will add a table distinguishing evidence quality levels across our claims (verified data, extrapolation, expert consensus, speculation) and include sensitivity analyses for key projections.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (AI/ML Systems and Large Language Models)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 3's score of 5.8/10 and their recognition of our comprehensive coverage and balanced acknowledgment of risks. The technical concerns about AI capability overstatement and insufficient limitations analysis are particularly important and will drive substantial revisions.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Overstated LLM capabilities for autonomous financial decision-making**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer raises crucial points about hallucination, reasoning limitations, context constraints, and adversarial vulnerability that we inadequately addressed. We agree this is a significant gap given the high-stakes nature of financial applications.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section (Section 6.1: \"Fundamental AI/ML Limitations in Financial Contexts\") covering: (a) documented hallucination rates in code generation and financial reasoning tasks, (b) prompt injection and adversarial robustness failures with specific examples, (c) the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment reliability, (d) context window limitations and their implications for complex financial analysis, and (e) the absence of formal verification methods for neural network outputs in safety-critical applications.\n\n2. **Conflation of conceptual possibilities with deployed realities**\n   - **Our response**: This is a fair criticism. Our AI agent architecture discussion did not adequately distinguish between what is technically possible, what has been demonstrated in controlled settings, and what is actually deployed at scale.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise the AI agent discussion to clearly separate: (a) currently deployed systems with verifiable scale and performance data, (b) demonstrated prototypes with documented capabilities and limitations, and (c) conceptual architectures that remain speculative. We will add TRL ratings to each category.\n\n3. **Insufficient treatment of zkML computational overhead**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that we glossed over the massive computational overhead (1000x+ slowdown) that makes current zkML approaches impractical for many applications. This was an oversight that undermines our credibility on technical matters.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise the zkML discussion to include: (a) current computational overhead figures with citations to benchmarking studies, (b) analysis of which applications are feasible versus infeasible given these constraints, (c) realistic timeline estimates for overhead reduction based on current research trajectories, and (d) explicit acknowledgment that many claimed applications remain impractical with current technology.\n\n4. **Unaddressed tension between AI and blockchain system properties**\n   - **Our response**: We agree this is \"the core technical challenge of AI-crypto convergence\" and deserves rigorous analysis. Our failure to address the fundamental tension between probabilistic/opaque AI systems and deterministic/transparent blockchain systems is a significant gap.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section (Section 6.2: \"Fundamental Technical Tensions\") analyzing: (a) how non-deterministic neural network outputs can be reconciled with consensus requirements, (b) attack surfaces introduced by ML models in consensus mechanisms, (c) the transparency/opacity tradeoff and its implications for blockchain's value proposition, and (d) approaches being explored to address these tensions, with honest assessment of their limitations.\n\n5. **Unverifiable sources for smart contract security claims**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge the reviewer's concern about the DeFi Security Consortium report and other potentially unverifiable sources. We cannot defend citations that cannot be independently verified.\n   - **Action taken**: We will remove the specific detection rate table and replace it with: (a) claims grounded in verifiable academic literature on AI-assisted vulnerability detection, (b) explicit acknowledgment of the limited empirical evidence base, and (c) clear operational definitions for vulnerability categories where we retain quantitative claims.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will address the private key security challenge for AI agents explicitly, and add discussion of how LLM-based systems would handle the determinism requirements of blockchain execution.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Revisions Planned:**\n\n1. **Complete reference audit**: Remove all unverifiable or fabricated sources; verify every remaining citation\n2. **New methodology appendix**: Document data collection, classification criteria, and evidence synthesis approach\n3. **New Section 3.2**: \"Market Microstructure Implications\" with economic analysis of AI trading effects\n4. **New Section 6.1**: \"Fundamental AI/ML Limitations in Financial Contexts\"\n5. **New Section 6.2**: \"Fundamental Technical Tensions\" addressing AI-blockchain incompatibilities\n6. **Expanded Section 5**: Regulatory compliance cost analysis with economic viability assessment\n7. **Uncertainty quantification**: Add confidence intervals, scenario ranges, and sensitivity analyses throughout\n8. **TRL assessments**: Add Technology Readiness Level ratings for all major technologies discussed\n9. **Revised zkML discussion**: Include computational overhead analysis and feasibility assessment\n\n**Clarifications Added:**\n\n- Clear distinction between documented current state, expert expectations, and speculative projections\n- Evidence quality indicators for all major claims\n- Explicit assumptions underlying all projections\n- Operational definitions for vulnerability categories and other technical terms\n\n**Structural Changes:**\n\n- Reframe manuscript from industry survey to scholarly analysis with appropriate epistemic humility\n- Add limitations subsections to each major section\n- Include scenario planning with explicit best/expected/worst case trajectories\n\nWe believe these revisions will address the reviewers' substantive concerns and transform the manuscript into rigorous scholarly research.

The TRL framework implementation is particularly well-executed, providing readers with a consistent vocabulary for assessing technological maturity across different application domains. The distinction between documented, emerging, and speculative claims in the methodological appendix is a meaningful structural improvement. However, the revision falls short of fully implementing the promised uncertainty quantification. The rebuttal specifically committed to 'explicit confidence intervals or ranges where data supports quantification' and 'sensitivity analysis showing how projections change under alternative assumptions.' While the manuscript now appropriately acknowledges uncertainty qualitatively, it does not provide the quantitative uncertainty bounds that are standard practice in technology forecasting. For example, the near-term expectations in Section 7.1 could be strengthened by specifying probability ranges or conditional dependencies. Additionally, while the methodology section is improved, it still lacks the systematic documentation expected of a rigorous literature synthesis - the search strategy is described but not documented with reproducible detail. The authors should consider whether a formal Delphi-style expert elicitation, even if conducted post-hoc with a small panel, might strengthen the forecasting credibility. Overall, this revision represents meaningful progress from a score of 5.4 to approximately 7, but achieving publication-ready status would require the quantitative uncertainty framework the authors committed to implementing.",

The methodological appendix and uncertainty framework add needed transparency. However, from a blockchain economics perspective, the revision still falls short of providing the rigorous economic analysis needed to evaluate the viability of AI-crypto convergence. The market microstructure section now acknowledges relevant considerations but remains largely qualitative - we need actual analysis of whether reduced spreads are sustainable given market maker economics, not just acknowledgment that this is a question. The regulatory compliance section lists cost categories but provides no estimates, making it impossible to assess which AI-crypto business models are economically viable under different regulatory regimes. Similarly, the tokenomics discussion correctly identifies sustainability as a concern but doesn't analyze specific mechanisms. The table comparing centralized versus decentralized compute is helpful but needs quantification - what are actual cost differentials? At what scale do decentralized networks become competitive? The fundamental tension table in Section 6.4 is a valuable addition that crystallizes key challenges. Overall, this is now a credible survey paper with appropriate epistemic humility, but it would benefit from deeper economic modeling to move from description to analysis.

The addition of TRL ratings throughout provides useful calibration of technology maturity. The acknowledgment that 'AI systems trained on historical vulnerabilities may be effective at detecting known patterns but provide limited protection against truly novel attacks' is exactly the kind of honest assessment that was missing from the original. However, from an AI/ML systems perspective, I would push for deeper technical engagement in several areas. First, the adversarial robustness discussion needs more specificity\u2014in high-stakes financial contexts, we should expect sophisticated adversaries to probe AI systems systematically. The manuscript should discuss how trading agents might be manipulated through carefully crafted market conditions or how governance AI could be influenced through strategic proposal framing. Second, while the zkML limitations are now appropriately characterized, the manuscript could benefit from discussing alternative approaches to verifiable AI (optimistic verification, TEE-based attestation) with more technical depth on their respective trust assumptions and failure modes. Third, the context window limitation discussion is mentioned but not fully developed\u2014for complex DeFi strategies involving multiple protocols and historical analysis, current context limits are genuinely constraining, and techniques like RAG or fine-tuning have their own limitations in financial contexts. Overall, this revision moves the manuscript from speculative industry commentary toward rigorous analysis, though there remains room for deeper technical engagement with the AI/ML literature on reliability, robustness, and verification.",

      "author_rebuttal": "## Author Rebuttal - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript and their recognition of the substantial improvements made in the first revision. The consistent improvement in scores across all reviewers (from an average of approximately 5.5 to 7.0) validates our revision approach, and we are encouraged by the acknowledgment that the manuscript now demonstrates \"genuine engagement,\" \"intellectual honesty,\" and \"meaningful structural improvement.\"\n\nThe Round 2 feedback converges on three main themes: (1) the need for quantitative uncertainty bounds and systematic documentation that we committed to but did not fully implement, (2) deeper economic analysis of compliance costs, tokenomics sustainability, and market microstructure, and (3) more rigorous technical treatment of adversarial robustness, formal verification limitations, and empirical AI reliability benchmarks. We accept these critiques as valid and actionable. This response outlines specific commitments to address each concern, with the goal of achieving publication-ready status in the next revision.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Technology Forecasting and Survey Methodology)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the recognition that our revision represents \"genuine and substantial progress\" and the improved score of 7.0/10. The reviewer correctly identifies that while we improved qualitative uncertainty acknowledgment, we fell short of implementing the quantitative uncertainty framework we committed to in our Round 1 rebuttal.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Lack of explicit confidence intervals and probability ranges despite rebuttal commitment**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that we did not fully deliver on our promise. We acknowledge this gap and commit to implementing quantitative uncertainty bounds in the next revision. We will adopt a structured approach using calibrated probability ranges for key projections.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 7 to include explicit probability ranges for all major projections. For example: \"We estimate with 65-80% confidence that regulatory frameworks explicitly addressing AI-crypto convergence will be implemented in at least three major jurisdictions (US, EU, and one Asian market) by 2027, conditional on (a) no major AI-related market disruption events and (b) continued legislative momentum following MiCA implementation.\" We will provide similar formulations for technology adoption projections, with clearly stated conditioning assumptions and probability calibration based on reference class forecasting where applicable.\n\n2. **Missing systematic review documentation (PRISMA-style protocol)**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. Our methodology section describes our approach but lacks the reproducible documentation standard for rigorous literature synthesis.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a methodological appendix containing: (a) a PRISMA-style flow diagram showing papers identified, screened, and included; (b) explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria with counts; (c) search date ranges (searches conducted November 2023-February 2024, with targeted updates through May 2024); (d) database sources (IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SSRN, arXiv, Google Scholar) with search strings used. We estimate our final corpus includes approximately 180 sources after screening from an initial pool of approximately 450 identified papers and reports.\n\n3. **Sensitivity analysis mentioned conceptually but not operationalized**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that Section 7.2's \"Scenario Sensitivity\" discussion lacks quantitative rigor.\n   - **Action taken**: We will develop a structured scenario analysis examining how key conclusions vary under three alternative assumption sets: (a) **Accelerated AI Progress**: Assuming 2x faster capability improvement (based on recent scaling law trajectories), we will analyze implications for adoption timelines and centralization pressures; (b) **Restrictive Regulatory Environment**: Assuming MiCA-style frameworks with additional AI-specific requirements globally, we will assess economic viability thresholds; (c) **Major Adverse Event**: Assuming a significant AI-related market manipulation incident, we will examine potential regulatory and adoption trajectory impacts. Each scenario will include specific parameter values and quantified impact on our main conclusions.\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- Regarding the suggestion for Delphi-style expert elicitation: While we agree this would strengthen forecasting credibility, conducting a formal Delphi study is beyond our current scope and timeline. However, we will note this as a valuable direction for future work and will informally validate our probability estimates with three domain experts, documenting their feedback in the supplementary materials.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Blockchain Economics and Crypto Market Infrastructure)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for acknowledging our \"genuine engagement with reviewer feedback\" and the improvement from 6.2 to 7.0. The critique that our economic analysis remains \"descriptive rather than quantitative\" is well-founded, and we commit to adding the rigorous economic modeling the reviewer requests.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Compliance cost analysis remains descriptive without quantitative estimates**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that Section 6.1 identifies cost categories without providing actionable estimates. This limits readers' ability to assess economic viability of different AI-crypto business models.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (6.1.3: \"Economic Viability Analysis\") providing order-of-magnitude compliance cost estimates under different regulatory frameworks. Drawing on publicly available information from MiCA implementation guidance, SEC registration requirements, and industry surveys (e.g., Chainalysis compliance cost reports), we will estimate: (a) Initial licensing costs: \u20ac50,000-\u20ac500,000 depending on service category and jurisdiction; (b) Ongoing compliance infrastructure: \u20ac200,000-\u20ac2M annually for mid-sized operations; (c) Legal and technical staffing: 3-8 FTEs for compliant AI-crypto services. We will then analyze minimum viable scale thresholds, estimating that compliant AI trading operations likely require minimum AUM of $50-100M to achieve economic sustainability under current regulatory frameworks\u2014a finding with significant implications for market structure and centralization.\n\n2. **Tokenomics sustainability discussion lacks rigorous economic modeling**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we raise sustainability concerns without analyzing specific mechanisms.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a detailed case study of Bittensor (TAO) tokenomics in Section 5.1, examining: (a) Token emission schedule (approximately 7,200 TAO daily at current rates, declining over time); (b) Demand drivers (validator staking requirements, subnet registration costs, speculative demand); (c) Sustainability conditions\u2014we will model the equilibrium where emission value equals network utility value, identifying the network usage levels required to avoid perpetual subsidization. Our preliminary analysis suggests current decentralized AI networks require 5-10x usage growth to achieve tokenomic sustainability without relying primarily on speculative demand.\n\n3. **Capital requirements and barriers to entry not quantified**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that claims about centralization pressures require substantiation through capital requirement analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add order-of-magnitude estimates for competitive AI trading infrastructure: (a) Compute infrastructure: $500K-$5M annually for competitive model training and inference; (b) Data acquisition: $100K-$1M annually for premium market data feeds; (c) Talent: $1-3M annually for a minimal competitive team (ML engineers, quant researchers, infrastructure); (d) Risk capital: $10-50M minimum for meaningful market participation with appropriate risk management. Total barrier to entry: approximately $15-60M, supporting our thesis about centralization pressures and explaining why AI trading capabilities concentrate among well-capitalized entities.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- On the centralized vs. decentralized compute cost differential: We will add specific cost comparisons based on publicly available pricing (AWS/GCP vs. Akash/Render network pricing) with break-even analysis at different utilization levels. Preliminary data suggests decentralized networks offer 30-60% cost savings for batch inference workloads but remain uncompetitive for latency-sensitive training due to coordination overhead.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (AI/ML Systems and Large Language Models)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We are grateful for the recognition that our revision \"moves the manuscript from speculative industry commentary toward rigorous analysis\" and appreciate the improved score of 7.0/10. The requests for deeper technical engagement with adversarial robustness, empirical reliability benchmarks, and formal verification limitations are well-taken.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Adversarial robustness treatment remains superficial, lacking specific attack vector analysis**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that our discussion of adversarial risks lacks the specificity needed for a technical audience. We will substantially expand this analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (4.4: \"Adversarial Attack Surfaces in AI-Crypto Systems\") addressing: (a) **Prompt injection in trading agents**: Following Greshake et al. (2023), we will analyze how indirect prompt injection through manipulated market data feeds, social media sentiment, or on-chain metadata could cause AI agents to execute unintended trades. We will discuss specific scenarios where adversaries embed malicious instructions in token metadata or governance proposal text; (b) **Model extraction attacks**: We will discuss how repeated querying of AI-driven DeFi protocols could enable model stealing, with implications for proprietary trading strategies; (c) **Adversarial market conditions**: We will analyze how sophisticated actors might craft market microstructure conditions (specific order book patterns, liquidity distributions) designed to trigger predictable AI agent responses, enabling front-running or manipulation.\n\n2. **Hallucination discussion lacks quantitative grounding from peer-reviewed benchmarks**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that our reliability discussion would benefit from empirical anchoring.\n   - **Action taken**: We will incorporate specific benchmark data: (a) HumanEval pass@1 rates for code generation (GPT-4: ~67%, indicating 1-in-3 failure rate on relatively simple coding tasks); (b) CodeXGLUE benchmark performance showing significant degradation on complex, multi-step code generation; (c) Recent work on smart contract-specific benchmarks showing even lower reliability for Solidity generation (estimated 40-50% functional correctness on simple contracts based on available evaluations). We will explicitly connect these benchmarks to our claims about smart contract generation limitations, noting that current reliability levels are incompatible with autonomous deployment without human review.\n\n3. **Formal verification limitations not adequately addressed**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer raises a fundamental point about the gap between neural network outputs and formal guarantees that we have not adequately explored.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 4.2 to discuss: (a) The fundamental impossibility of formally verifying arbitrary neural network outputs (Rice's theorem implications for semantic properties); (b) The distinction between verifying that *a specific model produced an output* (achievable via zkML) versus verifying that *the output is correct* (generally undecidable); (c) Alternative approaches with explicit trust assumption analysis: optimistic verification (fraud proofs with challenge periods, trusting that at least one honest verifier exists), TEE-based attestation (trusting hardware manufacturers and their supply chains), and cryptographic commitments (trusting the underlying cryptographic assumptions). We will note that all current approaches to \"trustless AI\" actually shift rather than eliminate trust assumptions.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- On context window limitations: We will expand the discussion to note that while context windows have grown substantially (128K+ tokens in current models), complex DeFi strategy analysis involving multiple protocols, historical data, and risk assessment can easily exceed these limits. We will discuss RAG limitations in financial contexts (retrieval relevance challenges, potential for adversarial document injection) and fine-tuning limitations (catastrophic forgetting, difficulty incorporating rapidly changing market conditions).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Quantitative Uncertainty Framework (Addressing Reviewer 1)**:\n- Add explicit probability ranges (e.g., 65-80% confidence) with conditioning assumptions for all major projections in Section 7\n- Include PRISMA-style systematic review documentation in methodological appendix\n- Develop three-scenario quantitative sensitivity analysis with specific parameter variations\n\n**Economic Analysis Deepening (Addressing Reviewer 2)**:\n- Add compliance cost estimates with minimum viable scale analysis (new Section 6.1.3)\n- Include Bittensor tokenomics case study with sustainability modeling (expanded Section 5.1)\n- Provide order-of-magnitude capital requirement estimates for competitive AI trading operations\n- Add centralized vs. decentralized compute cost comparison with break-even analysis\n\n**Technical Rigor Enhancement (Addressing Reviewer 3)**:\n- New subsection on adversarial attack surfaces including prompt injection, model extraction, and adversarial market conditions (Section 4.4)\n- Incorporate HumanEval, CodeXGLUE, and smart contract-specific benchmark data for hallucination discussion\n- Expand formal verification limitations discussion with analysis of fundamental impossibility results and trust assumption mapping for alternative approaches\n- Enhanced context window and RAG limitations discussion\n\n**Cross-Cutting Improvements**:\n- Ensure all new quantitative claims are properly sourced or explicitly marked as author estimates with methodology disclosed\n- Maintain consistency with established TRL framework and three-tier evidence categorization\n- Update methodological appendix to reflect all analytical additions\n\nWe believe these revisions will address the remaining gaps identified by all three reviewers and bring the manuscript to publication-ready status. We are grateful for the constructive engagement that has substantially strengthened this work.",

The three specific suggestions I provided have been meaningfully addressed: (1) explicit probability ranges now appear throughout Section 7 with conditioning assumptions clearly stated; (2) the methodological appendix includes a search protocol summary with quantified screening results; and (3) the scenario analysis in Section 7.2 includes a sensitivity analysis table showing parameter variations and their impacts. The confidence framework (High 70-90%, Moderate 40-70%, Low 20-40%) provides useful structure for interpreting projections. However, from a forecasting methodology standpoint, the manuscript would benefit from greater transparency about how these probability estimates were derived. Best practices in technology forecasting (following work by Tetlock on superforecasting and the Good Judgment Project) emphasize the importance of identifying reference classes and base rates. The manuscript mentions 'reference class forecasting where applicable' but doesn't operationalize this. Similarly, while the four-scenario framework is well-structured, the probability assignments appear as assertions rather than derived estimates. A brief methodological note explaining whether these represent author judgment, analogy to historical cases, or some structured process would strengthen the forecasting credibility. The systematic review documentation is much improved but could be strengthened by reporting inter-rater reliability (if multiple reviewers screened papers) and quantifying the peer-reviewed versus preprint composition of the final corpus. Despite these remaining gaps, the manuscript now meets a reasonable standard for technology forecasting rigor and represents a significant improvement from the previous version.",

The compliance cost framework in Section 6.1 is particularly valuable\u2014the breakdown by category and the derived minimum viable scale thresholds provide actionable guidance for practitioners assessing economic viability of AI-crypto services. The acknowledgment that these costs may drive consolidation and create barriers to entry represents honest engagement with the tension between regulatory compliance and decentralization goals. The capital requirements analysis for AI trading operations is well-structured and the $7M-$60M+ estimate is plausible given the component costs outlined. This directly supports the manuscript's thesis about centralization pressures in a way the previous version did not. The Bittensor case study addresses my request for tokenomics analysis, and I appreciate the authors' appropriate skepticism about sustainability, drawing parallels to Filecoin and Helium's challenges. However, the analysis remains somewhat narrative rather than formal\u2014a simple equilibrium condition (e.g., 'sustainability requires fee revenue \u2265 emission_rate \u00d7 token_price') with back-of-envelope calculations would strengthen this section. The comparison of centralized vs. decentralized compute costs is useful but would benefit from explicit sourcing. Overall, this revision moves the economic analysis from descriptive to analytical, and the manuscript now provides a credible framework for understanding the economic dynamics of AI-crypto convergence.

The new Section 4.4 on adversarial attack surfaces is particularly well-executed, providing concrete attack vectors (prompt injection through token metadata, model extraction through repeated queries, adversarial market microstructure) that will be valuable for practitioners. The treatment of formal verification now correctly articulates the fundamental impossibility results and maps trust assumptions across different verification approaches\u2014this is technically accurate and important for readers to understand. The benchmark integration is helpful, though I note that the field moves quickly and some of these numbers may already be outdated. The manuscript now appropriately positions AI capabilities as augmentative rather than transformative for security-critical applications, which reflects the current technical reality. One area that could still be strengthened is the treatment of emergent attack vectors\u2014as AI agents become more prevalent in DeFi, we should expect adversaries to develop increasingly sophisticated techniques for exploiting them. The economic incentives in crypto markets make this a particularly adversarial environment compared to typical AI deployment contexts. Overall, this revision moves the manuscript to a level of technical rigor appropriate for publication, with the caveats noted above representing opportunities for further strengthening rather than fundamental gaps.",

Reviewer 1's concerns about probability calibration methodology and inter-rater reliability are valid methodological points, but they represent enhancements to an already functional framework rather than fatal gaps. Reviewer 2's requests for additional citations and formal tokenomics modeling would strengthen the work but do not undermine the existing economic analysis. Reviewer 3's suggestions about newer benchmarks and expanded RAG vulnerability discussion are forward-looking improvements rather than corrections of errors.
