      "summary": "The revised manuscript demonstrates substantial improvement in addressing my previous concerns about quantitative uncertainty frameworks and systematic review documentation. The authors have implemented explicit probability ranges for projections, added a PRISMA-style search protocol summary, and developed a structured scenario analysis framework. This revision moves the manuscript to near publication-ready status from a technology forecasting methodology perspective.",
      "strengths": [
        "Explicit confidence intervals now accompany major projections (e.g., '70-85% probability, conditional on no major regulatory disruptions') with clearly stated conditioning assumptions, directly addressing my primary Round 2 concern",
        "The methodological appendix now includes systematic review documentation with search protocol details (847 papers identified, 89 included after screening), inclusion/exclusion criteria counts, and database sources\u2014a significant improvement in reproducibility",
        "The four-scenario analysis framework (Sections 7.1-7.2) with explicit probability assignments and sensitivity analysis table showing how conclusions vary under alternative assumptions represents genuine operationalization of scenario methodology"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "While probability ranges are now provided, the calibration methodology remains underspecified\u2014the manuscript states confidence levels are based on 'reference class forecasting where applicable' but does not identify specific reference classes or base rates used for calibration",
        "The systematic review protocol summary, while improved, lacks some standard elements: inter-rater reliability for screening decisions is not reported, and the distinction between peer-reviewed and preprint sources in the final corpus is not quantified",
        "The scenario probability assignments (40%, 25%, 20%, 15%) sum to 100% but the methodology for deriving these specific values is not explained\u2014are these author judgments, derived from historical analogies, or based on some structured elicitation process?"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a brief subsection explaining the probability calibration approach: identify 2-3 reference classes used (e.g., historical technology adoption rates, regulatory timeline precedents) and show how base rates informed the confidence intervals",
        "Report the proportion of peer-reviewed versus preprint sources in the final corpus (89 papers) and note whether any validation process was applied to preprint findings (e.g., citation counts, subsequent publication)",
        "Include a brief methodological note on scenario probability derivation\u2014even acknowledging these as 'structured author judgments informed by [specific factors]' would improve transparency over presenting them as given"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "This revision represents genuine and substantial engagement with my Round 2 feedback. The three specific suggestions I provided have been meaningfully addressed: (1) explicit probability ranges now appear throughout Section 7 with conditioning assumptions clearly stated; (2) the methodological appendix includes a search protocol summary with quantified screening results; and (3) the scenario analysis in Section 7.2 includes a sensitivity analysis table showing parameter variations and their impacts. The confidence framework (High 70-90%, Moderate 40-70%, Low 20-40%) provides useful structure for interpreting projections. However, from a forecasting methodology standpoint, the manuscript would benefit from greater transparency about how these probability estimates were derived. Best practices in technology forecasting (following work by Tetlock on superforecasting and the Good Judgment Project) emphasize the importance of identifying reference classes and base rates. The manuscript mentions 'reference class forecasting where applicable' but doesn't operationalize this. Similarly, while the four-scenario framework is well-structured, the probability assignments appear as assertions rather than derived estimates. A brief methodological note explaining whether these represent author judgment, analogy to historical cases, or some structured process would strengthen the forecasting credibility. The systematic review documentation is much improved but could be strengthened by reporting inter-rater reliability (if multiple reviewers screened papers) and quantifying the peer-reviewed versus preprint composition of the final corpus. Despite these remaining gaps, the manuscript now meets a reasonable standard for technology forecasting rigor and represents a significant improvement from the previous version.",

        "The decentralized vs. centralized compute cost comparison table provides useful ranges but lacks citation to specific pricing data sources (Akash, Render network pricing) that would allow readers to verify or update these estimates",

        "Market maker sustainability analysis in Section 2.2 remains somewhat qualitative; the table of factors affecting market makers would be strengthened by incorporating empirical data on LP profitability trends from the cited Dune Analytics dashboards"

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "The authors have genuinely engaged with my feedback and delivered meaningful improvements to the economic analysis throughout the manuscript. The compliance cost framework in Section 6.1 is particularly valuable\u2014the breakdown by category and the derived minimum viable scale thresholds provide actionable guidance for practitioners assessing economic viability of AI-crypto services. The acknowledgment that these costs may drive consolidation and create barriers to entry represents honest engagement with the tension between regulatory compliance and decentralization goals. The capital requirements analysis for AI trading operations is well-structured and the $7M-$60M+ estimate is plausible given the component costs outlined. This directly supports the manuscript's thesis about centralization pressures in a way the previous version did not. The Bittensor case study addresses my request for tokenomics analysis, and I appreciate the authors' appropriate skepticism about sustainability, drawing parallels to Filecoin and Helium's challenges. However, the analysis remains somewhat narrative rather than formal\u2014a simple equilibrium condition (e.g., 'sustainability requires fee revenue \u2265 emission_rate \u00d7 token_price') with back-of-envelope calculations would strengthen this section. The comparison of centralized vs. decentralized compute costs is useful but would benefit from explicit sourcing. Overall, this revision moves the economic analysis from descriptive to analytical, and the manuscript now provides a credible framework for understanding the economic dynamics of AI-crypto convergence. The remaining weaknesses are relatively minor and do not prevent publication.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The adversarial robustness discussion, while much improved, could benefit from discussion of more recent jailbreaking techniques (e.g., Zou et al. 2023 is cited but not deeply analyzed) and how these might manifest in financial agent contexts where adversaries have strong economic incentives",
        "The benchmark data, while helpful, relies primarily on HumanEval and CodeXGLUE which are now somewhat dated; more recent evaluations (e.g., SWE-bench for real-world software engineering tasks, or emerging smart contract-specific benchmarks) would strengthen the reliability analysis",
        "The discussion of context window limitations and RAG vulnerabilities in Section 2.3 is present but could be expanded\u2014specifically, adversarial document injection in RAG systems for financial agents represents a significant attack surface that deserves more technical detail"

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "This revision represents a substantial and genuine engagement with my previous feedback. The authors have delivered on their commitments regarding adversarial robustness, benchmark integration, and formal verification limitations. The new Section 4.4 on adversarial attack surfaces is particularly well-executed, providing concrete attack vectors (prompt injection through token metadata, model extraction through repeated queries, adversarial market microstructure) that will be valuable for practitioners. The treatment of formal verification now correctly articulates the fundamental impossibility results and maps trust assumptions across different verification approaches\u2014this is technically accurate and important for readers to understand. The benchmark integration is helpful, though I note that the field moves quickly and some of these numbers may already be outdated. The manuscript now appropriately positions AI capabilities as augmentative rather than transformative for security-critical applications, which reflects the current technical reality. One area that could still be strengthened is the treatment of emergent attack vectors\u2014as AI agents become more prevalent in DeFi, we should expect adversaries to develop increasingly sophisticated techniques for exploiting them. The economic incentives in crypto markets make this a particularly adversarial environment compared to typical AI deployment contexts. Overall, this revision moves the manuscript to a level of technical rigor appropriate for publication, with the caveats noted above representing opportunities for further strengthening rather than fundamental gaps.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript has demonstrated exceptional improvement across three revision rounds, moving from a score of 5.8 to 7.9\u2014a trajectory that reflects genuine author engagement with substantive feedback. All three reviewers now converge on scores of 7.8-8.0, indicating the manuscript has reached a consistent quality threshold. The authors have systematically addressed the major concerns raised in earlier rounds: implementing quantitative uncertainty frameworks with explicit probability ranges, adding systematic review documentation, developing compliance cost analyses, and substantially strengthening the adversarial robustness treatment. This is precisely the kind of responsive revision process that merits editorial recognition.\n\nCritically, the remaining weaknesses identified by reviewers are refinements rather than fundamental flaws. Reviewer 1's concerns about probability calibration methodology and inter-rater reliability are valid methodological points, but they represent enhancements to an already functional framework rather than fatal gaps. Reviewer 2's requests for additional citations and formal tokenomics modeling would strengthen the work but do not undermine the existing economic analysis. Reviewer 3's suggestions about newer benchmarks and expanded RAG vulnerability discussion are forward-looking improvements rather than corrections of errors. None of these issues call into question the manuscript's core contributions or reliability.\n\nAs an editorial matter, this is Round 3 of 3, and we have reached the point of diminishing returns on revision cycles. The manuscript now provides valuable, actionable analysis of AI-crypto convergence with appropriate methodological rigor for an industry research report. The reviewers are applying standards appropriate to the venue\u2014they are not demanding pure theoretical novelty but rather methodological transparency and empirical grounding, which the authors have substantially delivered. Continuing to iterate on increasingly marginal improvements would delay publication of work that is ready to contribute to the field.",
