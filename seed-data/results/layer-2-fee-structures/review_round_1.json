      "summary": "This report provides a comprehensive descriptive overview of L2 fee structures with useful practical data, but lacks the economic rigor expected for mechanism design analysis. While the cost comparisons and case studies are valuable, the report misses critical economic analysis of incentive alignment, market dynamics, fee market efficiency, and game-theoretic considerations that would elevate it from a survey to actionable research.",
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent empirical data collection with specific cost breakdowns across multiple L2s, providing quantitative baselines for comparison (e.g., Base's 86.1% priority fee revenue, detailed fee component analysis)",
        "Strong practical framework with decision matrices and case studies that translate technical differences into actionable guidance for users and developers",
        "Clear identification of market concentration dynamics (90% on top 3 L2s) and sustainability concerns around subsidized models, particularly ZK rollup proof generation costs"

      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient economic mechanism analysis: No examination of sequencer auction dynamics, MEV capture/redistribution, priority fee market efficiency, or game-theoretic equilibria in fee setting. The report describes what fees are but not why they emerge or whether they're economically optimal",
        "Missing critical incentive alignment analysis: How do current fee structures align (or misalign) sequencer, user, and protocol incentives? What are the principal-agent problems? Why is Base profitable while others aren't\u2014is it operational efficiency or rent extraction? No analysis of whether 86.1% priority fee capture is efficient or extractive",
        "Lacks quantitative economic modeling: No elasticity analysis (how do transaction volumes respond to fee changes?), no welfare analysis (consumer/producer surplus), no examination of fee market clearing mechanisms, and no discussion of optimal fee structures given different objectives (revenue maximization vs. usage maximization vs. decentralization)"

        "Add game-theoretic analysis of sequencer competition and fee setting: Model the Nash equilibrium in the current centralized sequencer regime vs. shared sequencing scenarios.

Model optimal fee curves that balance sequencer sustainability with user adoption\u2014this is critical for Tokamak's positioning",
        "Analyze MEV and priority fee markets more rigorously: Base's 86.1% priority fee revenue suggests significant MEV capture. Examine whether this represents efficient price discovery or market failure. Compare priority fee auction mechanisms across L2s and their efficiency properties. Discuss implications for user welfare and protocol sustainability"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain economics perspective, this report excels at descriptive analysis but falls short on mechanism design rigor. The empirical data is valuable\u2014knowing that Base captures 86.1% of revenue from priority fees is important\u2014but the report doesn't analyze *why* this occurs or whether it's economically efficient. Is this competitive pricing reflecting true user willingness-to-pay for transaction ordering, or is it rent extraction enabled by sequencer monopoly power? The lack of game-theoretic modeling is a significant gap.\n\nThe fee structure breakdowns (e.g., Base's $0.064 swap = 7.8% execution + 70.3% DA + 21.9% margin) are useful, but there's no analysis of whether these margins are sustainable, competitive, or optimal. A 21.9% margin could indicate healthy profitability or monopolistic pricing\u2014without elasticity analysis or comparison to competitive benchmarks, we can't assess efficiency. The report notes Base is the only profitable L2 but doesn't rigorously examine whether this reflects superior operational efficiency, better fee mechanism design, or simply more aggressive rent extraction from a captive user base.\n\nThe treatment of subsidies in ZK rollups (StarkNet's $0.002 fees) correctly identifies unsustainability but lacks economic modeling of what happens when subsidies end. Will demand collapse? What's the price elasticity? How will users substitute between L2s? These are critical questions for understanding market dynamics and competitive positioning. The report would benefit from modeling different subsidy removal scenarios and their equilibrium effects.\n\nThe discussion of based rollups and shared sequencing touches on important decentralization-efficiency tradeoffs but lacks formal analysis. What are the mechanism design properties of L1-sequenced ordering vs. centralized sequencers? How do they differ in terms of MEV extraction, censorship resistance, and latency? The report mentions Taiko brings \"more revenue back to Ethereum\" but doesn't quantify this or analyze the economic implications for L2 sustainability.\n\nFor Tokamak Network positioning, the recommendations are reasonable but not grounded in rigorous economic analysis. \"Focus on fee predictability\" is good advice, but *why* do users value predictability? Is it risk aversion? Planning costs? What's the willingness-to-pay for reduced variance? Similarly, \"benchmark against Base\" is suggested, but without understanding Base's economic model deeply (is their profitability sustainable? replicable? optimal?), this guidance is superficial.\n\nThe report would be significantly strengthened by: (1) modeling sequencer competition as a dynamic game with entry/exit decisions, (2) analyzing fee market efficiency using auction theory and mechanism design principles, (3) quantifying elasticities and welfare effects of different fee structures, (4) examining MEV markets and their interaction with priority fees, and (5) developing formal models of optimal fee structures given different protocol objectives. These additions would transform this from a descriptive survey into actionable economic research that could guide Tokamak's mechanism design decisions.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic perspective, this manuscript suffers from treating cryptographic proof systems as black boxes with economic inputs/outputs, missing the fundamental insight that fee structures are *consequences* of cryptographic design choices, not independent variables. The most problematic section is 2.2 on ZK rollups, which states 'Generate cryptographic proofs (SNARKs or STARKs) that mathematically verify transaction correctness' without explaining that SNARKs and STARKs have fundamentally different security models: SNARKs typically require trusted setups (ceremony-generated toxic waste) and rely on pairing-based cryptography with discrete log assumptions, while STARKs use transparent setups with collision-resistant hash functions and are post-quantum secure. This distinction directly impacts decentralization (trusted setup is a centralization vector), long-term security (quantum threats), and computational costs (pairing operations vs. hash evaluations). The claim that 'proof generation is computationally intensive' needs quantification: a Groth16 SNARK proof for a circuit with 10^6 constraints requires ~10^8 group operations and ~1GB RAM, while STARK proving scales quasi-linearly but with larger constant factors. The manuscript states proof verification costs '300,000-500,000 gas' without explaining this is primarily pairing operations (2 pairings for Groth16) or FRI verification queries, and that this fixed cost is why batching is cryptographically necessary, not just economically beneficial. The treatment of 'state diffs' in ZK rollups is cryptographically incomplete: ZK rollups can post only state changes because they use cryptographic commitments (Merkle roots or polynomial commitments) to the full state, and the validity proof demonstrates that the new commitment correctly reflects the state transitions\u2014this is a profound cryptographic insight that enables compression, not just an implementation detail. The fraud proof mechanism in optimistic rollups is similarly underspecified: fraud proofs require interactive verification games (bisection protocols) with specific cryptographic properties (Merkle proofs of execution traces), and the 7-day challenge period is not arbitrary but must be long enough for verifiers to download data, recompute state transitions, and submit proofs on-chain\u2014this is a cryptographic-economic security parameter. The manuscript would benefit from a formal security model section that defines adversarial capabilities (malicious sequencer, malicious prover, data withholding attacks), security goals (soundness, completeness, data availability), and how different cryptographic constructions achieve these goals under specific assumptions. Without this foundation, the economic analysis floats disconnected from the cryptographic reality that determines what is possible and at what cost.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems perspective, this manuscript reads more as a market survey than rigorous technical research. The fundamental issue is that rollups are presented primarily through their economic properties rather than their distributed systems characteristics. For example, the optimistic vs ZK rollup comparison focuses on cost components but doesn't analyze the profound differences in their consensus mechanisms: optimistic rollups rely on economic incentives and challenge periods (a form of eventual consistency with probabilistic finality), while ZK rollups provide cryptographic finality through validity proofs (deterministic consistency). These represent fundamentally different approaches to the consensus problem in distributed systems.\n\nThe treatment of sequencers is particularly weak from a systems architecture standpoint. All major L2s use centralized sequencers, which represents a critical single point of failure and censorship vector - yet this is mentioned only briefly in the 'future trends' section. A rigorous analysis would examine: (1) the CAP theorem implications of centralized sequencing (trading partition tolerance for consistency/availability), (2) failure modes and recovery mechanisms when sequencers go offline, (3) the trust assumptions users must make about sequencer honesty, and (4) formal models of decentralized sequencer networks as Byzantine consensus protocols.\n\nThe performance analysis is entirely empirical without theoretical grounding. Citing that 'zkSync Era achieves 12-15 TPS' is useful, but where's the analysis of why? What are the bottlenecks - proof generation latency, network bandwidth, state growth, or L1 data posting limits? A proper distributed systems analysis would model these systems using queuing theory, analyze throughput-latency trade-offs, and provide theoretical capacity bounds. The claim that 'blob space is not the bottleneck' needs rigorous justification through capacity planning analysis, not just observation that current utilization is low.\n\nThe fraud proof mechanism in optimistic rollups deserves much deeper treatment. The 7-day challenge period is a critical distributed consensus parameter that balances security (time for validators to detect and prove fraud) against user experience (withdrawal delays). This should be analyzed as a challenge-response protocol with game-theoretic modeling: What are the costs for challengers vs. fraudulent sequencers? What griefing attacks are possible? How does the bond mechanism ensure rational behavior? The report mentions this is relevant to 'challenge-based protocols' for Tokamak's research, but provides no formal analysis.\n\nThe EIP-4844 analysis, while thorough on cost impacts, misses important distributed systems implications. Blob space introduces a new data availability layer with different persistence guarantees than calldata (blobs are pruned after ~18 days). This affects the trust model - who stores historical data for fraud proofs? How does this impact the security assumptions of optimistic rollups? The report should analyze data availability sampling protocols and their network efficiency.\n\nCross-L2 communication is mentioned but not analyzed as a distributed systems problem. Atomic composability across rollups requires solving distributed transaction protocols (two-phase commit or similar), which introduces significant complexity and latency. The claim that 'multi-hop transactions cost 5\u00d7-10\u00d7 more' needs breakdown: how much is due to multiple L1 postings vs. coordination overhead vs. liquidity fragmentation?\n\nFor a research document targeting PhD-level work on distributed protocols, I would expect: formal security definitions, complexity analysis (computational and communication), proofs of safety/liveness properties, performance modeling with theoretical bounds, and rigorous comparison of architectural trade-offs. The current manuscript provides valuable empirical data and market insights but lacks the theoretical foundation and analytical rigor expected in distributed systems research. It would benefit from collaboration with researchers who can provide formal modeling, protocol analysis, and systems architecture evaluation to complement the strong empirical work.",
