## Author Response - Round 1

### Overview

We sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback. We appreciate the time and expertise invested in evaluating our manuscript. The reviews identify consistent themes that we take seriously: (1) severe citation deficiencies throughout, particularly for foundational utilitarian texts; (2) insufficient technical rigor in engaging with specialized debates in welfare economics, moral psychology, and distributive justice; (3) lack of clear original contribution beyond synthetic survey; and (4) uneven integration of contemporary sources, particularly environmental ethics literature.

We acknowledge these are serious weaknesses that compromise the manuscript's scholarly integrity and contribution. In this revision, we will: (1) add comprehensive citations for all classical and contemporary sources; (2) substantially deepen technical analysis in key areas (welfare economics, distributive justice, moral psychology); (3) develop a clearer argumentative thesis rather than purely descriptive survey; (4) strengthen engagement with effective altruism and institutional design literature; and (5) either more rigorously connect environmental ethics sources to utilitarian theory or reduce their prominence. We anticipate these revisions will increase the manuscript length by approximately 2,000-3,000 words to accommodate the necessary depth while maintaining accessibility for our intermediate audience.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Moral Philosophy and Ethics)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate this reviewer's recognition of our comprehensive scope and clear structure while acknowledging the serious deficiencies in citation practices and technical rigor (Average: 5.5/10). The reviewer correctly identifies that our manuscript is primarily synthetic rather than advancing novel arguments—a fundamental weakness we will address.

**Major Points**:

1. **Citation deficiencies for foundational utilitarian texts**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The extensive '[citation needed]' markers throughout foundational discussions are unacceptable for scholarly work. This represents a serious oversight in manuscript preparation that we will completely rectify.
   - **Action taken**: We will add comprehensive citations including:
     - Bentham, J. (1789). *An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation*
     - Mill, J.S. (1861). *Utilitarianism*
     - Sidgwick, H. (1874/1907). *The Methods of Ethics*
     - Nozick, R. (1974). *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (experience machine)
     - Rawls, J. (1971). *A Theory of Justice* (separateness of persons)
     - Williams, B. (1973). "A Critique of Utilitarianism" in *Utilitarianism: For and Against*
     - Arrow, K. (1951). *Social Choice and Individual Values*
     - Hare, R.M. (1981). *Moral Thinking*
     - Singer, P. (1979). *Practical Ethics*; (1981). *The Expanding Circle*
   
   We will also add proper citations for all secondary literature discussed. This is our highest priority revision.

2. **Limited technical rigor in consequentialist debates**
   - **Our response**: We agree that our treatment lacks engagement with important technical distinctions. The reviewer's specific suggestions (scalar vs. maximizing consequentialism, satisficing variants, threshold deontology) identify crucial gaps.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (approximately 800-1000 words) titled "Varieties of Consequentialism" that engages with:
     - Norcross, A. (2006). "Reasons without Demands: Rethinking Rightness" on scalar consequentialism
     - Slote, M. (1984). "Satisficing Consequentialism" and the debate over optimizing vs. satisficing requirements
     - Scheffler, S. (1982). *The Rejection of Consequentialism* on agent-centered prerogatives
     - Portmore, D. (2011). *Commonsense Consequentialism* on threshold deontology
   
   This will provide the technical precision currently lacking and demonstrate engagement with specialized debates.

3. **Insufficient engagement with moral psychology literature**
   - **Our response**: This is a particularly important gap given our stated expertise area. The reviewer correctly notes minimal engagement with empirical literature on altruistic motivation and psychological feasibility.
   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand the moral psychology section (currently underdeveloped) with approximately 1,000 words engaging:
     - Greene, J. (2013). *Moral Tribes* on dual-process theory and utilitarian judgment
     - Haidt, J. (2012). *The Righteous Mind* on moral foundations and utilitarian reasoning
     - Bloom, P. (2013). *Just Babies* on developmental origins of moral judgment
     - Batson, C.D. (2011). *Altruism in Humans* on empathy-altruism hypothesis
     - Kahane, G. et al. (2018). "Beyond Sacrificial Harm" on psychological profiles of utilitarian responders
   
   This will ground theoretical discussions in empirical findings about moral cognition and altruistic motivation.

4. **Superficial welfare economics treatment**
   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our discussion lacks engagement with social welfare functions, formal aggregation problems, and the Harsanyi-Rawls debate. This is essential for rigorous treatment of utilitarian foundations.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (approximately 700-900 words) titled "Formal Foundations in Welfare Economics" covering:
     - Harsanyi, J. (1955). "Cardinal Welfare, Individualistic Ethics, and Interpersonal Comparisons of Utility"
     - Sen, A. (1970). *Collective Choice and Social Welfare* on aggregation and interpersonal comparisons
     - The Harsanyi-Rawls debate on utilitarianism vs. maximin under uncertainty
     - Social welfare functions and their axiomatic foundations
     - Pareto principles and their relationship to utilitarian aggregation
   
   This will provide the technical rigor currently absent.

5. **Value pluralism analysis needs more precision**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that while we identify tensions between value pluralism and utilitarian commensurability, we don't rigorously examine whether utilitarian frameworks can accommodate incommensurability. We will develop this more carefully.
   - **Action taken**: We will revise the value pluralism section to engage with:
     - Chang, R. (2002). "The Possibility of Parity" on incommensurability
     - Anderson, E. (1993). *Value in Ethics and Economics* on plural value spheres
     - Whether utilitarian frameworks can accommodate lexical orderings (Rawls), rough equality (Griffin), or incomparability (Raz)
     - The distinction between value pluralism as external critique vs. internal expansion of utilitarian frameworks (Norton's convergence hypothesis in environmental ethics)

6. **Practical applications need more rigorous normative analysis**
   - **Our response**: We agree that healthcare and environmental sections describe tensions without sufficient theoretical depth. The reviewer's specific suggestions about QALYs/DALYs debate and discounting are well-taken.
   - **Action taken**: 
     - Healthcare section: Add engagement with Nord, E. (1999). *Cost-Value Analysis in Health Care*; Dolan, P. (1998) on QALY measurement; Brock, D. (2004) on disability discrimination concerns; philosophical foundations of cost-effectiveness analysis
     - Environmental section: Add rigorous analysis of discounting debates (Stern vs. Nordhaus), formal structure of intergenerational welfare functions, and Broome's work on climate ethics

**Minor Points**: 
We will address the reviewer's suggestion to consider narrowing scope for deeper analysis. However, we believe the comprehensive scope serves our intermediate audience well. Instead of narrowing, we will sharpen the argumentative focus (see Summary of Changes) while maintaining breadth. We will ensure all descriptive sections now include critical analysis and engage with debates rather than merely surveying positions.

### Response to Reviewer 2 (History of Utilitarian Thought)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate this reviewer's recognition of our clear structure and accessibility while taking very seriously the criticisms regarding historical accuracy, citation gaps, and questionable source integration (Average: 4.3/10). The reviewer's expertise in utilitarian intellectual history identifies crucial deficiencies in our treatment of the classical tradition.

**Major Points**:

1. **Severe citation gaps for Bentham and Mill**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism and the reviewer's assessment that working from secondary sources rather than primary texts is evident. This is a fundamental scholarly failure we will correct.
   - **Action taken**: As detailed in response to Reviewer 1, we will add all primary source citations. Beyond merely adding citations, we will revise our characterizations to demonstrate direct engagement with primary texts rather than general knowledge. Each substantive claim about Bentham, Mill, or Sidgwick will include specific chapter/section references.

2. **Historical inaccuracies and oversimplifications**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer's specific corrections are invaluable. We accept that our characterization of Bentham's felicific calculus lacks the specificity required (seven dimensions: intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity, extent), and that Mill's contribution extends well beyond qualitative hedonism to include his broader philosophical anthropology and defense of liberty.
   - **Action taken**: We will revise the Bentham section to:
     - Accurately describe all seven dimensions of the felicific calculus with proper citation
     - Acknowledge the practical difficulties Bentham himself recognized in applying the calculus
     - Discuss Bentham's legal and political reform agenda, not just his hedonistic psychology
   
   We will revise the Mill section to:
     - More carefully explain the higher/lower pleasures distinction and its connection to Mill's theory of human development
     - Integrate Mill's harm principle and arguments for liberty (*On Liberty*, 1859)
     - Address the ongoing scholarly debate about whether Mill's modifications are consistent with classical utilitarianism or represent departure from it
     - Correct the oversimplification about "empirical considerations"—we will more precisely characterize the different epistemological commitments of Bentham (empiricist/associationist) and Mill (influenced by Coleridge, more complex epistemology)

3. **Inadequate treatment of Sidgwick**
   - **Our response**: We agree that Sidgwick's role in systematizing utilitarian theory and identifying tensions with common-sense morality is crucial, especially for a paper on "Theoretical Foundations." His absence of proper treatment is a significant gap.
   - **Action taken**: We will add approximately 600-800 words on Sidgwick covering:
     - The "point of view of the universe" with proper citation to *Methods of Ethics* (Book IV, Chapter 2)
     - His three methods (intuitionism, egoism, utilitarianism) and the dualism of practical reason
     - His identification of tensions between utilitarianism and common-sense morality
     - His influence on 20th-century utilitarian thought (Hare, Parfit)
     - The relationship between Sidgwick's systematic approach and contemporary debates about rule vs. act utilitarianism

4. **Conspicuous absence of Singer**
   - **Our response**: This criticism is particularly pointed and justified. Singer is mentioned in our research focus but barely appears in the manuscript. Given his centrality to contemporary utilitarian thought, especially on animal welfare and global poverty, this is inexcusable.
   - **Action taken**: We will add substantial treatment of Singer (approximately 800-1000 words) covering:
     - *Practical Ethics* (1979, 3rd ed. 2011) on applied utilitarian reasoning
     - *The Expanding Circle* (1981) on evolutionary origins of altruism and expansion of moral concern
     - *Animal Liberation* (1975) and utilitarian arguments against speciesism
     - "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" (1972) on obligations to distant strangers
     - His preference utilitarianism and engagement with meta-ethical debates
     - His role in founding the effective altruism movement
   
   This will be integrated into both the historical development section and the contemporary applications section.

5. **Questionable integration of environmental ethics sources [4] and [5]**
   - **Our response**: This is the most challenging criticism because it questions the coherence of our manuscript's structure. The reviewer suggests these sources feel "forced" and their connection to utilitarian theory proper is "tenuous." We partially agree and partially disagree.
   - **Our response and rationale**: We believe environmental ethics and degrowth literature pose genuine challenges to utilitarian foundations, particularly regarding:
     - Whether all environmental values can be reduced to human (or sentient) welfare
     - Whether infinite substitutability assumptions in standard welfare economics are tenable
     - Whether growth-oriented utilitarian frameworks can address ecological limits
   
   However, we accept that we have not made this connection sufficiently rigorous. The reviewer is correct that we need to either strengthen the theoretical connection or reduce prominence.
   
   - **Action taken**: We will revise the environmental ethics section to:
     - More explicitly frame it as examining whether environmental values pose *external* challenges to utilitarian frameworks (requiring genuine value pluralism) or *internal* challenges (requiring expansion of utilitarian frameworks to include non-anthropocentric welfare)
     - Engage with Norton, B. (1991). *Toward Unity Among Environmentalists* on convergence hypothesis—whether anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric environmental ethics converge in practice
     - Connect to utilitarian debates about moral status and the boundaries of moral consideration (Regan, DeGrazia on animals; Taylor on life-centered ethics; Singer and Jamieson on environmental ethics from utilitarian perspective)
     - More carefully distinguish between: (a) challenges to *hedonistic* utilitarianism that might be addressed by preference or objective list theories, and (b) challenges to *consequentialism itself*
   
   If after this revision the connection still seems forced, we will reduce prominence of [4] and [5], moving environmental ethics to a briefer "applications" subsection rather than treating it as a fundamental theoretical challenge. We will make this determination after completing the revision.

**Minor Points**: 
The reviewer's comment that the manuscript "would not withstand scholarly scrutiny" regarding classical utilitarians is a serious indictment we take to heart. Beyond the specific changes noted above, we will have a colleague with expertise in 19th-century British philosophy review our revised treatment of Bentham, Mill, and Sidgwick to ensure historical accuracy and proper primary source engagement.

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Political Philosophy and Social Justice)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate this reviewer's recognition of our organizational structure and scope while acknowledging the serious weaknesses in citation, theoretical depth, and original contribution (Average: 5.1/10). The reviewer's expertise in distributive justice and institutional design identifies crucial gaps in our analysis.

**Major Points**:

1. **Severe citation deficiencies**
   - **Our response**: As acknowledged in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, this is our highest priority correction. We accept the reviewer's point that even for an intermediate audience, scholarly integrity requires citing sources for fundamental concepts.
   - **Action taken**: Complete citation overhaul as detailed in response to Reviewer 1. We will ensure every substantive claim about utilitarian theory, critiques, or applications includes proper scholarly attribution.

2. **Superficial treatment of distributive justice**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The reviewer's expertise in this area makes their assessment particularly valuable. Our current treatment fails to engage with the technical literature that has transformed these debates.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a new major section (approximately 1,500-1,800 words) titled "Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice" covering:
     - **Formal foundations**: Harsanyi's (1955, 1977) utilitarian aggregation theorem and its significance for utilitarian approaches under uncertainty
     - **Utilitarianism vs. prioritarianism**: Parfit's (1997) "Equality and Priority"; Adler's (2012) *Well-Being and Fair Distribution*; whether prioritarianism represents genuine alternative or utilitarian variant
     - **Ex ante vs. ex post fairness**: Broome's (1991) *Weighing Goods* on fairness and aggregation; Otsuka & Voorhoeve (2009) on separateness of persons and distribution
     - **Measurement and comparability**: Sen's (1985) *Commodities and Capabilities* as critique; debates about interpersonal utility comparisons (Robbins vs. Harsanyi)
     - **Healthcare allocation**: Connect to existing discussion [2] with deeper engagement:
       - Nord, E. (1999) and Dolan, P. (1998) on QALY measurement and valuation
       - Tsuchiya, A. & Williams, A. (2001) on equity considerations in QALYs
       - Brock, D. (2004), Kamm, F. (1993), Wasserman, D. (2001) on disability discrimination concerns
       - Philosophical foundations of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and relationship to utilitarian ethics

3. **Inadequate analysis of effective altruism**
   - **Our response**: We strongly agree this section is underdeveloped given EA's prominence in contemporary applied ethics and its deep roots in utilitarian philosophy. The reviewer's specific suggestions identify crucial missing debates.
   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand the EA section (
