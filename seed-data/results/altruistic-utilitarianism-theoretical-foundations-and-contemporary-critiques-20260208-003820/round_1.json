      "summary": "This manuscript provides a comprehensive survey of altruistic utilitarianism that demonstrates solid understanding of the field but suffers from significant citation gaps and lacks rigorous engagement with technical debates. While the structure is clear and the coverage broad, the analysis remains largely descriptive rather than advancing novel arguments or providing deep critical engagement with the theoretical issues.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of moral philosophy and ethics, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of utilitarian theory but falls short of the rigor expected for advanced scholarship. The most serious deficiency is the extensive use of '[citation needed]' markers throughout foundational discussions\u2014claims about Bentham's felicific calculus, Mill's qualitative hedonism, Sidgwick's point of view of the universe, and Nozick's experience machine are all presented without proper attribution. These are not obscure references but canonical texts that any serious treatment must cite properly.\n\nThe theoretical analysis, while comprehensive in scope, lacks depth in key areas. The discussion of consequentialism would benefit from engagement with scalar consequentialism (Norcross), satisficing consequentialism (Slote), and the debate over maximizing vs. satisficing requirements. The treatment of welfare economics is superficial\u2014there's no engagement with social welfare functions, the Harsanyi-Rawls debate, or formal aggregation theorems beyond a passing mention of Arrow. The moral psychology dimension is particularly underdeveloped given your stated expertise: there's minimal engagement with empirical literature on altruistic motivation, moral judgment, or the psychological feasibility of utilitarian demands.\n\nThe manuscript's engagement with value pluralism [4] is a strength, and the integration of environmental ethics provides valuable contemporary perspective. However, the analysis of how value incommensurability challenges utilitarian aggregation needs more technical precision. The manuscript asserts that pluralism poses problems for commensurability but doesn't rigorously examine whether utilitarian frameworks can accommodate lexical orderings, incomparability, or rough equality.\n\nThe practical applications sections are informative but would benefit from more rigorous normative analysis. The healthcare discussion [2] describes allocation challenges but doesn't deeply engage with the theoretical debate between QALYs, DALYs, and alternative metrics, or with the philosophical foundations of cost-effectiveness analysis. The environmental policy section similarly describes tensions without providing rigorous analysis of discounting debates or the formal structure of intergenerational welfare functions.\n\nFor an intermediate audience, the manuscript succeeds in providing accessible overview, but it needs substantial strengthening of citations, deeper technical engagement with core debates, and more original argumentation to meet publication standards in moral philosophy.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "As a historian of utilitarian thought, I must express serious concerns about this manuscript's treatment of the classical tradition. The foundational sections on Bentham and Mill contain numerous '[citation needed]' markers precisely where primary source citations are most essential. This is not a minor oversight\u2014these are the core texts that define the tradition being analyzed. When discussing Bentham's principle of utility, one must cite 'Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation' (1789), particularly Chapter I. When discussing Mill's qualitative hedonism, one must cite 'Utilitarianism' (1861), Chapter II. The absence of these citations suggests the author may be working from secondary sources or general knowledge rather than direct engagement with primary texts.\n\nMoreover, several characterizations are historically imprecise. Bentham did not simply propose a 'hedonistic calculus'\u2014he developed a specific felicific calculus with seven dimensions (intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity, extent). Mill's contribution was not merely 'qualitative distinctions among pleasures' but a complex argument about higher and lower pleasures tied to his broader philosophical anthropology and his defense of liberty. The manuscript's claim that both thinkers 'shared the conviction that moral philosophy should be grounded in empirical considerations' oversimplifies their quite different epistemological commitments.\n\nThe treatment of Sidgwick is also problematic. The 'point of view of the universe' is mentioned without citation to 'The Methods of Ethics' (1874), and without acknowledging Sidgwick's crucial role in systematizing utilitarian theory and identifying its tensions with common-sense morality. For a paper on 'Theoretical Foundations,' this omission is significant.\n\nRegarding contemporary sources: While [1], [2], and [3] are appropriately integrated, the repeated citation of [4] (environmental values) and [5] (degrowth) feels forced. These papers make important contributions to their respective fields, but their connection to utilitarian theory proper is indirect. The manuscript would be stronger if it either developed a more robust argument about why environmental ethics fundamentally challenges utilitarian foundations, or reduced reliance on these sources in favor of more directly relevant utilitarian scholarship (e.g., Parfit on reasons and persons, Railton on alienation, Kagan on normative ethics).\n\nThe section on Singer is particularly weak\u2014he is mentioned once in passing despite being named in the research focus. Singer's 'Practical Ethics' (1979, multiple editions) and 'The Expanding Circle' (1981) are foundational texts for contemporary utilitarian thought, especially regarding animal welfare and global poverty. His absence is conspicuous.\n\nPositively, the manuscript demonstrates good understanding of contemporary debates about rights, separateness of persons, and the utilitarian-Kantian divide. The discussion of healthcare allocation and democratic theory is competent. However, for a paper claiming to examine 'Theoretical Foundations,' the historical foundation is insufficiently rigorous. This needs substantial revision with proper primary source engagement before it could be considered publication-ready in any serious venue focused on history of utilitarian thought.",

        "Clarify the manuscript's original contribution: Is this a critical survey, a defense of a particular utilitarian variant, or an argument for hybrid approaches? The conclusion gestures toward 'chastened utilitarianism' but this needs development throughout."
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of political philosophy and social justice, this manuscript demonstrates competent familiarity with major debates but lacks the rigor and depth required for significant scholarly contribution. The most serious problem is the citation practice: marking fundamental concepts as '[citation needed]' is inappropriate even for an intermediate audience. While readers may understand what 'Bentham's hedonistic calculus' refers to, scholarly integrity requires citing the source. This pattern suggests either incomplete research or rushed preparation.\n\nRegarding distributive justice\u2014one of my focal areas\u2014the treatment is disappointingly superficial. The manuscript mentions diminishing marginal utility and prioritarianism but fails to engage with the substantial technical literature that has transformed these debates. There's no discussion of Harsanyi's utilitarian aggregation theorem, which provides the formal foundation for utilitarian approaches to distributive justice under uncertainty. The relationship between utilitarianism and prioritarianism (as developed by Parfit, Adler, and others) deserves careful analysis, particularly regarding whether prioritarianism represents a genuine alternative or merely a variant of utilitarianism. The healthcare allocation discussion [2] would benefit from engagement with the extensive QALY literature and debates about disability discrimination (Brock, Kamm, Wasserman).\n\nThe effective altruism section is particularly weak given EA's prominence in contemporary applied ethics. The manuscript treats EA as a recent development without acknowledging its deep roots in utilitarian philosophy or engaging with the substantial philosophical literature it has generated. Key debates are missing: the demandingness objection (Scheffler, Murphy), moral uncertainty and decision-theoretic approaches (MacAskill, Ord), cause prioritization methodology, and critiques regarding systemic change vs. individual optimization (Srinivasan, Rubenstein). The connection between EA and long-termism needs more careful development, including discussion of person-affecting views, population ethics, and the non-identity problem.\n\nOn institutional design, the manuscript gestures toward important questions but lacks substantive engagement. Goodin's work on utilitarianism as public philosophy is essential here but uncited. The discussion of democratic theory [1] would be strengthened by connecting Valentini's arguments to the broader literature on utilitarian institutional design, including debates about optimal voting rules, constitutional constraints, and the relationship between rule-utilitarianism and institutional choice. The manuscript mentions social choice theory and Arrow's theorem but provides no analysis of what these results mean for utilitarian approaches to collective decision-making.\n\nThe environmental ethics section [4][5] is among the strongest, effectively using Himes et al.'s value pluralism framework to challenge utilitarian reductionism. However, even here, the analysis could be deeper. The manuscript should engage with debates about whether environmental values can be accommodated within expanded utilitarian frameworks (Norton's convergence hypothesis) or require genuine value pluralism. The degrowth discussion [5] raises important systemic critiques but doesn't adequately address whether these represent internal critiques of utilitarianism or external challenges from alternative frameworks.\n\nThe manuscript's treatment of the 'separateness of persons' objection [3] is competent but standard. It would benefit from engagement with more recent literature on personal identity and aggregation (Parfit's later work, Temkin on transitivity), and with sophisticated utilitarian responses (Hare's two-level theory, Railton's alienation critique).\n\nOverall, this reads more as a comprehensive literature review than original research. For publication in a serious political philosophy journal, it needs: (1) complete citations for all claims, (2) deeper engagement with technical literature in distributive justice and institutional design, (3) substantial expansion of the EA section with proper scholarly references, (4) a clearer argumentative thesis beyond survey, and (5) more rigorous analysis of the tensions between utilitarian principles and competing values in practical contexts. The manuscript demonstrates competence but not the expertise or originality expected for advancing scholarly debates in political philosophy and social justice.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of altruistic utilitarianism that demonstrates genuine pedagogical value and solid structural organization. All three reviewers acknowledge the clear writing, logical progression from foundations through critiques to applications, and appropriate accessibility for an intermediate audience. The integration of contemporary debates in environmental ethics, democratic theory, and healthcare allocation shows awareness of current scholarship and provides useful connections between classical theory and practical domains.\n\nHowever, the reviewers have identified a fundamental and legitimate concern that cannot be overlooked: the manuscript suffers from severe citation deficiencies that undermine its scholarly credibility. Claims about Bentham, Mill, Sidgwick, Nozick's experience machine, and Arrow's theorem\u2014all foundational to the analysis\u2014lack proper citations. This is not nitpicking; for a philosophy publication, proper attribution to primary sources is a baseline requirement, not an optional enhancement. Reviewer 2's concern about historical accuracy (e.g., oversimplified treatment of Bentham's felicific calculus) compounds this problem. Additionally, all reviewers note the manuscript reads as descriptive synthesis rather than advancing a novel argument or resolving identified tensions\u2014the 'chastened utilitarianism' conclusion needs development throughout rather than appearing only at the end.\n\nThat said, I find some reviewer demands excessive for what appears to be a survey article aimed at intermediate readers. Reviewer 3's extensive list of required additions (mechanism design, constitutional political economy, Harsanyi's aggregation theorem, etc.) would transform this into a different manuscript entirely. The core issues are fixable: add proper citations, strengthen the argumentative throughline, and deepen engagement with 2-3 key debates rather than attempting comprehensive coverage of every subfield. This is Round 1 of 3, and the structural foundation is sound enough to warrant revision opportunity.",

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback. We appreciate the time and expertise invested in evaluating our manuscript. The reviews identify consistent themes that we take seriously: (1) severe citation deficiencies throughout, particularly for foundational utilitarian texts; (2) insufficient technical rigor in engaging with specialized debates in welfare economics, moral psychology, and distributive justice; (3) lack of clear original contribution beyond synthetic survey; and (4) uneven integration of contemporary sources, particularly environmental ethics literature.\n\nWe acknowledge these are serious weaknesses that compromise the manuscript's scholarly integrity and contribution. In this revision, we will: (1) add comprehensive citations for all classical and contemporary sources; (2) substantially deepen technical analysis in key areas (welfare economics, distributive justice, moral psychology); (3) develop a clearer argumentative thesis rather than purely descriptive survey; (4) strengthen engagement with effective altruism and institutional design literature; and (5) either more rigorously connect environmental ethics sources to utilitarian theory or reduce their prominence. We anticipate these revisions will increase the manuscript length by approximately 2,000-3,000 words to accommodate the necessary depth while maintaining accessibility for our intermediate audience.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Moral Philosophy and Ethics)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate this reviewer's recognition of our comprehensive scope and clear structure while acknowledging the serious deficiencies in citation practices and technical rigor (Average: 5.5/10). The reviewer correctly identifies that our manuscript is primarily synthetic rather than advancing novel arguments\u2014a fundamental weakness we will address.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation deficiencies for foundational utilitarian texts**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The extensive '[citation needed]' markers throughout foundational discussions are unacceptable for scholarly work. This represents a serious oversight in manuscript preparation that we will completely rectify.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add comprehensive citations including:\n     - Bentham, J. (1789). *An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation*\n     - Mill, J.S. (1861). *Utilitarianism*\n     - Sidgwick, H. (1874/1907). *The Methods of Ethics*\n     - Nozick, R. (1974). *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (experience machine)\n     - Rawls, J. (1971). *A Theory of Justice* (separateness of persons)\n     - Williams, B. (1973). \"A Critique of Utilitarianism\" in *Utilitarianism: For and Against*\n     - Arrow, K. (1951). *Social Choice and Individual Values*\n     - Hare, R.M. (1981). *Moral Thinking*\n     - Singer, P. (1979). *Practical Ethics*; (1981). *The Expanding Circle*\n   \n   We will also add proper citations for all secondary literature discussed. This is our highest priority revision.\n\n2. **Limited technical rigor in consequentialist debates**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that our treatment lacks engagement with important technical distinctions. The reviewer's specific suggestions (scalar vs. maximizing consequentialism, satisficing variants, threshold deontology) identify crucial gaps.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (approximately 800-1000 words) titled \"Varieties of Consequentialism\" that engages with:\n     - Norcross, A. (2006). \"Reasons without Demands: Rethinking Rightness\" on scalar consequentialism\n     - Slote, M. (1984). \"Satisficing Consequentialism\" and the debate over optimizing vs. satisficing requirements\n     - Scheffler, S. (1982). *The Rejection of Consequentialism* on agent-centered prerogatives\n     - Portmore, D. (2011). *Commonsense Consequentialism* on threshold deontology\n   \n   This will provide the technical precision currently lacking and demonstrate engagement with specialized debates.\n\n3. **Insufficient engagement with moral psychology literature**\n   - **Our response**: This is a particularly important gap given our stated expertise area. The reviewer correctly notes minimal engagement with empirical literature on altruistic motivation and psychological feasibility.\n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand the moral psychology section (currently underdeveloped) with approximately 1,000 words engaging:\n     - Greene, J. (2013). *Moral Tribes* on dual-process theory and utilitarian judgment\n     - Haidt, J. (2012). *The Righteous Mind* on moral foundations and utilitarian reasoning\n     - Bloom, P. (2013). *Just Babies* on developmental origins of moral judgment\n     - Batson, C.D. (2011). *Altruism in Humans* on empathy-altruism hypothesis\n     - Kahane, G. et al. (2018). \"Beyond Sacrificial Harm\" on psychological profiles of utilitarian responders\n   \n   This will ground theoretical discussions in empirical findings about moral cognition and altruistic motivation.\n\n4. **Superficial welfare economics treatment**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our discussion lacks engagement with social welfare functions, formal aggregation problems, and the Harsanyi-Rawls debate. This is essential for rigorous treatment of utilitarian foundations.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new subsection (approximately 700-900 words) titled \"Formal Foundations in Welfare Economics\" covering:\n     - Harsanyi, J. (1955). \"Cardinal Welfare, Individualistic Ethics, and Interpersonal Comparisons of Utility\"\n     - Sen, A. (1970). *Collective Choice and Social Welfare* on aggregation and interpersonal comparisons\n     - The Harsanyi-Rawls debate on utilitarianism vs. maximin under uncertainty\n     - Social welfare functions and their axiomatic foundations\n     - Pareto principles and their relationship to utilitarian aggregation\n   \n   This will provide the technical rigor currently absent.\n\n5. **Value pluralism analysis needs more precision**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that while we identify tensions between value pluralism and utilitarian commensurability, we don't rigorously examine whether utilitarian frameworks can accommodate incommensurability. We will develop this more carefully.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise the value pluralism section to engage with:\n     - Chang, R. (2002). \"The Possibility of Parity\" on incommensurability\n     - Anderson, E. (1993). *Value in Ethics and Economics* on plural value spheres\n     - Whether utilitarian frameworks can accommodate lexical orderings (Rawls), rough equality (Griffin), or incomparability (Raz)\n     - The distinction between value pluralism as external critique vs. internal expansion of utilitarian frameworks (Norton's convergence hypothesis in environmental ethics)\n\n6. **Practical applications need more rigorous normative analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that healthcare and environmental sections describe tensions without sufficient theoretical depth. The reviewer's specific suggestions about QALYs/DALYs debate and discounting are well-taken.\n   - **Action taken**: \n     - Healthcare section: Add engagement with Nord, E. (1999). *Cost-Value Analysis in Health Care*; Dolan, P. (1998) on QALY measurement; Brock, D. (2004) on disability discrimination concerns; philosophical foundations of cost-effectiveness analysis\n     - Environmental section: Add rigorous analysis of discounting debates (Stern vs. Nordhaus), formal structure of intergenerational welfare functions, and Broome's work on climate ethics\n\n**Minor Points**: \nWe will address the reviewer's suggestion to consider narrowing scope for deeper analysis. However, we believe the comprehensive scope serves our intermediate audience well. Instead of narrowing, we will sharpen the argumentative focus (see Summary of Changes) while maintaining breadth. We will ensure all descriptive sections now include critical analysis and engage with debates rather than merely surveying positions.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (History of Utilitarian Thought)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate this reviewer's recognition of our clear structure and accessibility while taking very seriously the criticisms regarding historical accuracy, citation gaps, and questionable source integration (Average: 4.3/10). The reviewer's expertise in utilitarian intellectual history identifies crucial deficiencies in our treatment of the classical tradition.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Severe citation gaps for Bentham and Mill**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism and the reviewer's assessment that working from secondary sources rather than primary texts is evident. This is a fundamental scholarly failure we will correct.\n   - **Action taken**: As detailed in response to Reviewer 1, we will add all primary source citations. Beyond merely adding citations, we will revise our characterizations to demonstrate direct engagement with primary texts rather than general knowledge. Each substantive claim about Bentham, Mill, or Sidgwick will include specific chapter/section references.\n\n2. **Historical inaccuracies and oversimplifications**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer's specific corrections are invaluable. We accept that our characterization of Bentham's felicific calculus lacks the specificity required (seven dimensions: intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity, extent), and that Mill's contribution extends well beyond qualitative hedonism to include his broader philosophical anthropology and defense of liberty.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise the Bentham section to:\n     - Accurately describe all seven dimensions of the felicific calculus with proper citation\n     - Acknowledge the practical difficulties Bentham himself recognized in applying the calculus\n     - Discuss Bentham's legal and political reform agenda, not just his hedonistic psychology\n   \n   We will revise the Mill section to:\n     - More carefully explain the higher/lower pleasures distinction and its connection to Mill's theory of human development\n     - Integrate Mill's harm principle and arguments for liberty (*On Liberty*, 1859)\n     - Address the ongoing scholarly debate about whether Mill's modifications are consistent with classical utilitarianism or represent departure from it\n     - Correct the oversimplification about \"empirical considerations\"\u2014we will more precisely characterize the different epistemological commitments of Bentham (empiricist/associationist) and Mill (influenced by Coleridge, more complex epistemology)\n\n3. **Inadequate treatment of Sidgwick**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that Sidgwick's role in systematizing utilitarian theory and identifying tensions with common-sense morality is crucial, especially for a paper on \"Theoretical Foundations.\" His absence of proper treatment is a significant gap.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add approximately 600-800 words on Sidgwick covering:\n     - The \"point of view of the universe\" with proper citation to *Methods of Ethics* (Book IV, Chapter 2)\n     - His three methods (intuitionism, egoism, utilitarianism) and the dualism of practical reason\n     - His identification of tensions between utilitarianism and common-sense morality\n     - His influence on 20th-century utilitarian thought (Hare, Parfit)\n     - The relationship between Sidgwick's systematic approach and contemporary debates about rule vs. act utilitarianism\n\n4. **Conspicuous absence of Singer**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is particularly pointed and justified. Singer is mentioned in our research focus but barely appears in the manuscript. Given his centrality to contemporary utilitarian thought, especially on animal welfare and global poverty, this is inexcusable.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add substantial treatment of Singer (approximately 800-1000 words) covering:\n     - *Practical Ethics* (1979, 3rd ed. 2011) on applied utilitarian reasoning\n     - *The Expanding Circle* (1981) on evolutionary origins of altruism and expansion of moral concern\n     - *Animal Liberation* (1975) and utilitarian arguments against speciesism\n     - \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\" (1972) on obligations to distant strangers\n     - His preference utilitarianism and engagement with meta-ethical debates\n     - His role in founding the effective altruism movement\n   \n   This will be integrated into both the historical development section and the contemporary applications section.\n\n5. **Questionable integration of environmental ethics sources [4] and [5]**\n   - **Our response**: This is the most challenging criticism because it questions the coherence of our manuscript's structure. The reviewer suggests these sources feel \"forced\" and their connection to utilitarian theory proper is \"tenuous.\" We partially agree and partially disagree.\n   - **Our response and rationale**: We believe environmental ethics and degrowth literature pose genuine challenges to utilitarian foundations, particularly regarding:\n     - Whether all environmental values can be reduced to human (or sentient) welfare\n     - Whether infinite substitutability assumptions in standard welfare economics are tenable\n     - Whether growth-oriented utilitarian frameworks can address ecological limits\n   \n   However, we accept that we have not made this connection sufficiently rigorous. The reviewer is correct that we need to either strengthen the theoretical connection or reduce prominence.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: We will revise the environmental ethics section to:\n     - More explicitly frame it as examining whether environmental values pose *external* challenges to utilitarian frameworks (requiring genuine value pluralism) or *internal* challenges (requiring expansion of utilitarian frameworks to include non-anthropocentric welfare)\n     - Engage with Norton, B. (1991). *Toward Unity Among Environmentalists* on convergence hypothesis\u2014whether anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric environmental ethics converge in practice\n     - Connect to utilitarian debates about moral status and the boundaries of moral consideration (Regan, DeGrazia on animals; Taylor on life-centered ethics; Singer and Jamieson on environmental ethics from utilitarian perspective)\n     - More carefully distinguish between: (a) challenges to *hedonistic* utilitarianism that might be addressed by preference or objective list theories, and (b) challenges to *consequentialism itself*\n   \n   If after this revision the connection still seems forced, we will reduce prominence of [4] and [5], moving environmental ethics to a briefer \"applications\" subsection rather than treating it as a fundamental theoretical challenge. We will make this determination after completing the revision.\n\n**Minor Points**: \nThe reviewer's comment that the manuscript \"would not withstand scholarly scrutiny\" regarding classical utilitarians is a serious indictment we take to heart. Beyond the specific changes noted above, we will have a colleague with expertise in 19th-century British philosophy review our revised treatment of Bentham, Mill, and Sidgwick to ensure historical accuracy and proper primary source engagement.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Political Philosophy and Social Justice)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate this reviewer's recognition of our organizational structure and scope while acknowledging the serious weaknesses in citation, theoretical depth, and original contribution (Average: 5.1/10). The reviewer's expertise in distributive justice and institutional design identifies crucial gaps in our analysis.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Severe citation deficiencies**\n   - **Our response**: As acknowledged in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, this is our highest priority correction. We accept the reviewer's point that even for an intermediate audience, scholarly integrity requires citing sources for fundamental concepts.\n   - **Action taken**: Complete citation overhaul as detailed in response to Reviewer 1. We will ensure every substantive claim about utilitarian theory, critiques, or applications includes proper scholarly attribution.\n\n2. **Superficial treatment of distributive justice**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The reviewer's expertise in this area makes their assessment particularly valuable. Our current treatment fails to engage with the technical literature that has transformed these debates.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new major section (approximately 1,500-1,800 words) titled \"Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice\" covering:\n     - **Formal foundations**: Harsanyi's (1955, 1977) utilitarian aggregation theorem and its significance for utilitarian approaches under uncertainty\n     - **Utilitarianism vs. prioritarianism**: Parfit's (1997) \"Equality and Priority\"; Adler's (2012) *Well-Being and Fair Distribution*; whether prioritarianism represents genuine alternative or utilitarian variant\n     - **Ex ante vs. ex post fairness**: Broome's (1991) *Weighing Goods* on fairness and aggregation; Otsuka & Voorhoeve (2009) on separateness of persons and distribution\n     - **Measurement and comparability**: Sen's (1985) *Commodities and Capabilities* as critique; debates about interpersonal utility comparisons (Robbins vs. Harsanyi)\n     - **Healthcare allocation**: Connect to existing discussion [2] with deeper engagement:\n       - Nord, E. (1999) and Dolan, P. (1998) on QALY measurement and valuation\n       - Tsuchiya, A. & Williams, A. (2001) on equity considerations in QALYs\n       - Brock, D. (2004), Kamm, F. (1993), Wasserman, D. (2001) on disability discrimination concerns\n       - Philosophical foundations of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and relationship to utilitarian ethics\n\n3. **Inadequate analysis of effective altruism**\n   - **Our response**: We strongly agree this section is underdeveloped given EA's prominence in contemporary applied ethics and its deep roots in utilitarian philosophy. The reviewer's specific suggestions identify crucial missing debates.\n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand the EA section (",
