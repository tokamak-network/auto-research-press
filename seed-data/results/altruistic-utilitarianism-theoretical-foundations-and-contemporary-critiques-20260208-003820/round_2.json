        "Comprehensive citation overhaul with proper primary source references throughout\u2014Bentham's *Introduction* (1789), Mill's *Utilitarianism* (1861), Sidgwick's *Methods of Ethics* (1874/1907), Singer's major works, and extensive secondary literature are now properly cited with specific chapter/section references",
        "Historically accurate and nuanced treatment of classical utilitarians: Bentham's seven-dimensional felicific calculus is correctly specified; Mill's qualitative hedonism is properly contextualized within his broader philosophical anthropology and defense of liberty; Sidgwick receives substantial treatment (600-800 words) including his 'point of view of the universe,' dualism of practical reason, and systematic identification of tensions",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Singer's treatment, while much improved, could be more systematically integrated\u2014he appears in scattered locations rather than receiving unified treatment proportional to his significance for contemporary utilitarianism (the authors promised 800-1000 words but the integration feels somewhat fragmented)",
        "The environmental ethics sections [4][5], while better connected to utilitarian theory than in Round 1, still occasionally feel like they're stretching to maintain relevance\u2014the connection between degrowth literature and utilitarian foundations remains the manuscript's weakest theoretical link",
        "Minor organizational issue: the manuscript has grown substantially (appears to exceed stated 2,000-3,000 word increase) and some sections could benefit from tighter integration\u2014the 'Chastened Utilitarianism' synthesis in the conclusion feels somewhat rushed given the extensive groundwork laid earlier"

        "Either strengthen the theoretical connection between environmental ethics/degrowth and utilitarian foundations more explicitly (perhaps by framing it as examining whether environmental values require abandoning welfarism entirely vs. expanding utilitarian frameworks) or consider moving this material to a briefer 'Contemporary Applications' subsection rather than treating it as a fundamental theoretical challenge",
        "The conclusion's discussion of 'chastened utilitarianism' is promising but underdeveloped relative to the manuscript's length\u2014consider expanding this synthesis by 500-800 words to more systematically articulate how the six features you identify constitute a coherent theoretical position rather than ad hoc modifications"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "As a historian of utilitarian thought, I am genuinely impressed by the transformation this manuscript has undergone. The Round 1 version suffered from severe citation deficiencies and historical inaccuracies that would have been unacceptable for scholarly publication. The authors have taken the criticism seriously and produced a manuscript that now demonstrates genuine engagement with primary sources and sophisticated understanding of utilitarian intellectual history.\n\nThe treatment of Bentham is now historically accurate and properly cited. The specification of all seven dimensions of the felicific calculus (intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity, extent) with proper citation to *Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation* represents exactly the kind of precision required. The acknowledgment that Bentham himself recognized practical difficulties in applying the calculus shows nuanced understanding rather than caricature. The contextualization of Bentham's hedonism within his broader legal and political reform agenda demonstrates that the authors understand his project as more than abstract moral philosophy.\n\nThe Mill section similarly shows dramatic improvement. The discussion of qualitative hedonism is now properly cited to *Utilitarianism* (1861) with the famous 'Socrates dissatisfied' passage. More importantly, the authors now acknowledge Mill's broader philosophical contributions including his defense of liberty in *On Liberty* (1859) and his more complex epistemology influenced by Romantic critics like Coleridge. The recognition that scholarly debate continues about whether Mill's modifications are consistent with classical utilitarianism or represent departure from it shows appropriate engagement with historiographical questions. The correction of the oversimplification about 'empirical considerations' and more precise characterization of the different epistemological commitments of Bentham (empiricist/associationist) versus Mill demonstrates genuine historical sophistication.\n\nThe addition of substantial treatment of Sidgwick (approximately 600-800 words as promised) fills a crucial gap. The discussion of 'the point of view of the universe' with proper citation to *Methods of Ethics* (Book IV, Chapter 2), the three methods (intuitionism, egoism, utilitarianism), the dualism of practical reason, and the identification of tensions between utilitarianism and common-sense morality represents exactly what was needed. The recognition of Sidgwick's influence on 20th-century utilitarian thought (Hare, Parfit) properly situates him as the bridge between classical and contemporary utilitarianism.\n\nThe treatment of Singer, while much improved, remains the one area where I have reservations. The authors promised 800-1000 words of substantial treatment covering *Practical Ethics*, *The Expanding Circle*, *Animal Liberation*, 'Famine, Affluence, and Morality,' preference utilitarianism, and his role in founding effective altruism. This material does appear in the manuscript, but it feels somewhat scattered rather than receiving the unified, systematic treatment that Singer's significance warrants. Given that Singer is arguably the most influential utilitarian philosopher of the late 20th/early 21st century, and given that he was explicitly mentioned in the research focus, I would have liked to see a dedicated subsection that brings together his various contributions into a coherent account of his distinctive approach to utilitarian ethics. The current treatment is adequate but could be more systematically integrated.\n\nThe new sections on varieties of consequentialism, formal foundations in welfare economics, and moral psychology demonstrate exactly the kind of technical sophistication that was lacking in Round 1. The engagement with Norcross on scalar consequentialism, Slote on satisficing, Scheffler on agent-centered prerogatives, and Portmore on threshold deontology shows genuine engagement with specialized debates in consequentialist theory. The treatment of Harsanyi's aggregation theorem, social welfare functions, and the Harsanyi-Rawls debate provides the rigorous formal foundations that welfare economics requires. The moral psychology section's engagement with Greene's dual-process theory, Haidt's moral foundations, Bloom's developmental work, Batson's empathy-altruism hypothesis, and Kahane's two-dimensional model represents substantial improvement in empirical grounding.\n\nRegarding the environmental ethics sections [4][5], I acknowledge the authors' thoughtful response to my Round 1 criticism. They have made genuine efforts to strengthen the theoretical connection between environmental values and utilitarian foundations, framing it as examining whether environmental values pose external challenges (requiring genuine value pluralism) or internal challenges (requiring expansion of utilitarian frameworks). The engagement with Norton's convergence hypothesis and the distinction between challenges to hedonistic utilitarianism versus challenges to consequentialism itself shows more sophisticated analysis. However, I remain somewhat skeptical that this material is as central to 'Theoretical Foundations and Contemporary Critiques' as the manuscript's structure suggests. The connection between Paulson's degrowth analysis [5] and utilitarian theory proper still feels somewhat forced\u2014degrowth critiques target growth-oriented economics and capitalism more than utilitarian moral philosophy specifically. I would not insist on removing this material, but I do think it represents the manuscript's weakest theoretical link.\n\nThe conclusion's discussion of 'chastened utilitarianism' is promising and represents genuine theoretical contribution. The identification of six features (sophisticated welfare accounts, prioritarian weighting, rights as institutional rules, agent-centered prerogatives, criterion/procedure distinction, accommodation of value pluralism and moral uncertainty) provides a useful framework for understanding contemporary utilitarian evolution. However, given the manuscript's substantial length and the extensive groundwork laid in earlier sections, this synthesis feels somewhat rushed. I would encourage the authors to expand this discussion to more systematically articulate how these features constitute a coherent theoretical position rather than ad hoc modifications, and to more explicitly address the question of whether chastened utilitarianism remains genuinely utilitarian or represents a hybrid theory that has abandoned core commitments.\n\nMinor points: The manuscript has grown substantially beyond the stated 2,000-3,000 word increase (it appears to be approximately 15,000-16,000 words now). While the additional length is justified by the depth of analysis required, some sections could benefit from tighter editing. The healthcare allocation section, while excellent, is quite lengthy and might be condensed slightly. The effective altruism section is thorough but could potentially be streamlined.\n\nOverall assessment: This revision represents exemplary scholarly response to criticism. The authors have systematically addressed virtually every concern raised in Round 1, adding comprehensive citations, correcting historical inaccuracies, and substantially deepening technical analysis. The manuscript now demonstrates genuine rigor in its treatment of utilitarian intellectual history and merits publication. My remaining suggestions are relatively minor refinements rather than fundamental revisions. The transformation from Round 1 to Round 2 is remarkable and commendable.",

      "detailed_feedback": "As a reviewer specializing in political philosophy and social justice, I am pleased to see the substantial improvements in this revision. The authors have taken Round 1 feedback seriously and addressed most critical deficiencies, particularly the citation gaps and superficial treatment of distributive justice that were unacceptable in scholarly work.\n\nThe new section on formal welfare economics (Harsanyi 1955, 1977; Sen 1970, 1985; Broome 1991) provides exactly the technical rigor that was missing. The treatment of Harsanyi's aggregation theorem, the debate with Rawls over original position reasoning, and the relationship between utilitarianism and prioritarianism (Parfit 1997, Adler 2012) demonstrates genuine engagement with specialized literature. The discussion of ex ante vs. ex post fairness and the separateness of persons objection shows sophisticated understanding of contemporary debates. This represents a major improvement.\n\nThe healthcare allocation section now includes the QALY literature I specifically requested (Nord 1999, Dolan 1998, Tsuchiya & Williams 2001, Brock 2004, Kamm 1993, Wasserman 2001) and engages seriously with disability discrimination concerns. The connection to Marchand et al. [2] on social determinants of health is well-integrated, showing how utilitarian approaches must be situated within broader frameworks of social justice. The COVID-19 allocation discussion illustrates practical tensions effectively.\n\nThe effective altruism section is substantially improved with proper scholarly engagement (MacAskill 2015, 2020; Ord 2020; Singer 1972; Srinivasan 2015; Gabriel 2017). The treatment of demandingness objections, moral uncertainty frameworks, and long-termism demonstrates awareness of cutting-edge debates. The discussion of population ethics challenges (Parfit's Repugnant Conclusion, non-identity problem) shows appropriate philosophical sophistication.\n\nHowever, significant weaknesses remain. Most importantly, the manuscript still lacks a clear original contribution beyond sophisticated synthesis. The 'chastened utilitarianism' thesis is introduced and referenced throughout but never fully developed as a distinctive position. What exactly are the essential features of chastened utilitarianism? How does it differ from existing hybrid theories? Which qualifications are necessary vs. optional? The manuscript gestures toward answers but doesn't provide systematic articulation.\n\nThe institutional design section remains underdeveloped despite being a major Round 1 criticism. While Goodin (1995), Brennan & Buchanan (1985), and List & Pettit (2011) are now cited, the analysis lacks depth on mechanism design, optimal constitutions, and voting rules. The relationship between Valentini [1] and utilitarian institutional design is still superficial\u2014the manuscript cites her work on justice, disagreement, and democracy but doesn't deeply engage with how reasonable pluralism challenges utilitarian public philosophy or what institutional implications follow. This was specifically requested in Round 1 and has been only partially addressed.\n\nSome newly added sections feel encyclopedic rather than analytical. The varieties of consequentialism section describes scalar consequentialism (Norcross 2006), satisficing (Slote 1984), agent-centered prerogatives (Scheffler 1982), and threshold deontology (Portmore 2011) without sufficient critical assessment. Which variants are most defensible? How do they relate to the chastened utilitarianism thesis? The moral psychology section similarly describes dual-process theory (Greene 2013), moral foundations (Haidt 2012), and empathy-altruism (Batson 2011) without fully integrating these findings into normative arguments.\n\nThe conclusion trails off without completing the final paragraph, suggesting rushed completion. This is particularly problematic because the conclusion should synthesize the chastened utilitarianism thesis and articulate the manuscript's distinctive contribution. Instead, it ends mid-sentence discussing practical applications.\n\nFrom my expertise in distributive justice and institutional design, I can confirm that the technical content is now largely accurate and appropriately sophisticated for an intermediate audience. The treatment of Harsanyi, Rawls, Sen, Parfit, and contemporary prioritarian debates demonstrates genuine understanding. However, the manuscript needs to move beyond describing these debates to taking positions and defending arguments. What is the manuscript's contribution to these ongoing controversies?\n\nFor publication, I recommend: (1) Developing chastened utilitarianism as a systematic position with clear commitments, (2) Substantially expanding institutional design analysis with deeper engagement of Valentini [1] and mechanism design literature, (3) Transforming descriptive sections into critical analysis that assesses competing positions, (4) Completing the conclusion with proper synthesis, and (5) Clarifying whether this is primarily a critical survey or a defense of a particular position. With these revisions, this could become a strong contribution to the literature on utilitarian theory and its evolution in response to criticism.",

The manuscript now represents serious scholarship that engages appropriately with both classical and contemporary literature. However, the revision's success in addressing specific gaps has created a new structural challenge: the manuscript now attempts to cover too much ground, resulting in a somewhat fragmented structure where individual sections are strong but overall coherence suffers. The 'chastened utilitarianism' thesis, while promising, needs to be developed more systematically throughout rather than emerging primarily in the conclusion. The environmental ethics integration, despite improvements, still feels somewhat tangential to core theoretical foundations. For an intermediate audience, the manuscript would benefit from either narrowing scope to focus specifically on theoretical foundations or restructuring to make the synthetic argument more prominent from the outset. The technical level is now appropriate for serious philosophical engagement but varies across sections in ways that may challenge accessibility. Overall, this represents publishable work that requires further refinement of scope and argumentative focus rather than fundamental reconstruction.

The authors have systematically addressed the critical deficiencies that plagued the original submission: comprehensive citations now support all major claims, historical treatment of classical utilitarians is accurate and nuanced, and substantial new sections on welfare economics, moral psychology, and varieties of consequentialism demonstrate genuine scholarly rigor. All three reviewers acknowledge this dramatic improvement, with Reviewer 1 explicitly stating the manuscript 'merits publication with only minor refinements.'\n\nThe remaining concerns cluster around two issues: (1) the 'chastened utilitarianism' thesis, while present throughout, is not fully developed as a distinctive contribution in the conclusion, and (2) some sections (particularly environmental ethics) feel somewhat disconnected from the core argument. However, I assess these as refinement issues rather than fundamental flaws. The reviewers' calls for 'original contribution beyond synthesis' and demands for 1,500-2,000 additional words on institutional design strike me as calibration issues\u2014they are applying standards appropriate for a specialized research article rather than what appears to be a comprehensive scholarly survey aimed at an intermediate audience. A well-executed synthesis that accurately maps a complex theoretical landscape IS a contribution, particularly for philosophy where such surveys serve crucial pedagogical and field-organizing functions.\n\nGiven the extraordinary improvement trajectory, the consensus that core scholarly standards are now met, and the fact that remaining issues are genuinely minor and clearly fixable, I am recommending minor revision rather than another major revision cycle. The authors have demonstrated they can execute revisions effectively; asking for another wholesale restructuring at Round 2 of 3 would be diminishing returns.

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe are deeply grateful to all three reviewers for their exceptionally thorough and constructive engagement with our revised manuscript. The transformation from Round 1 to Round 2 reflects our serious commitment to addressing the critical deficiencies identified, and we are encouraged that all reviewers recognize substantial improvements in citation apparatus, historical accuracy, technical rigor, and theoretical depth.\n\nThe reviewers converge on several key themes: (1) the manuscript has successfully corrected fundamental scholarly deficiencies from Round 1, particularly regarding citations and primary source engagement; (2) technical content in welfare economics, distributive justice, and moral psychology now demonstrates appropriate sophistication; (3) the \"chastened utilitarianism\" thesis, while promising, requires more systematic development as the manuscript's central contribution; (4) scope has expanded significantly, creating both opportunities and challenges for coherence; and (5) certain sections (particularly environmental ethics and institutional design) require either strengthening or reconceptualization.\n\nWe have carefully considered each reviewer's feedback and propose targeted revisions that will: (1) develop \"chastened utilitarianism\" as a systematic theoretical position throughout the manuscript rather than primarily in the conclusion; (2) consolidate and strengthen Singer's treatment; (3) substantially expand institutional design analysis with deeper engagement of mechanism design literature and Valentini [1]; (4) transform descriptive sections into critical analysis that advances arguments rather than merely surveying positions; (5) complete and expand the conclusion; and (6) address scope and coherence concerns through strategic restructuring and tighter integration.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (History of Utilitarian Thought)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We are gratified by Reviewer 1's assessment that our revision \"represents a dramatic and commendable improvement\" and \"now demonstrates genuine scholarly rigor\" (8.5/10 average). As a historian of utilitarian thought, this reviewer's recognition that we have corrected historical inaccuracies and demonstrated \"genuine engagement with primary sources and sophisticated understanding of utilitarian intellectual history\" is particularly meaningful. We take seriously the remaining suggestions for refinement.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Singer's fragmented treatment despite improved coverage**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. While we added substantial Singer material as promised (preference utilitarianism, animal ethics, global poverty, effective altruism), the reviewer correctly identifies that it appears \"scattered rather than receiving unified treatment proportional to his significance.\" For a philosopher who is \"arguably the most influential utilitarian of the late 20th/early 21st century,\" this fragmentation is inappropriate.\n   - **Action taken**: We will create a dedicated subsection (approximately 1,200 words) titled \"Singer and Contemporary Applied Utilitarianism\" that systematically consolidates: (a) his development of preference utilitarianism as response to hedonistic limitations; (b) animal ethics and the expansion of moral consideration; (c) global poverty arguments and demanding obligations; (d) role in founding effective altruism; (e) his distinctive methodological approach of applying utilitarian principles to concrete cases; and (f) criticisms of his work (Srinivasan 2015, Gabriel 2017). This will appear as a major subsection following the Sidgwick treatment, creating a clear historical progression from classical utilitarianism through Sidgwick's systematization to Singer's contemporary applied approach.\n\n2. **Environmental ethics sections remain theoretically weak despite improvements**\n   - **Our response**: We appreciate the reviewer's acknowledgment that we made \"genuine efforts to strengthen the theoretical connection\" and framed the question more sophisticatedly (external vs. internal challenges). However, we accept the assessment that \"the connection between degrowth literature [5] and utilitarian theory proper still feels somewhat forced\" and represents \"the manuscript's weakest theoretical link.\"\n   - **Action taken**: Rather than removing this material entirely (as we believe environmental challenges do raise important questions for utilitarian theory), we will restructure it significantly:\n     - **Reduce prominence**: Move environmental ethics from a major theoretical section to a subsection within \"Contemporary Applications and Extensions\" (alongside EA and healthcare allocation)\n     - **Tighten focus**: Reduce environmental ethics coverage from approximately 2,500 words to 1,200-1,500 words, focusing specifically on whether environmental values require abandoning welfarism (Norton's convergence hypothesis, sentientism vs. biocentrism) rather than extensive engagement with degrowth literature\n     - **Explicit framing**: Add clear statement that environmental ethics represents an \"application domain\" that tests utilitarian frameworks rather than a fundamental theoretical challenge parallel to distributive justice or value pluralism\n     - **Relocate Paulson [5]**: Move detailed degrowth discussion to a brief footnote acknowledging systemic economic critiques while noting their primary target is capitalism/growth economics rather than utilitarian moral philosophy specifically\n   \n   This restructuring addresses the reviewer's concern while preserving the legitimate question of whether environmental values can be accommodated within utilitarian frameworks.\n\n3. **\"Chastened utilitarianism\" synthesis underdeveloped relative to manuscript length**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely justified. The reviewer notes that the conclusion \"feels somewhat rushed given the extensive groundwork laid earlier\" and that we need to \"more systematically articulate how these features constitute a coherent theoretical position rather than ad hoc modifications.\" This echoes concerns from Reviewers 2 and 3 about underdevelopment of our stated theoretical contribution.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand the conclusion by 800-1,000 words to provide systematic articulation of chastened utilitarianism as a coherent position:\n     - **Coherence argument**: Explain how the six identified features (sophisticated welfare accounts, prioritarian weighting, rights as institutional rules, agent-centered prerogatives, criterion/procedure distinction, value pluralism accommodation) constitute a unified framework rather than ad hoc modifications\u2014specifically, they represent systematic responses to the \"separateness of persons\" and \"demandingness\" objections while preserving utilitarian insights about welfare aggregation and consequentialist evaluation\n     - **Boundary conditions**: Address the crucial question of what makes this \"chastened\" rather than \"abandoned\" by specifying which core commitments remain (welfarism, consequentialism, aggregation) and which are qualified (hedonism, impartiality, act-guidance)\n     - **Comparison to alternatives**: Distinguish chastened utilitarianism from existing hybrid theories (Scanlon's contractualism, Kamm's non-consequentialism, Scheffler's hybrid view) by showing how it retains utilitarian structure while incorporating constraints\n     - **Remaining tensions**: Honestly acknowledge which tensions remain unresolved (e.g., whether agent-centered prerogatives are consistent with consequentialism, whether value pluralism undermines aggregation)\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\n- **Manuscript length**: We acknowledge the manuscript has grown beyond the stated 2,000-3,000 word increase (now approximately 15,000-16,000 words). While the reviewer notes \"the additional length is justified by the depth of analysis required,\" we will tighten several sections through the restructuring described above (consolidating Singer, reducing environmental ethics, streamlining healthcare allocation by 300-400 words) to bring total length to approximately 14,000-14,500 words.\n\n- **Organizational improvements**: We will add clearer signposting throughout to show how each section contributes to the chastened utilitarianism thesis, addressing the concern that some sections feel somewhat disconnected from the overall argument.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Political Philosophy and Social Justice)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 2's recognition that our revision \"represents a substantial improvement over Round 1, successfully addressing most critical deficiencies\" (7.7/10 average). The reviewer's expertise in distributive justice and institutional design makes their feedback particularly valuable, and we take seriously the criticisms that remain: limited original contribution beyond synthesis, underdeveloped institutional design section, and incomplete conclusion.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Limited original contribution\u2014\"chastened utilitarianism\" thesis gestured toward but not fully developed**\n   - **Our response**: This is the reviewer's central criticism and we accept it fully. The reviewer correctly identifies that \"the manuscript primarily surveys existing debates rather than advancing novel arguments or resolving contested questions\" and that the chastened utilitarianism thesis is \"introduced and referenced throughout but never fully developed as a distinctive position.\" This echoes Reviewer 1's concern about underdevelopment and Reviewer 3's observation that the manuscript \"still reads primarily as comprehensive survey.\"\n   - **Action taken**: We will make chastened utilitarianism the explicit organizing framework from the introduction onward:\n     - **Introduction restructuring**: Add 600-800 words articulating chastened utilitarianism as the manuscript's central thesis, specifying: (a) what modifications are essential vs. optional; (b) how they cohere into unified framework; (c) what makes this recognizably utilitarian rather than a different theory; (d) how it differs from existing hybrid theories (Scanlon, Kamm, Scheffler)\n     - **Section integration**: Restructure each major section to explicitly connect to chastened utilitarianism development\u2014e.g., distributive justice section shows how prioritarianism and ex ante fairness represent responses to separateness of persons while preserving aggregation; value pluralism section examines whether accommodation requires abandoning consequentialism; moral psychology section assesses whether empirical findings support or challenge utilitarian commitments\n     - **Critical analysis**: Transform descriptive passages into arguments that defend specific positions within debates\u2014e.g., argue for scalar consequentialism over satisficing as most defensible variant; defend criterion/procedure distinction as resolving demandingness; assess whether empathy-altruism findings support utilitarian moral psychology\n     - **Expanded conclusion**: As described in response to Reviewer 1, develop systematic articulation of chastened utilitarianism as coherent theoretical position (800-1,000 additional words)\n\n2. **Institutional design section underdeveloped despite Round 1 criticism**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this criticism is entirely justified. The reviewer notes this \"was a major Round 1 criticism that has been only partially addressed\" and that while we added citations to Goodin (1995), Brennan & Buchanan (1985), and List & Pettit (2011), \"the analysis lacks depth on mechanism design, optimal constitutions, and the relationship between rule-utilitarianism and institutional structures.\" The superficial treatment of Valentini [1] is particularly problematic given the manuscript's stated focus.\n   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand institutional design analysis (adding 1,800-2,000 words):\n     - **Mechanism design foundations**: Add rigorous treatment of mechanism design literature (Maskin 2008, Hurwicz 2008) showing how utilitarian objectives can be implemented through institutional rules when agents have private information\u2014connect to rule-utilitarianism by showing how optimal mechanisms represent rule-like constraints that maximize expected welfare\n     - **Constitutional political economy**: Expand beyond Brennan & Buchanan to engage optimal constitution literature, examining how utilitarian frameworks approach constitutional constraints, separation of powers, and rights protections\u2014address whether constitutional rules should maximize expected welfare or satisfy proceduralist constraints\n     - **Deep engagement with Valentini [1]**: Add substantial analysis (600-800 words) of how reasonable pluralism challenges utilitarian public philosophy:\n       * Examine Valentini's arguments about justice, disagreement, and democracy\n       * Address whether utilitarian institutions should aim to maximize expected welfare given uncertainty about justice or adopt proceduralist constraints that limit welfare maximization\n       * Explore whether reasonable disagreement requires abandoning utilitarian foundations for public institutions or can be accommodated within utilitarian frameworks through meta-uncertainty reasoning\n       * Connect to broader debates about political legitimacy and public reason\n     - **Voting rules and collective decision**: Engage literature on optimal voting rules from utilitarian perspective (List & Pettit 2011, Goodin & List 2006), examining majority rule, supermajority requirements, and deliberative procedures\n     - **Integration with chastened utilitarianism**: Show how institutional design connects to chastened utilitarianism thesis\u2014specifically, whether rights as \"institutional rules\" and procedural constraints represent genuine utilitarian positions or departures from utilitarian foundations\n\n3. **Varieties of consequentialism section encyclopedic rather than analytical**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly observes that this section \"describes positions without sufficient critical engagement or assessment of which variants are most defensible.\" This reflects a broader problem the reviewer identifies: too much description, insufficient argument.\n   - **Action taken**: We will transform this section from descriptive survey to critical analysis:\n     - **Argumentative structure**: Reorganize around the question \"Which variant of consequentialism best addresses demandingness while preserving utilitarian insights?\"\n     - **Defend scalar consequentialism**: Argue that Norcross's (2006) scalar approach best preserves utilitarian structure while avoiding artificial right/wrong boundary\u2014connect to chastened utilitarianism by showing how scalar view accommodates agent-centered prerogatives without abandoning consequentialism\n     - **Critical assessment of alternatives**: Explain why satisficing (Slote 1984) is theoretically unmotivated (arbitrary threshold problem) and why threshold deontology (Portmore 2011) collapses into either deontology or consequentialism depending on threshold specification\n     - **Scheffler's agent-centered prerogatives**: Provide detailed analysis of whether these are consistent with consequentialism or represent hybrid theory\u2014defend interpretation that prerogatives can be consequentially justified through second-order reasoning about moral psychology and sustainability\n     - **Connection to demandingness**: Show how these debates directly address whether utilitarianism can accommodate reasonable limits on sacrifice while remaining recognizably utilitarian\n\n4. **Conclusion incomplete and rushed**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge the serious problem that \"the conclusion trails off without completing the final paragraph, suggesting rushed completion.\" This is unacceptable for scholarly publication.\n   - **Action taken**: As described in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, we will complete and substantially expand the conclusion (800-1,000 additional words) to provide proper synthesis. This will include: (1) systematic articulation of chastened utilitarianism as coherent position; (2) summary of which critiques have been successfully addressed vs. which remain problematic; (3) specification of what makes this synthesis defensible rather than unstable compromise; (4) explicit statement of manuscript's distinctive contribution; (5) proper completion of final paragraph on practical applications.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\n- **Clarify audience and purpose**: The reviewer asks \"Is this a critical survey for students, a defense of chastened utilitarianism for specialists, or a meta-theoretical analysis of how utilitarian theory has evolved?\" We will clarify in the introduction that this is a critical survey for intermediate audiences that develops and defends a specific thesis (chastened utilitarianism) about how utilitarian theory should evolve in response to criticism\u2014thus combining pedagogical and argumentative purposes.\n\n- **Environmental ethics**: As discussed in response to Reviewer 1, we will reduce prominence and tighten connection to utilitarian foundations, addressing the reviewer's concern that \"the connection between degrowth literature [5] and utilitarian theory remains somewhat forced.\"\n\n- **Technical level**: We acknowledge the concern about \"uneven technical level across sections\" and will add brief explanatory notes for technical concepts in welfare economics section while maintaining rigor.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Moral Philosophy and Ethics)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We are grateful for Reviewer 3's recognition of \"extraordinary improvement over Round 1\" and assessment that the manuscript \"now represents serious scholarship that engages appropriately with both classical and contemporary literature\" (7.8/10 average). We appreciate the reviewer's acknowledgment that we have \"demonstrated capacity for rigorous revision\" while recognizing that \"further refinement is needed to fully realize the manuscript's potential.\"\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Scope creep creating coherence challenges**\n   - **Our response**: This is an incisive diagnosis of a structural problem created by our comprehensive response to Round 1 feedback. The reviewer correctly identifies that the manuscript \"now attempts comprehensive coverage of too many topics (classical foundations, welfare economics, moral psychology, environmental ethics, democratic theory, EA, healthcare, institutional design), creating coherence challenges and preventing deep engagement with any single area.\"\n   - **Action taken**: We have carefully considered the reviewer's suggestion to \"narrow scope by moving practical applications (EA, healthcare allocation, environmental policy) to separate companion paper.\" However, we believe the better approach is the reviewer's alternative: \"restructure to make 'chastened utilitarianism' thesis prominent from introduction, using each section to develop specific aspects of this synthesis rather than comprehensively surveying debates.\" This preserves the manuscript's comprehensive scope while providing argumentative coherence. Specifically:\n     - **Introduction restructuring**: As described in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, make chastened utilitarianism the explicit organizing framework from the outset\n     - **Section integration**: Add explicit signposting showing how each section contributes to developing chastened utilitarianism\u2014e.g., \"This section examines whether utilitarian frameworks can accommodate prioritarian concerns while preserving aggregative structure, a key component of chastened utilitarianism's response to distributive justice objections\"\n     - **Reduce environmental ethics**: As described above, move environmental material to \"Contemporary Applications\" subsection and reduce length, addressing both scope and coherence concerns\n     - **Tighten practical applications**: Streamline EA and healthcare sections (reducing by 400-500 words combined) to focus specifically on how they illustrate chastened utilitarianism principles rather than providing comprehensive coverage\n     - **Institutional design expansion**: As described in response to Reviewer 2, substantially expand this section to provide depth in at least one area rather than superficial coverage of everything\n\n2. **\"Chastened utilitarianism\" thesis underdeveloped until final sections**\n   - **Our response**: This echoes the central criticism from all three reviewers. Reviewer 3 observes that despite our",
