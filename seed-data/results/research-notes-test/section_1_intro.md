# Introduction

Ethereum's Layer 2 scaling solutions have historically faced a significant economic constraint: the cost of posting transaction data to mainnet for data availability. Prior to March 2024, rollups—the dominant L2 architecture—relied on calldata to publish compressed transaction batches, incurring costs of approximately 16 gas per byte. For a typical 128 KB data submission, this translated to roughly 2 million gas units, or approximately 0.1 ETH at moderate gas prices (Buterin, 2023). Analysis from L2Beat indicates that data availability costs represented 80-95% of total L2 operating expenses, with major rollups like Optimism spending an estimated $2-5 million monthly on calldata posting alone.

EIP-4844, activated in the Dencun upgrade on March 13, 2024, fundamentally restructures this cost equation by introducing "blob-carrying transactions"—a new transaction type that attaches approximately 125 KB data segments committed via KZG polynomial commitments. Unlike calldata, blob data remains inaccessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is pruned from consensus layer storage after approximately 18 days (4,096 epochs), sufficient time for L2s to process data and resolve disputes (Ethereum Foundation, 2024). This architectural distinction enables substantially lower pricing through a separate fee market.

This paper examines three interconnected research questions regarding EIP-4844's economic implications. First, we quantify the magnitude of cost reduction for L2 transaction processing, comparing theoretical projections of 10-100x savings against observed post-deployment metrics showing 5-10x reductions and 93-96% cost savings for major rollups. Second, we analyze theoretical throughput capacity, where the protocol's target of 3 blobs per block (375 KB) with a maximum of 6 blobs (750 KB) yields approximately 5.5 TB daily data availability for the aggregate L2 ecosystem. Third, we investigate the blob gas market mechanism—an independent EIP-1559-style fee market with exponential price adjustment—and its dynamics under varying demand conditions.

Understanding these economics carries significance beyond technical optimization. EIP-4844 represents what Buterin characterizes as "scaffolding" for full danksharding, establishing the transaction formats and verification infrastructure that will underpin Ethereum's long-term data availability scaling. The success of this intermediate solution—measured through cost reduction magnitude, throughput utilization patterns, and market stability—will inform both the timeline and design parameters for subsequent protocol upgrades while shaping competitive dynamics across the L2 ecosystem.
