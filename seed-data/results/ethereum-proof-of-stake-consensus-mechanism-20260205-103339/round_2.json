The partial synchrony model is correctly specified, and the accountable safety theorem is properly stated. However, the analysis lacks depth in several critical areas including formal treatment of the Gasper composition's known issues and incomplete coverage of synchrony boundary behaviors.",

        "Missing discussion of the known Gasper composition issues documented in 'Three Attacks on Proof-of-Stake Ethereum' (Schwarz-Schilling et al., 2022) - while balancing attack is mentioned, the avalanche attack and its implications for the LMD-GHOST/Casper-FFG interaction are absent",
        "The synchrony analysis is incomplete: no discussion of what happens at the GST boundary, how the protocol behaves during the transition from asynchrony to synchrony, or the practical implications of unknown GST for validator strategy",
        "The finality timing analysis omits important edge cases: the manuscript states 12.8 minutes for finality but doesn't adequately address scenarios where finalization takes longer (e.g., when justification gaps occur or during the k-finality fallback path)"

        "Include formal analysis of the view-merge problem in LMD-GHOST - specifically how validators with different views of the network can reach different fork choice conclusions even when following the protocol honestly, and how this interacts with proposer boost timing"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the core consensus mechanisms but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive technical analysis. The treatment of Casper-FFG is largely correct, with proper formalization of checkpoints, supermajority links, and the justification/finalization predicates. The accountable safety theorem is correctly stated, though the proof sketch could be more rigorous in handling the case analysis for surround votes versus double votes.\n\nThe LMD-GHOST section correctly describes the fork choice rule but underspecifies critical implementation details. The get_latest_attesting_balance function's behavior when validators have equivocated is not addressed - the protocol must handle this edge case to prevent attackers from having their votes counted on multiple branches. Additionally, the manuscript doesn't discuss the filter_block_tree optimization that prunes branches not containing the justified checkpoint, which is essential for understanding actual fork choice behavior.\n\nThe partial synchrony treatment is a significant improvement over typical expositions, but several gaps remain. The manuscript correctly notes that safety holds under asynchrony while liveness requires partial synchrony, but doesn't explore the practical implications: What happens to validators who believe GST has occurred when it hasn't? How does the protocol handle clock skew between validators? The 12-second slot time and 4-second attestation deadline impose tight timing requirements that interact non-trivially with network delay assumptions.\n\nThe bouncing attack description is incomplete. The attack's effectiveness depends critically on the relationship between adversarial stake and the justification threshold - with exactly 1/3 adversarial stake, the attack can prevent finalization indefinitely, but the manuscript doesn't formalize this or discuss the FFG Liveness theorem's assumptions that rule out this scenario.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from discussing the formal verification efforts on Gasper (e.g., the Isabelle/HOL proofs) and their limitations, as well as the gap between the idealized protocol specification and the actual implementation in consensus clients.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "As a cryptography and blockchain security specialist, I'm impressed by the substantial improvements in this revision. The BLS12-381 treatment now includes essential implementation security considerations that were absent in Round 1. The rogue key attack mitigation through proof-of-possession is correctly explained, and the subgroup check requirements prevent a class of attacks that have affected other pairing-based systems in practice. The RANDAO bias analysis is particularly strong\u2014the quantitative bounds on last-revealer influence and the discussion of VDF mitigations demonstrate sophisticated understanding of the randomness generation problem.\n\nThe validator key architecture section is exemplary. The separation between hot BLS signing keys and cold withdrawal credentials is a critical security design that many treatments gloss over. Your coverage of slashing protection databases, including the specific data that must be tracked (source/target epochs, proposed slots), provides actionable guidance for implementers. The remote signer architecture discussion is valuable for understanding how institutional validators achieve security at scale.\n\nHowever, several cryptographic and security issues require attention. First, the manuscript is incomplete\u2014Section 7.2 cuts off mid-sentence, leaving the timing analysis unfinished. This is particularly problematic because timing assumptions are fundamental to the security model. Second, while you cover balancing attacks and proposer boost, you omit avalanche attacks, which exploit different aspects of LMD-GHOST. The avalanche attack (where an adversary releases withheld blocks to trigger cascading reorgs) has different mitigation requirements than balancing attacks. Third, the signature verification performance discussion is superficial. With ~900K attestations per epoch requiring verification, the computational bottleneck is real. Clients use sophisticated optimizations (batch verification with shared Miller loops, parallel verification across cores, signature caching) that deserve technical treatment.\n\nThe validator key rotation gap is a practical security concern. Validators occasionally need to rotate keys (compromised key material, hardware migration, custody changes), but the manuscript doesn't explain how to do this safely. The process involves voluntary exit, waiting for withdrawal, and re-depositing with new keys\u2014but there's a gap period where the validator is inactive. This has economic implications (missed rewards) and operational complexity (timing the rotation to minimize downtime) that warrant discussion.\n\nMinor technical corrections: In Section 3.1, you state 'O(n) pairings required' for different-message aggregation. While correct, modern implementations use batch verification techniques that amortize costs across multiple pairings, achieving better than naive O(n) performance. In Section 5.2, the correlation penalty formula should clarify that 'slashed_in_window' counts unique validators, not slashing events (a validator can only be slashed once). In Section 6.2, proposer boost is '40% of committee weight' but this should specify it's the committee assigned to that slot, not total stake\u2014this distinction matters for understanding attack costs.\n\nOverall, this is strong work that makes meaningful contributions to understanding Ethereum PoS security. The cryptographic foundations are now rigorous, the security analysis is thorough, and the practical considerations are valuable. Completing the truncated sections and addressing the identified gaps would elevate this to publication-ready status in a top-tier venue. The manuscript would benefit from a final technical review by consensus layer client developers to validate the implementation details and operational procedures.",

      "detailed_feedback": "As a cryptoeconomic mechanism design expert, I find this revision represents a significant leap in analytical rigor. The game-theoretic framework is now properly formalized with explicit utility functions, strategy spaces, and equilibrium characterization. The Nash equilibrium analysis of attestation strategies correctly identifies honest behavior as equilibrium under honest majority, though I appreciate the acknowledgment that this equilibrium is not unique - this nuance is often overlooked.\n\nThe MEV-Boost analysis is particularly strong, providing the three-party game model that was missing in earlier drafts. The treatment of builder competition driving bids toward extracted MEV is economically sound, and the discussion of relay trust assumptions correctly identifies a critical vulnerability in the current architecture. However, I would push further on the censorship resistance analysis - the manuscript mentions inclusion lists and enshrined PBS but doesn't provide the mechanism design details showing how these proposals alter the game-theoretic incentives. What are the specific incentive compatibility constraints that make censorship unprofitable?\n\nThe slashing economics section demonstrates excellent understanding of correlation penalties as a mechanism for distinguishing accidents from attacks. The $33B attack threshold calculation is valuable for contextualizing security assumptions. However, the analysis could be strengthened by modeling scenarios where attackers might rationally accept partial slashing. For instance, if an attacker controls 10% of validators and can extract $4B in external value (perhaps through a sophisticated cross-chain attack), the correlation penalty of ~30% of their stake (~$1B) might be acceptable. This suggests the mechanism's deterrence properties depend critically on the assumption that attackers cannot extract value exceeding their slashing costs.\n\nThe staking equilibrium analysis with yield curves and LSD dynamics is sophisticated and demonstrates strong understanding of reflexive market dynamics. The centralization metrics (Nakamoto coefficient ~3, HHI ~0.12) provide valuable quantitative context. However, the security implications of LSD concentration deserve deeper mechanism design analysis. The manuscript correctly identifies that Lido's ~29% market share approaches the 1/3 safety threshold, but doesn't fully analyze the attack vectors this creates. How exactly would an attacker compromise Lido governance? What are the specific mechanisms (token voting, operator selection, upgrade authority) that could be exploited? How do proposed mitigations (dual governance, distributed operators) change the attack game tree?\n\nThe inactivity leak mechanism is well-explained as a liveness guarantee, but the game-theoretic analysis could be more explicit about validator strategies during network partitions. The manuscript states validators on minority partitions face accelerating losses, but doesn't model the decision problem: when should a validator attempt to switch partitions versus exit versus wait? This is a dynamic game with incomplete information (validators don't know which partition will become majority) that deserves formal treatment.\n\nOne significant gap is the lack of empirical validation. While the theoretical analysis is sound, cryptoeconomic mechanism design requires empirical verification that actual behavior matches predicted equilibria. The manuscript would be substantially strengthened by including mainnet data analysis: Do validators actually achieve the predicted attestation accuracy rates? Is there evidence of strategic timing behavior in block proposals? How do MEV-Boost adoption rates vary with validator size, and does this match theoretical predictions about sophistication requirements for local building?\n\nThe fork choice analysis correctly identifies proposer boost as a mitigation for balancing attacks, but the game-theoretic analysis of the ex-ante reorg attack could be more rigorous. Under what conditions is it profitable for a proposer to attempt a reorg? The answer depends on the value of transactions being reorged, the probability of success (which depends on attestation timing), and the opportunity cost of the failed attempt. A formal expected utility calculation would strengthen this section.\n\nMinor technical note: The RANDAO bias analysis is correct but could be more precise about the economic implications. The manuscript states an adversary controlling 1% of validators has \"significant bias potential,\" but doesn't quantify the expected value of this bias. For most applications (proposer selection), the bias is worth at most one block's MEV (~0.05 ETH), which is far less than the cost of skipping slots. This suggests RANDAO bias is not currently a practical concern, though it could become one if VDF implementation is delayed indefinitely.\n\nOverall, this is now a strong manuscript that makes valuable contributions to understanding Ethereum's PoS cryptoeconomics. The mechanism design analysis is rigorous, the game-theoretic framework is properly formalized, and the treatment of MEV and slashing economics is sophisticated. With the suggested additions around empirical validation, advanced attack scenarios, and LSD governance mechanisms, this would be publication-ready for a top-tier venue. The work successfully bridges formal analysis with practical security considerations, which is exactly what the field needs.",

The reviewers collectively recognize the manuscript's strengths in formal specification of the partial synchrony model, rigorous cryptographic analysis (particularly BLS12-381 implementation details and RANDAO bias bounds), and sophisticated cryptoeconomic mechanism design including game-theoretic validator incentive analysis and MEV-Boost economics. The average score of 7.9 reflects a near-publication-ready work with specific addressable gaps.\n\nThe primary concerns center on three areas: (1) incomplete coverage of known Gasper composition vulnerabilities, particularly the avalanche attack and LMD-GHOST/Casper-FFG interaction issues documented in recent literature; (2) a truncated section (7.2) that requires completion with timing budget analysis; and (3) insufficient empirical validation of theoretical game-theoretic predictions against mainnet data.
