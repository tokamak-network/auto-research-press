## Introduction

Household air pollution from solid fuel combustion represents one of the world's most significant yet persistently underrecognized public health challenges, affecting approximately 2.4 billion people who rely on biomass fuels and coal for daily cooking and heating needs [1]. This exposure burden is not distributed equally across populations. Women in low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate share of indoor cooking smoke exposure, spending an average of three to seven hours daily in proximity to cooking fires [2]. This gendered exposure pattern reflects the intersection of traditional domestic roles, economic constraints, and structural inequalities that systematically place women at the center of household food preparation activities [3].

The public health significance of this exposure is substantial. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 estimates that household air pollution contributes to approximately 2.3 million premature deaths annually, with women accounting for approximately 58 percent of these deaths globally, though this proportion varies by region and age group [4,5]. Despite this considerable burden, indoor cooking smoke exposure remains inadequately integrated into both women's health and environmental health research agendas, resulting in critical knowledge gaps regarding exposure-response relationships, biological mechanisms, and effective intervention strategies [6].

The pollutant mixture generated by incomplete combustion of solid fuels is complex, comprising particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, benzene, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [7]. Peak indoor concentrations frequently exceed World Health Organization air quality guidelines by factors of ten to one hundred, creating exposure scenarios with profound implications for respiratory, cardiovascular, and reproductive health [8]. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the health impacts of indoor cooking smoke exposure among women, with particular attention to exposure characterization, biological mechanisms, and health outcomes across respiratory, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. We include child respiratory outcomes because maternal exposure during pregnancy affects offspring lung development, women bear primary caregiving responsibilities creating shared exposure environments, and child health outcomes directly affect women's wellbeing and economic productivity. We critically evaluate intervention approaches and highlight methodological considerations essential for advancing research equity and informing gender-responsive policy solutions.

## Background and Epidemiological Context

### Exposure Sources and Pollutant Characteristics

Household air pollution from cooking practices represents a complex environmental exposure characterized by incomplete combustion of diverse fuel sources. Biomass fuels including wood, agricultural crop residues, and animal dung constitute the primary energy source for approximately 2.4 billion people globally, with coal and kerosene serving as additional traditional fuels in specific geographic contexts [1]. These fuels, when burned in rudimentary cookstoves with poor ventilation, generate substantial indoor air pollution exceeding ambient air quality standards by orders of magnitude [9]. The pollutant mixture comprises particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), with indoor concentrations frequently reaching 300-3000 micrograms per cubic meter during cooking episodes, compared to World Health Organization 2021 guideline values of 15 micrograms per cubic meter for annual mean exposure [8,10]. Beyond particulate matter, the emissions profile includes carbon monoxide at concentrations of 5-50 parts per million, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds including benzene and formaldehyde, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene with established carcinogenic properties [7,11].

### Biological Mechanisms of Health Effects

The pathophysiological consequences of cooking smoke exposure operate through multiple interconnected biological pathways. Ultrafine particles and adsorbed chemical species penetrate deep into alveolar spaces, triggering oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species generation that overwhelms endogenous antioxidant defenses [12]. This oxidative imbalance initiates inflammatory cascades characterized by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, leading to sustained airway inflammation and progressive tissue remodeling [13]. The inflammatory response extends beyond local pulmonary effects to generate systemic inflammation, with elevated circulating inflammatory markers contributing to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic progression, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes [14]. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons undergo metabolic activation to DNA-reactive intermediates, forming carcinogenic adducts that initiate mutagenic processes underlying elevated lung cancer risk [15]. In pregnant women, particulate matter translocation and systemic inflammatory mediators disrupt fetal development through oxidative damage to placental tissues and altered nutrient transfer [16].

### Gendered Exposure Patterns and Intersecting Determinants

Women's disproportionate exposure to cooking smoke emerges from deeply entrenched gender norms that assign food preparation responsibilities exclusively to women across diverse cultural contexts. Time-activity pattern studies document that women spend 3-7 hours daily in cooking-related activities, with peak exposure concentrations occurring during meal preparation periods [2,17]. This gendered division of domestic labor intersects with multiple structural determinants to amplify vulnerability. Rural women in low-income settings face compounded exposure through limited access to clean fuels, inadequate housing ventilation, and fuel stacking behaviors where traditional and transitional fuels are used simultaneously based on seasonal availability and economic constraints [18]. The higher disease burden in women primarily reflects these exposure differentials rather than established sex-based differences in biological susceptibility; available evidence suggests similar exposure-response relationships in men and women for COPD and cardiovascular outcomes when exposure is equivalently measured [19].

## Methodology

### Evidence Synthesis Approach

We conducted a narrative review of published epidemiological evidence on household air pollution from cooking and women's health outcomes. We prioritized recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses, cohort studies, and global burden of disease assessments published 2010-2024, searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using terms related to household air pollution, cooking fuels, biomass combustion, and health outcomes across respiratory, cardiovascular, and reproductive domains. This narrative synthesis aims to integrate evidence across multiple health domains rather than provide original pooled estimates; all effect estimates reported are drawn from cited source studies and systematic reviews.

### Methodological Considerations and Bias Assessment

The evidence base exhibits notable heterogeneity in exposure assessment methodologies, creating important considerations for interpretation. Fuel-type proxies (primary cooking fuel) introduce substantial non-differential misclassification, likely biasing effect estimates toward the null and thus underestimating true associations [20]. Fuel stacking—concurrent use of multiple fuels—further complicates exposure classification. Most high-quality studies adjusted for socioeconomic indicators (education, household wealth), tobacco smoking, ambient air pollution, and occupational exposures; however, residual confounding by unmeasured socioeconomic dimensions remains likely, potentially overestimating household air pollution effects [21]. Cross-sectional COPD studies may underestimate effects through healthy worker survivor bias if severely affected women exit cooking roles or die prematurely. Outcome ascertainment varies substantially, with diagnostic criteria developed primarily in high-income populations potentially lacking sensitivity for exposure profiles characteristic of biomass smoke exposure [22].

## Results: Health Impacts Across Multiple Domains

### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Evidence quality for COPD in never-smoking women is MODERATE based on consistent findings across multiple cohorts, clear dose-response relationships, and strong biological plausibility, though residual confounding remains possible. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Kurmi et al. found that biomass fuel users demonstrated 2.44-fold elevated COPD risk (95% CI: 1.92-3.11) compared to clean fuel users after adjusting for smoking and other confounders [23]. Hu et al. reported similar findings with pooled odds ratio of 2.52 (95% CI: 1.88-3.38) for women using solid fuels [24]. Spirometric assessments reveal accelerated lung function decline, with exposed women experiencing annual FEV1 reductions of 38-52 mL compared to 22-28 mL in unexposed populations [25]. Cumulative exposure metrics exhibit clear dose-response gradients; women with greater than 50 hour-years of biomass cooking exposure showed COPD prevalence exceeding 35 percent compared to 8 percent in those with minimal exposure [26].

### Acute Respiratory Infections in Children

Exposure to cooking smoke demonstrates consistent associations with acute respiratory infections in children under five years, relevant to women's health through shared exposure environments and caregiving burden. Meta-analyses by Dherani et al. revealed pooled odds ratios of 1.78 (95% CI: 1.45-2.18) for pneumonia in children residing in households using solid fuels [27]. In South Asia, household air pollution accounts for approximately 28 percent of pneumonia deaths in children under five according to GBD 2019 estimates, though this proportion varies substantially by region and modeling assumptions [4].

### Cardiovascular Health Impacts

Evidence quality for cardiovascular outcomes is LOW-to-MODERATE given fewer studies, greater heterogeneity, and potential confounding by correlated risk factors. A systematic review by Fatmi and Coggon found biomass fuel users exhibited 1.48-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.23-1.78) for ischemic heart disease [28]. Lee et al. reported elevated stroke risk with pooled relative risk of 1.34 (95% CI: 1.12-1.61) [29]. Blood pressure measurements reveal 4-8 mmHg higher systolic pressures among exposed women, with chronic exposure associated with hypertension prevalence increases of 35-50 percent [30]. Biomarker studies document elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen levels in exposed populations, supporting inflammatory pathways linking air pollution to cardiovascular pathogenesis [14].

### Reproductive and Maternal Health Outcomes

Evidence quality for adverse birth outcomes is MODERATE based on consistent associations across settings, though exposure timing and critical windows remain incompletely characterized. Pope et al.'s meta-analysis found biomass fuel use during pregnancy associated with 86-gram reductions in birth weight (95% CI: 55-117 grams) and 1.51-fold increased stillbirth risk (95% CI: 1.23-1.85) [31]. Amegah et al. reported pooled odds ratio of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.18-1.41) for low birth weight [32]. Maternal health impacts include elevated risks of pregnancy-induced hypertension and anemia, compounding existing vulnerabilities in resource-limited settings [33].

### Lung Cancer

Epidemiological evidence links cooking smoke exposure to elevated lung cancer risk among never-smoking women. A meta-analysis by Bruce et al. yielded pooled odds ratio of 1.95 (95% CI: 1.16-3.27) for lung cancer associated with long-term biomass fuel use [34]. Associations strengthen with increasing exposure duration, with women cooking with biomass fuels for more than 40 years demonstrating approximately 3-fold elevated risk [35].

## Discussion

### Interpretation and Public Health Significance

This narrative synthesis establishes household air pollution from cooking as a major contributor to women's disease burden globally, with evidence demonstrating significant associations across respiratory, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. The documented respiratory effects align with established mechanisms of particulate matter toxicity and inflammatory pathway activation [12,13]. The disproportionate burden on women reflects structural determinants of exposure—gendered division of domestic labor, economic constraints, and limited decision-making autonomy—rather than inherent biological vulnerability [3,19].

### Critical Evaluation of Intervention Strategies

Evidence increasingly demonstrates that "improved" biomass cookstoves, while reducing emissions relative to traditional stoves, rarely achieve PM2.5 reductions to WHO guideline levels or deliver sustained health benefits in field conditions [36]. The HAPIN trial—a randomized controlled trial across Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda—found that improved biomass stoves reduced kitchen PM2.5 concentrations but did not significantly reduce personal exposures or improve primary health outcomes including birth weight and childhood pneumonia [37]. Field studies demonstrate that improved biomass stoves typically reduce personal PM2.5 exposures by 20-50 percent but rarely achieve WHO guideline levels of 15 μg/m³ annual mean [38]. Clean fuel transitions (LPG, electricity, biogas) can reduce personal exposures by 70-90 percent, approaching guideline levels when used exclusively [39].

### Policy Implications and Health Equity

Addressing this preventable health burden requires gender-responsive policies recognizing cooking-related air pollution as a structural determinant of health inequity. Effective policy instruments include: targeted subsidies (means-tested or categorical) for clean fuels; results-based financing tied to sustained adoption and exposure reduction; social protection linkages integrating clean cooking access with conditional cash transfer programs; supply chain development and last-mile distribution infrastructure; standards and certification systems ensuring stove and fuel quality; and gender-responsive financing mechanisms ensuring women's control over household energy decisions [40,41]. Programs must avoid regressive subsidy incidence and prevent exclusion of poorest households. The WHO 2021 guidelines on household fuel combustion provide emission rate targets that only clean fuels and technologies reliably meet [10].

## Conclusion

Indoor cooking smoke represents a substantial, preventable health burden affecting 2.4 billion people globally, with women disproportionately exposed through intersecting structural inequalities [1,4]. Evidence demonstrates significant respiratory, cardiovascular, and reproductive health impacts, with MODERATE certainty for COPD and adverse birth outcomes and LOW-to-MODERATE certainty for cardiovascular effects. Addressing this crisis requires transitions to truly clean fuels rather than incremental improved biomass stoves, supported by gender-responsive policies addressing affordability, infrastructure, and women's decision-making autonomy. Research priorities include developing validated exposure assessment methodologies, conducting implementation science evaluating clean fuel transitions, and ensuring gender-disaggregated outcome analysis.
