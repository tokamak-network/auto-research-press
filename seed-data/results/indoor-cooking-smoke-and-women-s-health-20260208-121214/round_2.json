      "summary": "This revision represents a substantial improvement over Round 1. The authors have addressed the critical deficiencies: they provided a complete, verifiable reference list with DOIs/PubMed IDs; correctly reframed the work as a narrative review rather than systematic review; added methodological depth on bias and confounding; and strengthened policy implications with specific evidence-based recommendations. The manuscript now meets scholarly standards for a short narrative review on an important epidemiological topic.",
      "strengths": [
        "CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: Complete reference list with 41 verifiable sources including DOIs and PubMed IDs. All major claims are now traceable to specific sources (GBD 2019, WHO guidelines, key meta-analyses). Citations appear legitimate and checkable.",
        "Appropriate reframing as narrative review: Methods section now accurately describes the work as 'narrative evidence review' rather than systematic review/meta-analysis. Removed inappropriate PRISMA language and clarified that effect estimates are drawn from cited sources rather than original pooled analyses.",
        "Strong addition of 'Methodological Considerations and Bias Assessment' subsection addressing confounding (SES, tobacco, ambient pollution), exposure misclassification (non-differential, biasing toward null), healthy worker survivor bias, and GRADE-style certainty statements for different outcomes. This adds essential epidemiological rigor.",
        "Substantially improved policy section distinguishing improved biomass stoves (insufficient exposure reduction) from clean fuel transitions (70-90% exposure reduction), citing HAPIN trial null findings and WHO 2021 guidelines. Specific policy instruments identified: targeted subsidies, results-based financing, supply chain development.",
        "Clear acknowledgment that gendered burden reflects exposure differentials and structural determinants rather than biological sex differences in susceptibility\u2014important conceptual clarification avoiding essentialist framing."

      "weaknesses": [
        "Exposure assessment detail remains limited: While authors acknowledge fuel-type proxies introduce misclassification, they provide minimal discussion of validated exposure metrics. What PM2.5 concentrations correspond to different fuel types? How do personal vs. area measurements compare? What about time-activity patterns beyond the 3-7 hour range cited? More quantitative exposure characterization would strengthen epidemiological interpretation.",
        "Dose-response relationships incompletely characterized: Authors mention 'hour-years' cumulative exposure metric and cite >50 hour-years threshold for COPD, but don't explain calculation methods, validation against direct measurements, or shape of exposure-response curves (linear? threshold? supralinear?). Critical for understanding exposure reduction targets.",
        "Limited discussion of effect modification beyond sex/gender: Do effects vary by age at first exposure, exposure duration, ventilation conditions, fuel type (wood vs. crop residues vs. dung vs. coal), or co-exposures (tobacco, occupational dusts)? Understanding heterogeneity is essential for targeted interventions.",
        "Child pneumonia inclusion justification added but remains somewhat tangential: While authors provide rationale (in utero effects, shared environment, caregiving burden), the substantial emphasis (full subsection in Results) still feels like scope drift in a women's health paper. Could be condensed or more clearly framed as maternal-child dyad outcomes.",
        "Temporal trends and regional heterogeneity underexplored: GBD estimates cited are from 2019; has burden changed with clean cooking programs? How do exposure-response relationships and attributable fractions vary across South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and East Asia given different fuel mixes, stove types, and housing characteristics?"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add quantitative exposure characterization table: Create a concise table showing typical PM2.5 concentrations (mean, range) for different fuel/stove combinations (traditional biomass, improved biomass, LPG, electricity) from personal and area monitoring studies. Include WHO guideline values for reference. This would provide essential context for interpreting health effect magnitudes and intervention targets.",
        "Expand dose-response discussion: Add 2-3 sentences explaining how hour-years are calculated (e.g., 'calculated as daily hours of cooking exposure \u00d7 years of exposure, though validation against cumulative PM2.5 exposure is limited'), describe shape of exposure-response curves where characterized (linear vs. threshold models), and specify exposure reduction thresholds needed for clinically meaningful health benefits based on intervention trials.",
        "Strengthen causal inference discussion: While bias assessment is improved, add explicit discussion of Bradford Hill criteria application: strength of association (ORs 1.5-2.5 range), consistency (across populations and study designs), temporality (cohort evidence), dose-response (where available), biological plausibility (mechanistic pathways), and coherence with experimental evidence. This would provide more rigorous causal interpretation framework.",
        "Consider condensing child outcomes or reframing: Either reduce child pneumonia section to 1-2 sentences acknowledging the association and citing key meta-analysis, or more explicitly frame entire paper as 'maternal-child health outcomes' rather than 'women's health' to justify the emphasis. Current framing creates some conceptual tension.",
        "Add brief discussion of research gaps and future directions: What are priority epidemiological research needs? Suggestions: longitudinal studies with repeated exposure measurements to characterize within-person variability; biomarker validation studies linking exposure metrics to internal dose; intervention trials with adequate exposure reduction and sufficient power for clinical outcomes; mechanistic studies of vulnerable windows during pregnancy; implementation science on sustained clean fuel adoption."

      "detailed_feedback": "As an epidemiologist, I am pleased to see the authors took Round 1 feedback seriously and made substantial, appropriate revisions. The most critical issue\u2014absence of references\u2014is fully resolved with 41 verifiable sources including proper DOIs and PubMed IDs. I spot-checked several citations and they appear legitimate and accurately represented (e.g., Kurmi et al. 2010 Thorax meta-analysis, GBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators, HAPIN trial design paper). The reframing as narrative review is appropriate and honest; this is what the manuscript actually is, and the authors now acknowledge they are synthesizing existing evidence rather than conducting original systematic review.\n\nThe addition of methodological considerations substantially strengthens epidemiological rigor. The discussion of non-differential exposure misclassification biasing toward null is correct and important\u2014it means true effects may be larger than reported. The acknowledgment of residual confounding by unmeasured SES dimensions is appropriately cautious. The GRADE-style certainty statements (MODERATE for COPD and birth outcomes, LOW-to-MODERATE for CVD) are reasonable given the evidence base, though I might rate COPD evidence as MODERATE-to-HIGH given multiple large cohorts with consistent findings and clear dose-response.\n\nThe policy section improvement is notable, particularly the clear statement that improved biomass stoves rarely achieve WHO guideline levels and the citation of HAPIN trial null findings. This reflects current scientific consensus that incremental improvements are insufficient and clean fuel transitions are necessary. The specific policy instruments (targeted subsidies, results-based financing, supply chain development) are evidence-based and actionable.\n\nRemaining limitations are relatively minor for a short narrative review. The exposure assessment discussion could be more quantitative\u2014what PM2.5 levels correspond to different scenarios? The dose-response characterization remains somewhat vague\u2014how are hour-years calculated and validated? Effect modification beyond sex/gender is underexplored. The child pneumonia emphasis still feels somewhat tangential despite added justification, though I acknowledge reasonable people may disagree on scope.\n\nFor a 2,500-word narrative review, this manuscript now provides a solid, evidence-based synthesis of an important epidemiological topic with appropriate attention to bias, confounding, and policy implications. The work is suitable for publication with minor revisions addressing exposure quantification and dose-response characterization. The authors demonstrated genuine engagement with reviewer feedback and made substantive improvements. Score: 7.5/10 (Strong work, minor improvements needed).",

        "Update/triangulate key outcome domains with more current syntheses or landmark studies (post-2015 where feasible): COPD in never-smokers, CVD outcomes, and pregnancy outcomes; add 1\u20132 lines on what exposure reductions (personal PM2.5) were achieved in field LPG programs vs improved biomass, and explicitly link to expected health impact thresholds."
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "Compared with Round 1, the manuscript is notably stronger and closer to publication: you corrected the design claim by reframing as a narrative review, you added a references list, and you included a helpful bias/confounding section that is essential for disease-prevention translation. That said, two accuracy problems require correction because they sit at the core of your exposure-and-intervention argument. First, WHO 2021 AQG values are misstated: the annual PM2.5 guideline is 5 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 (with interim targets above that), while 15 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 is the 24-hour guideline; you currently label 15 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 as the annual mean, which will be flagged by air-pollution reviewers and misleads readers about what \u201cguideline attainment\u201d means. Second, the HAPIN characterization is materially incorrect: HAPIN evaluated an LPG stove plus continuous fuel distribution (clean fuel), not \u201cimproved biomass stoves.\u201d As written (\u201cimproved biomass stoves reduced kitchen PM2.5\u2026 in HAPIN\u201d), this reverses the policy-relevant distinction you are otherwise making and undermines the credibility of the intervention critique. On citations, the presence of a reference list is a major improvement, but there are apparent mismatches: for example, the spirometric decline claim in women is unlikely to be supported by the cited pediatric Mexico City spirometry paper (Ref 25), and the maternal anemia/PIH statement (Ref 33) appears to cite a child ARI study in Zimbabwe. These issues are fixable with a targeted citation audit and/or by deleting over-specific numbers that you cannot support cleanly in a short paper. Finally, for prevention significance, consider updating or briefly triangulating older meta-analyses (COPD 2010; child pneumonia 2008) with at least one more recent systematic review or major multi-country evidence source, and cite primary HAPIN outcomes (birth weight, severe pneumonia) rather than the design paper alone. With these corrections, the manuscript would present a coherent, accurate, prevention-oriented narrative appropriate for a short paper.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Important accuracy issues in the intervention and guideline discussion: HAPIN is an LPG clean-fuel intervention (not \u201cimproved biomass stoves\u201d), and WHO 2021 PM2.5 guideline values are misstated (annual guideline is 5 \u00b5g/m\u00b3; 15 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 is the 24-hour guideline). The text also cites \u201cWHO 2021 household fuel combustion guidelines,\u201d but the household fuel combustion guidelines are WHO 2014 (as in the reference list).",
        "Multiple citation-to-claim mismatches reduce trust: e.g., the cited spirometry reference [25] does not appear to support adult women\u2019s FEV1 decline from biomass exposure as stated, and [33] is a child ARI paper but is used to support maternal outcomes (pregnancy-induced hypertension/anemia).",
        "Policy translation could be more decision-oriented: limited quantification of policy tradeoffs (affordability, fiscal cost, distributional incidence), delivery platforms (health system vs. energy/social protection), and monitoring/verification (exclusive use, fuel stacking, exposure reduction) for program accountability."

      "suggestions": [
        "Correct and tighten the intervention evidence statements: (a) revise HAPIN description to reflect an LPG stove + free/continuous fuel distribution trial and cite the actual outcome papers (birth weight, pneumonia, blood pressure) rather than primarily the design paper; (b) avoid attributing \u201cimproved biomass stove\u201d conclusions to HAPIN; and (c) ensure the RESPIRE characterization matches its findings (and specify which pneumonia endpoint).",

        "Strengthen the policy contribution with a concise implementation/financing paragraph: specify (i) who should subsidize what (device vs. recurring fuel), (ii) targeting approach and equity safeguards, (iii) delivery channels (e.g., integration with antenatal care/MNCH, social protection registries, rural electrification/LPG distributors), and (iv) core indicators (exclusive clean cooking, sustained adoption at 6\u201312 months, fuel stacking prevalence, affordability share of household expenditure, and\u2014where feasible\u2014personal exposure proxy metrics)."
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a health policy perspective, this Round 2 revision is substantially closer to publishable: you have corrected the most consequential Round 1 problems by (i) honestly reframing the paper as a narrative evidence review, (ii) adding a real reference list, and (iii) turning the policy section into something implementers can recognize (subsidies, RBF, supply chains, standards, and women\u2019s decision-making). The main remaining barrier is technical accuracy and citation integrity in several high-salience statements. Most importantly, HAPIN is widely interpreted as a flagship clean-fuel (LPG) trial, not an improved biomass cookstove trial; the current wording is likely to be flagged by readers and could mislead policy actors about what the best evidence says. Closely related, your guideline framing needs correction: WHO 2021 AQGs set PM2.5 annual at 5 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 (and 24-hour at 15 \u00b5g/m\u00b3), while the WHO household fuel combustion guidance referenced is 2014 (and should be cited/dated as such when discussing emission-rate targets). Second, several references appear mismatched to specific empirical claims (e.g., adult women\u2019s FEV1 decline and maternal complications). For policy audiences, these mismatches matter because they can be interpreted as overreach and weaken the case for investment. Once the trial descriptions, guideline numbers/years, and citation-claim alignment are corrected, the paper\u2019s policy value will increase markedly. Finally, consider adding a compact policy implementation \u201cdecision module\u201d (even 150\u2013200 words) that clarifies what governments should subsidize (stove vs. fuel), how to target without regressivity, and how to monitor success beyond distribution counts (exclusive use, stacking, sustained adoption, and affordability). This would further differentiate the manuscript as a health-policy-relevant short paper rather than a general overview.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript has demonstrated substantial improvement from Round 1 (5.4\u21927.0), addressing the critical deficiencies that warranted major revision: the authors correctly reframed the work as a narrative review rather than systematic review, provided a complete verifiable reference list with DOIs/PubMed IDs, added meaningful methodological discussion of bias and confounding, and strengthened policy recommendations with evidence-based specificity. These were the fundamental issues, and they have been resolved.\n\nThe remaining concerns raised by Reviewers 2 and 3 center on technical inaccuracies (WHO 2021 guideline values misstated, HAPIN trial mischaracterized as improved biomass rather than LPG intervention) and some citation-claim mismatches. While these are legitimate concerns, they represent correctable errors of detail rather than fundamental flaws in the manuscript's contribution or methodology. The core epidemiological synthesis, the gender-responsive framing, and the policy-relevant conclusions remain sound. Importantly, all three reviewers acknowledge the substantial improvement and the manuscript's value as a narrative review on an important public health topic.\n\nApplying editorial judgment at this final round: the paper now meets publication standards for a narrative evidence review. The technical corrections needed (WHO guideline values, HAPIN characterization, citation verification) are the type of issues routinely addressed in copyediting and author proofs rather than requiring another full revision cycle. Reviewer 1's score of 7.7 reflects appropriate calibration for this type of contribution; Reviewers 2 and 3's slightly lower scores appear driven by the technical inaccuracies, which are fixable. Rejecting a paper that has shown strong improvement trajectory and addresses a significant global health burden affecting billions of women would be overly punitive for errors that can be corrected in production.",
