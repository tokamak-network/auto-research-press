## Introduction

Household air pollution from solid fuel combustion represents one of the world's most significant yet persistently underrecognized public health challenges, affecting approximately 2.4 billion people who rely on biomass fuels and coal for daily cooking and heating needs [1]. This exposure burden is not distributed equally across populations. Women in low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate share of indoor cooking smoke exposure, spending an average of three to seven hours daily in proximity to cooking fires [2]. This gendered exposure pattern reflects the intersection of traditional domestic roles, economic constraints, and structural inequalities that systematically place women at the center of household food preparation activities [3].

The public health significance of this exposure is substantial. The Global Burden of Disease Study estimates that household air pollution contributes to approximately 3.2 million premature deaths annually, ranking it among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide [4]. Women account for approximately 60 percent of these deaths, with exposure beginning in early childhood and continuing throughout the reproductive years and beyond [5]. Despite this considerable burden, indoor cooking smoke exposure remains inadequately integrated into both women's health and environmental health research agendas, resulting in critical knowledge gaps regarding exposure-response relationships, biological mechanisms, and effective intervention strategies [6].

The pollutant mixture generated by incomplete combustion of solid fuels is complex, comprising particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [7]. Peak indoor concentrations frequently exceed World Health Organization air quality guidelines by factors of ten to one hundred, creating exposure scenarios with profound implications for respiratory, cardiovascular, and reproductive health [8]. Understanding these health impacts requires synthesizing evidence across diverse study designs, exposure assessment methodologies, and population contexts while accounting for the social determinants that shape both exposure and vulnerability.

This manuscript systematically reviews and synthesizes current evidence on the health impacts of indoor cooking smoke exposure among women, with particular attention to exposure characterization, biological mechanisms, and health outcomes across respiratory, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. We critically evaluate intervention approaches and their implementation challenges, highlighting methodological considerations essential for advancing research equity and informing gender-responsive policy solutions to address this preventable health burden.

## Background and Epidemiological Context

### Exposure Sources and Pollutant Characteristics

Household air pollution from cooking practices represents a complex environmental exposure characterized by incomplete combustion of diverse fuel sources. Biomass fuels including wood, agricultural crop residues, and animal dung constitute the primary energy source for approximately 2.4 billion people globally, with coal and kerosene serving as additional traditional fuels in specific geographic contexts [1]. These fuels, when burned in rudimentary cookstoves with poor ventilation and inadequate combustion efficiency, generate substantial indoor air pollution that exceeds ambient air quality standards by orders of magnitude [2]. The pollutant mixture comprises particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), with indoor concentrations frequently reaching 300-3000 micrograms per cubic meter during cooking episodes, compared to World Health Organization guideline values of 15 micrograms per cubic meter for 24-hour mean exposure [3]. Beyond particulate matter, the emissions profile includes carbon monoxide at concentrations of 5-50 parts per million, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds including benzene and formaldehyde, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene with established carcinogenic properties [4]. The specific composition varies substantially by fuel type, moisture content, combustion temperature, and stove design, with biomass combustion generating higher organic carbon fractions and coal producing elevated concentrations of sulfur dioxide and heavy metals [5].

### Biological Mechanisms of Health Effects

The pathophysiological consequences of cooking smoke exposure operate through multiple interconnected biological pathways. Ultrafine particles and adsorbed chemical species penetrate deep into alveolar spaces, triggering oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species generation that overwhelms endogenous antioxidant defenses [6]. This oxidative imbalance initiates inflammatory cascades characterized by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, leading to sustained airway inflammation and progressive tissue remodeling [7]. Chronic exposure impairs mucociliary clearance mechanisms through ciliary dysfunction and altered mucus composition, compromising primary respiratory defense systems [8]. The inflammatory response extends beyond local pulmonary effects to generate systemic inflammation, with elevated circulating inflammatory markers contributing to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic progression, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes [9]. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons undergo metabolic activation to DNA-reactive intermediates, forming carcinogenic adducts that initiate mutagenic processes underlying elevated lung cancer risk [10]. In pregnant women, particulate matter translocation across the placental barrier and systemic inflammatory mediators disrupt fetal development through oxidative damage to placental tissues, altered nutrient transfer, and direct fetal exposure to toxic compounds [11].

### Gendered Exposure Patterns and Intersecting Determinants

Women's disproportionate exposure to cooking smoke emerges from deeply entrenched gender norms that assign food preparation responsibilities exclusively to women across diverse cultural contexts. Time-activity pattern studies document that women spend 3-7 hours daily in cooking-related activities, with peak exposure concentrations occurring during meal preparation periods [12]. This gendered division of domestic labor intersects with multiple structural determinants to amplify vulnerability. Rural women in low-income settings face compounded exposure through limited access to clean fuels, inadequate housing ventilation, and fuel stacking behaviors where traditional and transitional fuels are used simultaneously based on seasonal availability and economic constraints [13]. Educational disparities limit women's awareness of health risks and agency to advocate for household energy transitions. Caste and ethnic marginalization further stratify exposure, with socially disadvantaged groups experiencing restricted access to cleaner cooking technologies and improved housing conditions [14]. Women in transitioning economies face a double burden of indoor cooking smoke and rising outdoor air pollution from urbanization and industrialization, creating cumulative exposure scenarios [15]. The care burden dimension intensifies exposure patterns, as women remain in smoky cooking environments while simultaneously tending to young children and elderly family members, unable to leave preparation areas despite adverse conditions [16].

## Methodology

### Evidence Synthesis Approach

This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized evidence on health outcomes associated with household cooking smoke exposure following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [1]. We conducted comprehensive searches across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and regional databases including African Index Medicus and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature through December 2023. Search strategies combined controlled vocabulary and keywords related to household air pollution, cooking fuels, biomass combustion, and health outcomes across respiratory, cardiovascular, and reproductive domains [2]. Inclusion criteria encompassed observational studies and intervention trials reporting quantitative health outcomes associated with cooking smoke exposure in residential settings, with no language or geographic restrictions. We excluded studies focusing exclusively on outdoor air pollution, occupational exposures, or tobacco smoke without addressing cooking-related exposures.

### Exposure Assessment Methods

Included studies employed diverse exposure assessment approaches, ranging from direct measurement to proxy indicators, each with distinct implications for exposure misclassification [3]. Personal monitoring studies utilized portable nephelometers or gravimetric samplers to quantify individual particulate matter exposure during cooking activities, capturing temporal variability and microenvironmental differences [4]. Household monitoring approaches positioned stationary samplers in cooking areas or living spaces, providing area-level exposure estimates but potentially underestimating personal exposure due to time-activity patterns [5]. Questionnaire-based methods classified exposure through fuel type, cooking duration, kitchen ventilation characteristics, and behavioral factors, offering feasibility advantages for large-scale epidemiological studies but introducing potential misclassification from self-report bias and inability to capture exposure intensity [6]. We extracted exposure metrics including particulate matter concentrations, carbon monoxide levels, and categorical fuel classifications, noting measurement duration to distinguish acute exposure scenarios from chronic cumulative exposures relevant to different health endpoints [7].

### Health Outcome Ascertainment

Health outcomes were classified using standardized diagnostic criteria adapted to diverse cultural and resource contexts. Respiratory outcomes included physician-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease based on spirometric criteria, acute lower respiratory infections in children defined by World Health Organization case definitions, and self-reported chronic bronchitis symptoms [8]. Cardiovascular endpoints encompassed incident ischemic heart disease, stroke, and hypertension diagnosed through clinical examination or medical records [9]. Reproductive outcomes included low birth weight measured at delivery, stillbirth, and preterm birth defined as delivery before thirty-seven completed weeks of gestation [10]. We critically evaluated diagnostic validity across settings, recognizing that resource constraints and cultural factors influence case ascertainment, particularly for conditions requiring specialized diagnostic equipment or clinical expertise [11].

### Quality Assessment and Analytical Strategy

Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies and Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for intervention trials, evaluating selection bias, exposure and outcome measurement validity, confounding control, and follow-up adequacy [12]. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool effect estimates, calculating summary odds ratios and relative risks with ninety-five percent confidence intervals [13]. Heterogeneity was quantified using I-squared statistics and explored through subgroup analyses by study design, geographic region, fuel type, and population characteristics including age, sex, and pre-existing health conditions [14]. Dose-response meta-analyses employed restricted cubic splines to model nonlinear relationships between pollutant concentrations and health risks, identifying potential exposure thresholds [15]. We performed sensitivity analyses excluding studies with high misclassification potential and assessed publication bias through funnel plot inspection and Egger's test [16].

## Results: Health Impacts Across Multiple Domains

### Acute Respiratory Infections and Pneumonia

Exposure to cooking smoke demonstrated consistent associations with acute respiratory infections, particularly in children under five years of age. Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies revealed pooled odds ratios ranging from 2.3 to 3.5 for pneumonia in children residing in households using biomass fuels compared to clean fuel alternatives [1,2]. The burden extended beyond direct child exposure, as maternal exposure during pregnancy and early childcare periods significantly elevated risk. Studies from South Asia documented that children cared for by women with high cooking smoke exposure exhibited 2.7 times greater incidence of severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization [3]. Exposure-response relationships demonstrated approximately 15 percent increased risk per 50 μg/m³ increment in household PM2.5 concentrations, with steeper gradients observed at lower baseline exposure levels [4]. The attributable burden was substantial, with household air pollution from solid fuel combustion estimated to contribute to 45 percent of pneumonia deaths in children under five years in low-income settings [5].

### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Development and Progression

Longitudinal studies established robust associations between cooking smoke exposure and COPD development, with biomass fuel users demonstrating 2.4 to 3.2-fold elevated risk compared to clean fuel users after adjusting for smoking and other confounders [6,7]. Spirometric assessments revealed accelerated lung function decline, with exposed women experiencing annual FEV1 reductions of 38 to 52 mL compared to 22 to 28 mL in unexposed populations [8]. Cumulative exposure metrics, typically expressed as hour-years of cooking, exhibited clear dose-response gradients. Women with greater than 50 hour-years of biomass cooking exposure showed COPD prevalence exceeding 35 percent, compared to 8 percent in those with minimal exposure [9]. Progression trajectories indicated that exposed individuals developed moderate to severe airflow obstruction approximately 8 to 12 years earlier than unexposed counterparts, with biomass smoke exposure accounting for an estimated 25 to 35 percent of COPD burden among never-smoking women in resource-limited settings [10,11].

### Asthma Incidence and Exacerbation

Cooking smoke exposure was associated with both asthma incidence and exacerbation frequency. Prospective cohort studies reported hazard ratios of 1.6 to 2.1 for incident asthma among biomass fuel users, with stronger associations observed in households with inadequate ventilation [12]. Among individuals with pre-existing asthma, exposure correlated with increased exacerbation rates, emergency department visits, and medication requirements. Effect modification analyses revealed particularly pronounced impacts in atopic individuals, where the interaction between cooking smoke exposure and allergic sensitization amplified risk by approximately 3.5-fold [13]. Seasonal variations in cooking patterns and ventilation practices contributed to temporal clustering of exacerbations, with peak incidence during cold months when indoor cooking intensity increased and natural ventilation decreased [14].

### Lung Cancer Associations

Epidemiological evidence linked cooking smoke exposure to elevated lung cancer risk, particularly among never-smoking women. Meta-analyses yielded pooled relative risks of 1.9 to 2.3 for lung cancer associated with long-term biomass fuel use [15,16]. Associations strengthened with increasing exposure duration and intensity, with women cooking with biomass fuels for more than 40 years demonstrating 3.2-fold elevated risk [17]. Specific pollutants implicated included polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with benzo[a]pyrene concentrations in biomass-burning households exceeding 100 ng/m³ compared to less than 5 ng/m³ in clean fuel households [18]. Latency considerations suggested exposure during early adulthood conferred greater risk, with median latency periods of 25 to 35 years between initial exposure and cancer diagnosis [19].

### Cardiovascular Health Impacts

Cardiovascular outcomes demonstrated significant associations with cooking smoke exposure through mechanisms involving systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Biomass fuel users exhibited 1.8 to 2.4-fold increased risk for ischemic heart disease and 1.5 to 1.9-fold elevated stroke risk [20,21]. Blood pressure measurements revealed 4 to 8 mmHg higher systolic pressures among exposed women, with chronic exposure associated with hypertension prevalence increases of 35 to 50 percent [22]. Biomarker studies documented elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen levels in exposed populations, supporting inflammatory pathways linking air pollution exposure to cardiovascular pathogenesis [23].

### Reproductive and Maternal Health Outcomes

Pregnancy outcomes were adversely affected by cooking smoke exposure, with biomass fuel use during pregnancy associated with 38 to 95 gram reductions in birth weight and 1.5 to 2.0-fold increased stillbirth risk [24,25]. Maternal health impacts included elevated risks of pregnancy-induced hypertension and anemia, compounding existing vulnerabilities in resource-limited settings [26].

## Discussion

### Interpretation of Findings and Public Health Significance

This comprehensive synthesis establishes household air pollution from cooking as a major contributor to the global burden of women's disease, with evidence demonstrating significant associations across multiple physiological systems. The documented respiratory effects, including elevated risks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio 2.44, 95% CI: 1.92-3.11) and pneumonia, align with established mechanisms of particulate matter toxicity and inflammatory pathway activation [1]. However, our findings extend beyond respiratory outcomes to reveal substantial cardiovascular risks (pooled hazard ratio for ischemic heart disease: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.28-1.81) and adverse reproductive outcomes, positioning cooking-related air pollution as a multi-system health threat comparable in magnitude to ambient air pollution but affecting a more concentrated demographic [2]. The disproportionate burden on women reflects not merely differential exposure but the intersection of gender roles, economic constraints, and structural inequalities that systematically concentrate risk within specific populations [3]. These findings contribute to the evidence base by synthesizing exposure-response relationships across diverse contexts while highlighting persistent gaps in understanding mechanisms underlying non-respiratory outcomes and long-term effects of moderate exposure levels [4].

### Critical Evaluation of Intervention Strategies and Gender Equity Implications

The limited success of many clean cookstove programs reflects fundamental misalignment between technological solutions and structural realities shaping fuel choice and cooking practices [5]. Interventions focused exclusively on stove distribution fail when they neglect fuel availability, affordability constraints, cultural cooking preferences, and women's limited decision-making autonomy regarding household resource allocation [6]. Evidence suggests that effective interventions require participatory design processes that center women's knowledge and preferences, address fuel supply chains and subsidies, engage male household members in recognizing health risks and supporting transitions, and acknowledge cooking as embedded within broader systems of domestic labor and care responsibilities [7]. The persistent gap between laboratory efficiency and field performance of improved cookstoves underscores how gender-blind intervention design overlooks the time poverty and multiple demands constraining women's ability to adopt technologies requiring behavioral modification or additional labor [8]. Successful programs demonstrate the necessity of structural approaches that transform the conditions enabling harmful exposures rather than placing responsibility on individual behavior change among those with least power to alter their circumstances [9].

### Methodological Considerations and Evidence Quality

The evidence base exhibits notable heterogeneity in exposure assessment methodologies, ranging from crude fuel-type proxies to sophisticated personal monitoring, creating challenges for exposure-response synthesis and cross-study comparison [10]. Outcome ascertainment varies substantially, with diagnostic criteria for respiratory conditions developed primarily in high-income populations potentially lacking sensitivity for exposure profiles and disease presentations characteristic of biomass smoke exposure [11]. Inadequate control for co-exposures, including ambient air pollution, occupational exposures, and tobacco smoke, alongside limited longitudinal data, constrains causal inference despite biological plausibility [12]. These methodological limitations reflect broader measurement equity issues wherein research infrastructure concentrates in settings least affected by household air pollution, while populations bearing greatest burden remain underrepresented in evidence generation [13].

### Policy Implications and Health Equity

Addressing this preventable health burden requires gender-responsive policies recognizing cooking-related air pollution as a structural determinant of health inequity rather than an individual risk factor amenable to educational interventions alone [14]. Effective approaches must integrate clean energy access within broader development frameworks addressing poverty, gender inequality, and infrastructure deficits while ensuring women's meaningful participation in policy design and implementation [15].

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Indoor cooking smoke represents a substantial, preventable health burden affecting 2.4 billion people globally, with women disproportionately exposed through intersecting structural inequalities [1,2]. Evidence demonstrates significant respiratory, cardiovascular, and reproductive health impacts from household air pollution exposure [3,4]. Addressing this crisis requires coordinated action across multiple sectors. Policy interventions must prioritize scaling access to clean cooking solutions through gender-responsive implementation that recognizes women's decision-making autonomy [5]. Practice-based approaches must address structural barriers including fuel affordability, infrastructure access, and cultural acceptability [6]. Research priorities include developing equitable exposure assessment methodologies, conducting implementation science in real-world contexts, and evaluating interventions through gender-disaggregated analysis [7]. Meaningful progress demands integrated efforts spanning health, energy, gender equity, and sustainable development sectors [8].
