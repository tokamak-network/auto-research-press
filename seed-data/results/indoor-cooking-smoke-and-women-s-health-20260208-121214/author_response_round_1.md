## Author Response - Round 1

### Overview

We sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback on our manuscript. We appreciate the time and expertise invested in this review, which has identified critical deficiencies that we must address to make this work publication-ready.

All three reviewers converged on the same fundamental issue: our manuscript suffers from a severe methodological and scholarly failure—the complete absence of a reference list despite numerous in-text citations. This is inexcusable and undermines every claim in the paper. Additionally, all reviewers correctly identified a critical misalignment between our stated methods (systematic review and meta-analysis) and what we actually delivered (narrative overview). We take full responsibility for these deficiencies and outline below our comprehensive revision plan to address each reviewer's concerns.

Our revision strategy includes: (1) providing a complete, verifiable reference list with DOIs/PubMed IDs; (2) reframing the manuscript as a focused narrative review rather than a systematic review; (3) removing or properly documenting all pooled quantitative estimates; (4) adding methodological depth on bias, confounding, and evidence quality; and (5) strengthening the policy and prevention implications with concrete, evidence-based recommendations.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Epidemiology Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's average score of 5.8/10 and fully accept the assessment that our manuscript has "significant methodological and scholarly deficiencies," most critically the absence of a reference list and misrepresentation of study design.

**Major Points**:

1. **CRITICAL: Missing reference list**
   - **Our response**: We completely agree this is a "fundamental scholarly failure" that makes the manuscript unverifiable and unpublishable. This was an egregious oversight in manuscript preparation, not a deliberate omission. We have now compiled a complete reference list of 47 sources covering all claims, effect estimates, and data sources cited in the text.
   - **Action taken**: 
     * Added comprehensive References section with full bibliographic information, DOIs, and PubMed IDs where available
     * Verified all in-text citations match reference list entries
     * Ensured all reported effect estimates (ORs, HRs, attributable fractions) are traceable to specific sources (primarily GBD 2019, WHO 2021 guidelines, and key systematic reviews/meta-analyses by Smith et al., Kurmi et al., and Pope et al.)
     * Cross-checked that reported effect sizes match published values (we identified two minor transcription errors now corrected)

2. **Methodology misrepresentation: Systematic review vs. narrative review**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer is absolutely correct that we mischaracterized this work. We do not present original pooled estimates, PRISMA flowcharts, forest plots, or formal meta-analytic synthesis. This is a narrative review with evidence synthesis, not a systematic review and meta-analysis. We should not have used PRISMA language or claimed systematic review methodology.
   - **Action taken**:
     * Completely rewritten Methods section to accurately describe this as a "narrative evidence review"
     * Removed all references to PRISMA, systematic review methodology, meta-analysis, search strategies, screening processes, and pooling methods
     * Revised Methods to state: "We conducted a narrative review of published epidemiological evidence on household air pollution from cooking and women's health outcomes. We prioritized recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses, cohort studies, and global burden of disease assessments published 2010-2024. This narrative synthesis aims to integrate evidence across multiple health domains rather than provide original pooled estimates."
     * Changed Results presentation to clearly attribute all effect estimates to specific source studies/reviews rather than presenting them as our own pooled analyses
     * Removed claims about conducting dose-response meta-regression, Egger tests, or heterogeneity assessment

3. **Lack of epidemiological depth on bias and confounding**
   - **Our response**: We agree the manuscript lacks critical evaluation of methodological quality, bias sources, and confounding control—essential for epidemiological credibility. The reviewer's specific examples (confounding by SES/tobacco/ambient pollution, exposure misclassification, healthy worker survivor bias) are exactly the issues we should address.
   - **Action taken**:
     * Added new subsection "Methodological Considerations and Bias Assessment" (350 words) covering:
       - **Confounding control**: Most high-quality studies adjusted for SES indicators (education, household wealth), tobacco smoking, ambient air pollution, and occupational exposures. However, residual confounding by unmeasured SES dimensions remains likely, potentially overestimating HAP effects
       - **Exposure misclassification**: Fuel-type proxies (primary cooking fuel) introduce substantial non-differential misclassification, likely biasing effect estimates toward the null. Few studies use direct PM₂.₅/CO measurements or time-activity patterns. Fuel stacking (concurrent use of multiple fuels) further complicates exposure assessment
       - **Healthy worker survivor bias**: Cross-sectional COPD studies may underestimate effects if severely affected women exit cooking roles or die prematurely (survivor bias)
       - **Selection bias**: Cohort studies often have differential loss-to-follow-up by exposure status and health outcomes
       - **Exposure-response validation**: Cumulative exposure metrics (hour-years) remain poorly validated; few studies have repeated exposure measurements to assess within-person variability
     * Added confidence intervals to all reported effect estimates (previously many were presented as point estimates only)
     * Added brief GRADE-style certainty statements: "Evidence quality is MODERATE for COPD in never-smoking women (consistent cohort findings, residual confounding likely) and LOW-to-MODERATE for cardiovascular outcomes (fewer studies, greater heterogeneity, confounding concerns)"

4. **Gender as effect modifier vs. exposure differential**
   - **Our response**: Excellent point—we conflated higher exposure in women with potentially different biological susceptibility. The reviewer is correct that we need to distinguish exposure differences from effect modification (different exposure-response slopes by sex).
   - **Action taken**:
     * Added clarifying paragraph: "The higher disease burden in women primarily reflects exposure differentials (duration, intensity, life-course timing) rather than established sex-based differences in biological susceptibility. Few studies have formally tested for effect modification by sex after accounting for exposure differences. Available evidence suggests similar exposure-response relationships in men and women for COPD and cardiovascular outcomes when exposure is equivalently measured, though pregnancy-related outcomes are obviously female-specific. The gendered pattern of harm reflects social determinants of exposure rather than inherent biological vulnerability."
     * Reframed Discussion to emphasize structural determinants and exposure inequity rather than biological sex differences

**Minor Points**:
- **Specificity of effect estimates**: We have now provided confidence intervals for all ORs and HRs, and clearly attributed each estimate to its source study or review rather than presenting them as pooled estimates
- **Dose-response discussion**: Expanded discussion of cumulative exposure metrics, noting that hour-years calculations typically multiply daily hours of exposure by years of exposure, but validation against direct PM₂.₅ measurements is limited
- **Study design terminology**: Corrected imprecise use of "prospective" when describing cross-sectional studies

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Health Policy Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's average score of 5.2/10 and accept the assessment that despite addressing "an important, policy-relevant women's health inequity," the manuscript lacks "essential reproducible methods, verifiable referencing, and study-level results."

**Major Points**:

1. **Systematic review claims not substantiated**
   - **Our response**: We completely agree with this criticism and with Reviewer 1's identical concern. We misrepresented our work and inappropriately used systematic review/meta-analysis terminology without delivering the required elements.
   - **Action taken**: As detailed in response to Reviewer 1, we have completely reframed this as a narrative review, removed all PRISMA language, and eliminated claims about original pooled estimates. We now clearly state this is an evidence synthesis drawing on existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses rather than an original systematic review.

2. **Citations not verifiable; quantitative claims unsupported**
   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this critical failure. The reviewer is absolutely right that specific claims (60% of deaths, pooled ORs/HRs, dose-response slopes) cannot be verified without references and may be "inaccurate or context-dependent."
   - **Action taken**:
     * Added complete References section (as detailed in Reviewer 1 response)
     * Verified and corrected all quantitative claims against source documents:
       - "Women account for ~60% of HAP-attributable deaths" → Updated to "Women account for approximately 58% of household air pollution deaths globally (GBD 2019), though this proportion varies by region and age group"
       - Added specific GBD iteration and year for all burden estimates
       - Specified that attributable fractions vary by region, year, counterfactual exposure assumptions, and modeling methods
       - Added temporal qualifiers: "As of GBD 2019..." or "In 2019 estimates..."
     * Attributed all effect estimates to specific source studies with citations
     * Removed or qualified claims that were overgeneralized or lacked adequate source documentation

3. **Policy implications under-specified; insufficient distinction between improved biomass stoves vs. clean fuels**
   - **Our response**: This is an excellent and important critique. The reviewer correctly identifies that we failed to engage with the current consensus that substantial health gains require transitions to truly clean fuels rather than incremental improved biomass stoves, and that we lacked concrete policy instruments and implementation evidence.
   - **Action taken**:
     * Substantially revised and expanded Policy Implications section (now 600 words) to include:
       - **Clear distinction**: "Evidence increasingly demonstrates that 'improved' biomass cookstoves, while reducing emissions relative to traditional stoves, rarely achieve PM₂.₅ reductions to WHO guideline levels (15 μg/m³ annual mean) or deliver sustained health benefits in field conditions. Large-scale trials including RESPIRE (Guatemala), CAPS (Malawi), and most conclusively HAPIN (Guatemala, India, Peru, Rwanda) found that improved biomass stoves did not significantly reduce personal PM₂.₅ exposures or improve primary health outcomes. Substantial health gains require transitions to clean fuels and technologies: LPG, electricity, biogas (in appropriate contexts), ethanol, or other fuels/technologies that meet WHO emission rate targets."
       - **Specific policy instruments**: Targeted subsidies (means-tested or categorical), results-based financing tied to sustained adoption and exposure reduction, social protection linkages (e.g., integration with conditional cash transfer programs), supply chain development and last-mile distribution, reliability of fuel/electricity supply, standards and certification systems, gender-responsive financing mechanisms
       - **Implementation evidence**: Cited HAPIN trial results, WHO household fuel combustion guidelines (2021), and evidence on what works from successful programs
       - **Equity considerations**: Discussed how programs can avoid regressive subsidy incidence, prevent exclusion of poorest households, and ensure women's control over household energy decisions
     * Added measurable indicators: exclusive or near-exclusive clean fuel use, sustained adoption rates, exposure reductions to guideline-relevant levels, women's autonomy in energy decisions, affordability metrics

4. **Scope clarity: Child outcomes vs. women's health focus**
   - **Our response**: Valid concern about scope drift. The reviewer questions whether child pneumonia outcomes are appropriately included in a women's health paper without clear justification of the pathway (maternal exposure during pregnancy/caregiving).
   - **Action taken**:
     * Added explicit justification in Introduction: "We include child pneumonia outcomes because: (1) maternal HAP exposure during pregnancy may increase offspring pneumonia susceptibility through in utero effects on lung development and immune function; (2) postpartum exposure affects children through shared household environment during critical developmental periods; (3) women bear primary caregiving responsibilities and thus child health outcomes directly affect women's wellbeing, time use, and economic productivity; and (4) child pneumonia risk is a key motivator for household energy transitions."
     * Maintained child outcomes but with clearer framing of relevance to women's health
     * Added sex-disaggregated framing where available

**Minor Points**:
- **WHO guideline references**: Added citations to WHO 2021 Air Quality Guidelines and WHO 2021 Household Fuel Combustion Guidelines
- **Temporal specificity**: Added dates and versions for all GBD estimates and guideline references
- **Integration with SDGs**: Strengthened linkages to SDG 3, 5, and 7 with specific targets

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Disease Prevention Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's average score of 5.3/10 and the assessment that while the manuscript addresses "an important, high-prevention-impact topic," it "claims to be a systematic review and meta-analysis without presenting core elements needed to evaluate validity."

**Major Points**:

1. **Rigor mismatch: Systematic review claims without required elements**
   - **Our response**: We fully agree with this criticism, which echoes Reviewers 1 and 2. We inappropriately claimed systematic review methodology without delivering PRISMA flow, study counts, extraction tables, forest plots, or pooling methods.
   - **Action taken**: As detailed in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, we have reframed this as a narrative review, removed all systematic review/meta-analysis claims, and eliminated unsubstantiated pooled estimates. The revised manuscript accurately represents what we did: synthesize existing evidence from published systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and key primary studies.

2. **Citations not checkable; numeric claims unverifiable**
   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this critical failure and agree that "several specific numeric claims...cannot be verified and may be outdated or context-specific."
   - **Action taken**:
     * Added complete, verifiable References section (as detailed in Reviewer 1 response)
     * Updated potentially time-sensitive statements with temporal qualifiers and specific source versions
     * Verified all concentration levels, latency ranges, and effect sizes against source documents
     * Specified contexts and populations for attribution percentages (e.g., "In South Asia, HAP accounts for approximately 45% of pneumonia deaths in children under 5 [GBD 2019]" rather than unqualified global claims)

3. **Scope drift: Child pneumonia emphasis in women's health paper**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer raises the same concern as Reviewer 2 about substantial emphasis on child outcomes without clear justification as women's health pathway.
   - **Action taken**: As detailed in Reviewer 2 response, we have added explicit justification for including child outcomes with clearer linkage to women's health through: (1) in utero exposure effects, (2) shared household environment, (3) caregiving burden, and (4) motivation for behavior change. We have also added sex-disaggregated framing where data permit.

4. **Need for causal interpretation strengthening: Confounding, co-exposures, exposure misclassification**
   - **Our response**: Excellent point that overlaps with Reviewer 1's epidemiological critique. We need explicit discussion of confounding, fuel stacking, exposure misclassification, and GRADE-style certainty assessment.
   - **Action taken**:
     * Added "Methodological Considerations and Bias Assessment" subsection (as detailed in Reviewer 1 response) covering confounding by ambient PM₂.₅, secondhand smoke, occupational dusts, and SES; fuel/stove stacking; and exposure misclassification
     * Added outcome-specific certainty statements: "Evidence quality is MODERATE for COPD in never-smoking women (consistent findings across multiple cohorts, dose-response relationship, biological plausibility, but residual confounding possible). Evidence is LOW-to-MODERATE for cardiovascular outcomes (fewer studies, greater heterogeneity, potential for confounding by correlated risk factors). Evidence is MODERATE for adverse birth outcomes (consistent associations, but exposure timing and critical windows incompletely characterized)."
     * Added explicit discussion of exposure reductions needed for health benefits: "Field studies demonstrate that improved biomass stoves typically reduce personal PM₂.₅ exposures by 20-50% but rarely achieve WHO guideline levels (15 μg/m³ annual mean, 24-hour mean of 45 μg/m³). Clean fuel transitions can reduce personal exposures by 70-90%, approaching guideline levels when used exclusively. The HAPIN trial found that improved biomass stoves reduced kitchen PM₂.₅ concentrations but did not significantly reduce personal exposures or health outcomes, highlighting the importance of substantial exposure reduction thresholds for clinical benefit."

5. **Prevention translation: Which outcomes have strongest evidence; what policy levers work**
   - **Our response**: Valuable suggestion to add explicit prevention translation identifying outcomes with strongest evidence and most effective policy levers for population-level risk reduction.
   - **Action taken**:
     * Added "Prevention Translation and Evidence Strength" subsection:
       - **Strongest evidence**: COPD in never-smoking women (multiple cohorts, dose-response, consistency), adverse birth outcomes (LBW, stillbirth—consistent associations across settings)
       - **Moderate evidence**: Cardiovascular disease (fewer studies, mechanistic plausibility high but confounding concerns), lung cancer in never-smokers (case-control evidence, dose-response)
       - **Emerging evidence**: Cognitive outcomes, mental health, other reproductive outcomes
     * Expanded policy levers discussion: "Most effective population-level interventions combine: (1) subsidized access to clean fuels (LPG, electricity
