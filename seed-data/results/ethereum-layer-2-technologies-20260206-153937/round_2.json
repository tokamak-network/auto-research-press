The treatment of consensus-related challenges is superficial given the claimed scope.",

        "Section 7 on sequencer architecture is incomplete (appears truncated) and lacks critical analysis of proposed decentralization mechanisms such as shared sequencer networks (Espresso, Astria), leader rotation protocols, and their Byzantine fault tolerance properties",
        "No substantive treatment of bridge security models, withdrawal delay mechanisms, or cross-layer communication protocols despite these being fundamental to L2 security - the manuscript mentions 7-day withdrawal periods but doesn't analyze the security assumptions or attack vectors",
        "Liveness guarantees are inadequately addressed - the manuscript mentions forced inclusion mechanisms but doesn't formally characterize liveness properties under various adversarial conditions (sequencer censorship, L1 congestion, DA layer failures)"

      "suggestions": [
        "Complete Section 7 with rigorous analysis of decentralized sequencer proposals, including consensus mechanisms (e.g., HotStuff variants for shared sequencers), MEV-aware ordering protocols (threshold encryption, commit-reveal), and formal liveness bounds under partial synchrony assumptions",
        "Add a dedicated section on bridge security covering canonical bridges vs. third-party bridges, the trust assumptions of different withdrawal mechanisms (optimistic vs. validity-proof based), and analysis of historical bridge exploits with lessons for L2 design",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competence in cryptographic proof systems but falls short in its treatment of consensus and coordination challenges that are equally critical to L2 security. The sequencer section's truncation is particularly problematic as this represents one of the most active research areas in L2 design. The manuscript should address: (1) How do proposed shared sequencer networks like Espresso achieve consensus? What are their BFT thresholds and finality guarantees? (2) What happens during sequencer failover - is there a leader election protocol, and what are the safety/liveness tradeoffs? (3) How do forced inclusion mechanisms interact with L1 congestion - if Ethereum blocks are full, what are the worst-case inclusion delays? The bridge security omission is significant given that bridge exploits have resulted in billions of dollars in losses. The manuscript should analyze the security model of canonical rollup bridges (which inherit rollup security) versus external bridges (which introduce additional trust assumptions). The 7-day withdrawal delay for optimistic rollups deserves deeper analysis: Why 7 days specifically? What's the relationship between dispute window length, L1 finality, and security? How do fast withdrawal services (liquidity providers) change the trust model? Finally, the MEV discussion would benefit from more rigorous treatment of ordering fairness definitions (e.g., receive-order fairness, block-order fairness) and the impossibility results that constrain what sequencers can achieve. The claim that fair ordering requires 'sequencer honesty' understates the complexity - even honest sequencers face fundamental limitations in defining and achieving fairness in asynchronous networks.",

        "Fee market dynamics are inadequately analyzed - no discussion of L2 fee mechanisms (EIP-1559 variants, priority fees), congestion pricing, or empirical fee volatility compared to L1. The claim of '80-90% cost reduction' post-Dencun lacks rigorous economic analysis of how blob pricing affects L2 fee structures",

        "Add a dedicated section on L2 fee market mechanisms comparing Arbitrum's ArbOS fee model, Optimism's Ecotone pricing, and zkSync's fee structure. Include empirical analysis of fee volatility, user cost distribution, and sequencer revenue decomposition",

        "Expand the prover economics section with mechanism design analysis: optimal auction formats for prover selection, incentive compatibility of proposed prover markets, and capital efficiency comparisons between centralized proving and decentralized prover networks"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain economics and mechanism design perspective, this manuscript exhibits significant gaps that undermine its claim to be a 'comprehensive analysis.' The treatment of fee markets is particularly weak - while the report mentions cost reductions, it fails to analyze the underlying fee mechanisms. For instance, how do L2s handle congestion? What are the welfare implications of centralized sequencer pricing power? The 7-day dispute window is presented as a security parameter, but there's no analysis of the economic trade-offs: longer windows increase capital lockup costs for users (affecting withdrawal liquidity and DeFi composability), while shorter windows reduce security margins. The opportunity cost calculation ($960 on a $1M bond) is simplistic and ignores risk-adjusted returns, collateral rehypothecation possibilities, and the option value of capital. The MEV analysis, while including useful estimates, doesn't engage with the fundamental mechanism design question: how should MEV be allocated in a welfare-maximizing way? The comparison table of mitigation approaches lacks analysis of their incentive compatibility. For economic security, the report should model the 'cost of corruption' - what would it cost to bribe/compromise the sequencer, DAC members, or prover network? How does this scale with TVL? The absence of any discussion of L2 token economics (ARB, OP) and their role in incentive alignment is a notable omission given their importance in governance and potential future sequencer decentralization. Finally, the capital efficiency of different L2 architectures deserves rigorous treatment: ZK rollups require expensive proving infrastructure while optimistic rollups lock user capital during dispute windows - these represent different points on the capital efficiency frontier that should be formally characterized.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a ZK cryptography perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the landscape but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive technical analysis. The proof system comparison table is useful but oversimplifies critical nuances. For instance, stating PLONK+KZG verification is ~300K gas obscures significant variation based on the number of public inputs, custom gates, and lookup arguments used. The Groth16 proof size of '~128 bytes' should specify this is for BN254 (actually 192 bytes for 2 G1 + 1 G2 elements) and differs for other curves.\n\nThe treatment of trusted setup requirements deserves more nuance. While correctly noting that PLONK uses a universal setup, the manuscript should clarify that the setup size must exceed the maximum circuit size, and that zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM required substantial ceremonies (the Hermez ceremony had 176 participants, not 100,000+ as implied). The security degradation under setup compromise also warrants discussion - for KZG, a compromised setup enables forging proofs, completely breaking soundness.\n\nThe recursive proof composition section is the weakest from a technical standpoint. Nova's folding scheme is mentioned but not explained - the key insight that folding avoids the full cost of recursive verification by accumulating instances is missed. The manuscript should discuss why Halo2's approach using IPA enables recursion without trusted setup, and how this differs from the cycle-of-curves approach used in systems like Mina. The '2-3x overhead per recursion level' for STARKs needs citation and context - this varies significantly based on the hash function and field size.\n\nThe prover economics section correctly identifies the centralization concern but lacks quantitative depth. What is the actual cost breakdown between MSM operations, FFTs, and hash computations? How do GPU-optimized provers (like those using CUDA for MSM) compare to CPU implementations? The claim that STARK proving is 'more parallelizable' than SNARK proving needs qualification - both involve parallelizable components (MSMs, FFTs) and the practical difference depends heavily on implementation.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from discussing recent developments in proof aggregation beyond simple recursion: Nebra's approach to universal proof aggregation, the use of lookup arguments for efficient verification circuit construction, and the emerging work on client-side proving for privacy applications. These developments are reshaping the practical landscape of ZK rollups and deserve attention in a comprehensive 2025 analysis.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a technically competent survey of Ethereum Layer 2 scaling technologies, with particular strength in its treatment of zero-knowledge proof systems, rollup architectures, and fraud proof mechanisms. All three reviewers acknowledge the solid foundational coverage, clear writing, and accurate technical descriptions of core concepts including zkEVM classification, polynomial commitment schemes, and data availability sampling. The manuscript demonstrates genuine expertise in cryptographic aspects of L2 systems.\n\nHowever, the reviewers converge on several significant gaps that prevent acceptance in the current form. First, the distributed systems analysis is incomplete\u2014Section 7 appears truncated, and critical topics including sequencer decentralization mechanisms, bridge security models, and formal liveness guarantees are either missing or superficially treated. Second, the economic analysis lacks rigor: fee market dynamics, security budget modeling, and prover market mechanism design are mentioned but not substantively analyzed. Third, even in the stronger cryptographic sections, reviewers note missing formal security definitions, incomplete recursive proof composition coverage, and insufficient prover complexity benchmarks. The average score of 6.7 with consistent 5-6 ratings on novelty and rigor across all reviewers indicates that while the foundation is sound, substantial work is needed to meet the standards of a comprehensive technical report.",

    "recommendation": "The manuscript has a solid technical foundation but requires substantial expansion to fulfill its stated scope as a comprehensive technical report. Authors should prioritize: (1) completing the truncated Section 7 with full sequencer decentralization and bridge security analysis, (2) adding a dedicated economics section with formal mechanism analysis, and (3) strengthening the cryptographic sections with formal definitions and concrete benchmarks. Given that this is Round 2 of 3, authors have one remaining revision cycle to address these issues. The core technical content is accurate and well-written\u2014the primary task is depth expansion rather than fundamental restructuring. I recommend the authors allocate approximately equal effort to the distributed systems gaps (sequencer/bridge/liveness) and the economic analysis gaps, as both are critical for a complete treatment of L2 technologies.",
