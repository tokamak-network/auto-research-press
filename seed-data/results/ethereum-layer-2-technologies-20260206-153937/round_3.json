        "Complete the truncated sections and add dedicated coverage of bridge security models including canonical bridges, third-party bridges, their respective trust assumptions, and historical exploit analysis (Ronin, Wormhole, Nomad)",

        "Add rigorous treatment of cross-layer communication including message passing protocols, finality considerations for L2\u2192L1 messages, and the security implications of different confirmation depths"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems and consensus perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the core technical mechanisms but falls short on several critical aspects within my review scope. The sequencer discussion is particularly underdeveloped\u2014while the document correctly identifies centralization as the current state, it provides no analysis of the consensus challenges in decentralized sequencer designs. For instance, what are the latency-throughput tradeoffs of BFT-based sequencer consensus versus single-leader designs? How do shared sequencer networks handle cross-rollup atomicity, and what are the MEV implications of sequencer ordering across multiple rollups? The 'based rollup' concept where L1 proposers sequence L2 transactions deserves mention given its implications for MEV redistribution and censorship resistance.\n\nThe data availability section covers EIP-4844 and DAS adequately but neglects the emerging ecosystem of modular DA layers. Celestia's Tendermint-based consensus with data availability sampling, EigenDA's restaking-based security model, and their respective trust assumptions versus native Ethereum DA represent important architectural choices that rollup developers must evaluate. The DAC threshold assumptions mentioned (5-of-9) need more rigorous treatment\u2014what happens during committee member unavailability? How are committee members selected and rotated?\n\nThe forced inclusion analysis is good but should address the interaction between forced inclusion and sequencer MEV more formally. A sequencer seeing a forced transaction in the delayed inbox can front-run it in the current batch, extracting value before the forced inclusion deadline. This creates a censorship-extraction equivalence that undermines the censorship resistance guarantees.\n\nThe 7-day dispute window justification is honest about the lack of rigorous optimization, but this is actually a significant open research question. Recent work on optimistic protocols suggests that adaptive dispute windows based on stake-weighted attestations could reduce withdrawal delays while maintaining security\u2014this deserves mention.\n\nFinally, the complete absence of bridge security analysis is a critical gap. Cross-layer communication is fundamental to L2 utility, and the security models differ dramatically between canonical rollup bridges (which inherit rollup security) and third-party bridges (which introduce additional trust assumptions). The withdrawal delay mechanism, escape hatch designs, and upgrade key security are essential topics that must be addressed for this to be a comprehensive analysis.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Fee market dynamics across L2s are essentially absent - no analysis of EIP-4844 blob fee markets, L2 fee mechanisms (Arbitrum's ArbGas, Optimism's fee scalar), or how L2 fees respond to L1 congestion",
        "Sequencer economics and MEV extraction are mentioned only tangentially - no quantitative analysis of sequencer revenue streams, MEV opportunities, or the economic implications of centralized sequencing",
        "Economic security analysis lacks formal attack cost modeling - no calculation of minimum attack costs, capital requirements for various attack vectors, or comparison of economic security budgets across rollup types"
      ],

        "Add a dedicated section on L2 fee market mechanisms comparing Arbitrum's two-dimensional fee model (L2 execution + L1 data) with Optimism's approach, including empirical fee data and elasticity analysis",
        "Develop a formal economic security framework quantifying attack costs for different threat models: sequencer misbehavior, prover collusion, data withholding attacks, and bridge exploits with specific capital requirement calculations",
        "Include analysis of sequencer revenue and MEV dynamics - estimate sequencer profits from ordering, compare with L1 MEV extraction, and evaluate proposed solutions like encrypted mempools, MEV-Share, and Flashbots Protect integration on L2s"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a mechanism design perspective, this manuscript has significant gaps that undermine its claim to be a 'comprehensive analysis.' The most glaring omission is the complete absence of fee market analysis. Post-EIP-4844, the blob fee market operates as a separate EIP-1559-style mechanism with its own base fee dynamics, yet this is not discussed. Similarly, L2-specific fee mechanisms differ substantially: Arbitrum uses a sophisticated two-dimensional pricing model separating L2 computation from L1 data costs, while Optimism employs a simpler fee scalar approach. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for evaluating L2 economics.\n\nThe sequencer incentive analysis is particularly weak. The manuscript acknowledges centralized sequencing but fails to analyze the economic implications. Sequencers currently capture significant value through transaction ordering - estimates suggest $50-100M annually across major L2s - yet this is not quantified. The manuscript mentions MEV in passing but doesn't analyze how L2 MEV differs from L1 (shorter block times, centralized ordering, cross-domain MEV opportunities). Proposed decentralized sequencer designs (shared sequencing, based rollups, leader rotation) have profound economic implications that deserve rigorous treatment.\n\nThe economic security analysis, while touching on bond sizing and challenge incentives, lacks the formal rigor expected. A proper analysis would include: (1) minimum viable attack cost calculations for each rollup type, (2) comparison of economic security budgets (e.g., Arbitrum's sequencer bond vs. zkSync's prover stake vs. Ethereum's validator stake), (3) analysis of how security scales with TVL and whether current parameters are appropriately calibrated. The manuscript mentions a $1M bond for Arbitrum but doesn't analyze whether this is economically sufficient given current TVL of $15B - the ratio suggests potential undercollateralization.\n\nThe prover economics section is a positive addition but remains incomplete. It should include analysis of the prover fee market design, how proving rights are allocated, and the equilibrium dynamics of prover competition. The cartel risk discussion is qualitative; a quantitative analysis of concentration thresholds and their economic implications would strengthen this section.\n\nFinally, the capital efficiency comparison between optimistic and ZK rollups deserves more attention. The 7-day withdrawal delay represents significant capital lockup costs that affect user behavior and liquidity provision. Fast withdrawal services (bridges, liquidity providers) have emerged to address this, creating their own economic dynamics that should be analyzed.",

        "Include formal analysis of soundness amplification/degradation under composition - specifically, how the ~2^(-75) soundness error in individual proofs compounds across recursive layers and what this implies for system-wide security parameters"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a ZK cryptography perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the field but falls short of the depth expected for a comprehensive technical analysis. The proof system comparison table is useful but oversimplified - Groth16 verification is listed as ~200K gas, but this varies significantly with the number of public inputs (each additional public input adds ~6K gas for the scalar multiplication). Similarly, the PLONK+KZG verification cost depends heavily on the number of custom gates and lookup arguments used.\n\nThe treatment of polynomial commitment schemes is adequate but misses important nuances. For KZG, the manuscript correctly identifies the trusted setup requirement but doesn't discuss the degree bound implications - the SRS size must exceed the maximum polynomial degree, which for zkSync Era's circuits means ceremonies producing millions of powers of tau. The security reduction from q-SDH to knowledge soundness deserves more attention, particularly the concrete security loss in the AGM.\n\nThe recursive proof composition section is one of the stronger parts, but the Nova/Sangria discussion could be expanded. The claim of '~10,000 constraints per folding step' for Nova is approximately correct for the basic scheme but doesn't account for the final decider proof, which still requires a full SNARK. The manuscript should clarify that Nova provides IVC efficiency but the final verification still incurs substantial cost.\n\nFor STARKs, the FRI protocol description is superficial. The security of FRI depends critically on the number of queries, the blowup factor, and the grinding parameter - none of which are discussed. The claim of 'post-quantum security' is correct but should note that this assumes the hash function (typically Poseidon or Rescue for algebraic efficiency) remains secure against quantum attacks, which is believed but not proven.\n\nThe prover benchmark table is valuable but should include standard deviation or ranges, as proving times vary dramatically with transaction composition. A batch of simple transfers proves much faster than a batch containing complex DeFi interactions. Additionally, the manuscript should discuss prover parallelization strategies - both intra-proof parallelism (parallel MSM, parallel FFT) and inter-proof parallelism (proving multiple batches simultaneously).\n\nFinally, the zkEVM type classification is well-presented, but the constraint count estimates need citations or methodology explanation. The claim that Type-1 requires '>100 million constraints per block' appears to be an estimate rather than a measured value, and the basis for this estimate should be clarified.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a technically competent overview of Ethereum L2 technologies, with reviewers consistently praising its treatment of ZK proof systems, fraud proof game theory, and security assumption analysis. The coverage of arithmetization schemes, polynomial commitment schemes, and prover economics demonstrates genuine technical depth that distinguishes it from typical survey papers. All three reviewers noted the clarity of exposition and the practical value of concrete parameters (bond requirements, forced inclusion timings, cost decompositions).\n\nHowever, the manuscript suffers from a critical structural flaw: it is truncated mid-sentence in Section 5.2, leaving substantial promised content undelivered. This is not a minor presentation issue\u2014it means bridge security models, withdrawal mechanisms, and several major ZK rollup implementations (Polygon zkEVM, Scroll) are entirely missing. Beyond the truncation, reviewers identified substantive gaps in economic analysis (fee markets, sequencer MEV dynamics, formal attack cost modeling) and technical depth (proof aggregation techniques, soundness composition under recursion, data availability layer analysis). These omissions prevent the manuscript from achieving the comprehensive coverage its scope implies.\n\nWhile the existing content is of reasonable quality (average score 6.9), the combination of incomplete sections and missing analytical frameworks represents too significant a gap for minor revision. The authors have demonstrated capability in the completed portions, suggesting these issues are addressable with focused effort rather than fundamental reconceptualization.",
