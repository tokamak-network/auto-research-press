The claim that SNARKs produce '200-300 byte' proofs is imprecise\u2014Groth16 proofs are ~128 bytes (2 G1 + 1 G2 elements), while PLONK proofs are typically 400-800 bytes depending on the polynomial commitment scheme. The verification cost comparison is similarly incomplete: Groth16 verification requires a single pairing check (~200k gas), while PLONK verification involves multiple scalar multiplications and polynomial evaluations with different gas profiles. The manuscript states zkSync Era uses 'SNARKs' without specifying it employs PLONK with KZG commitments, which has fundamentally different properties than Groth16. Similarly, Polygon zkEVM uses a custom SNARK construction that deserves detailed analysis. The discussion of trusted setup is oversimplified\u2014modern universal SNARKs (PLONK, Marlin) require only a one-time universal setup rather than per-circuit ceremonies, which is a crucial distinction. The treatment of proof aggregation is particularly weak: there's no discussion of how recursive composition works (verifying a proof within a proof), the overhead of recursion-friendly hash functions, or the distinction between proof aggregation (combining multiple proofs into one) and proof recursion (proving verification of previous proofs). For a comprehensive analysis, the manuscript should address: (1) the specific arithmetization schemes (R1CS, PLONKish, AIR) and their implications for circuit design; (2) the concrete verification costs on Ethereum for each proof system; (3) the prover hardware requirements and decentralization implications; and (4) the security assumptions beyond 'discrete logarithm'\u2014specifically, the knowledge-of-exponent assumption for Groth16 and the algebraic group model for PLONK.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain economics and mechanism design perspective, this manuscript represents a missed opportunity. The technical architecture sections are competent but the economic analysis\u2014which should be central to understanding L2 sustainability and security\u2014is treated as an afterthought. The fee structure discussion in Section 7.1 merely lists cost components without analyzing how fees are determined, how they respond to demand fluctuations, or how different L2s have implemented (or failed to implement) efficient pricing mechanisms. There is no discussion of whether current L2 fee markets achieve allocative efficiency or how they compare to Ethereum's EIP-1559 mechanism.\n\nThe sequencer economics discussion is particularly weak given its importance. Centralized sequencers represent a fundamental departure from blockchain's trust-minimization goals, yet the manuscript offers no analysis of the economic incentives that might lead to sequencer misbehavior, the costs of such misbehavior to users, or the mechanism design challenges in transitioning to decentralized sequencing. The brief mention of 'shared sequencer networks' ignores critical questions: How are sequencer rewards distributed? What prevents collusion? How do different sequencer selection mechanisms affect censorship resistance and MEV extraction?\n\nThe security economics section is essentially absent. For optimistic rollups, there is no analysis of the economic security provided by fraud proofs: What is the minimum bond size needed to ensure honest verification? How does the 7-day challenge period affect capital efficiency? What are the game-theoretic equilibria in the fraud proof game? For ZK rollups, there is no discussion of prover economics: How are provers compensated? What prevents prover centralization? How do proof generation costs affect the minimum viable batch size and thus user experience?\n\nThe revenue figures in Table 7.2 are presented without context or analysis. What are the cost structures underlying these revenues? Are these protocols economically sustainable without token subsidies? How do sequencer margins compare across protocols and what explains the variation? The manuscript should model the long-term economic sustainability of different L2 business models, particularly as competition intensifies and data availability costs decline with full danksharding.\n\nFinally, the token economics discussion is superficial. The statement that ARB has 'no direct fee capture mechanism' deserves deeper analysis\u2014what are the implications for token value accrual and governance incentive alignment? How does Optimism's retroactive public goods funding mechanism actually work economically, and what evidence exists for its effectiveness? These are fundamental questions for understanding L2 ecosystem evolution that the manuscript leaves unaddressed.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems and consensus perspective, this manuscript misses several critical technical dimensions. The sequencer discussion acknowledges centralization risks but fails to analyze the actual consensus mechanisms proposed for decentralization\u2014Espresso's HotShot BFT variant, Astria's CometBFT-based approach, and based rollup proposer selection all have distinct liveness and safety properties that deserve formal comparison. The claim that 'users can typically force inclusion through L1 mechanisms after delay periods' glosses over the substantial complexity here: forced inclusion requires users to pay L1 gas costs, may have censorship-resistance delays of 12-24 hours on some rollups, and creates MEV opportunities during the delay window. The paper should quantify these parameters across protocols.\n\nThe data availability treatment is particularly concerning given its centrality to rollup security. The manuscript correctly distinguishes rollups from validiums but doesn't analyze the cryptographic and game-theoretic foundations of data availability sampling, which is essential for understanding full danksharding's security model. The 2D Reed-Solomon encoding, the sampling requirements for probabilistic guarantees, and the relationship between blob count and reconstruction probability are all absent. Similarly, the emerging ecosystem of modular DA layers (Celestia, EigenDA, Avail) receives no technical analysis despite their growing adoption.\n\nBridge security analysis should go beyond listing incidents to provide a formal threat model. The 7-day withdrawal delay in optimistic rollups is presented as a simple parameter, but its game-theoretic justification\u2014ensuring sufficient time for fraud proof submission under network delays and censorship attacks\u2014deserves rigorous treatment. The paper should analyze the capital efficiency implications: $45B TVL with 7-day delays implies substantial opportunity costs that fast bridges address through liquidity provision, introducing their own trust assumptions around LP collateralization and oracle reliability.\n\nThe comparative tables are useful but lack the metrics most relevant to distributed systems analysis: time-to-finality under various adversarial assumptions, censorship resistance quantification, and formal security parameter comparisons. The TVL and TPS figures, while informative for market context, don't constitute rigorous technical evaluation.",

All reviewers praised the taxonomic structure distinguishing optimistic rollups, ZK rollups, validiums, and state channels, as well as the comprehensive coverage of major implementations. However, the manuscript reads more as an industry overview than a research paper.\n\nThe weaknesses identified are substantial and span all three critical dimensions of L2 analysis. Reviewer 1 highlights the superficial treatment of zero-knowledge cryptography\u2014missing proof system internals (Groth16 vs PLONK vs FRI), prover efficiency metrics, and recursive proof composition techniques. Reviewer 2 identifies severe underdevelopment of economic analysis, including absent formal modeling of fee markets, inadequate MEV treatment, and no economic security analysis. Reviewer 3 notes critical gaps in distributed systems concerns: sequencer design lacks formal MEV analysis, data availability omits erasure coding and DAS parameters, and bridge security lacks formal security models. The novelty scores (all 4/10) indicate the work does not advance the field beyond existing knowledge.\n\nDespite these significant shortcomings, the foundation is sound.

The sequencer section's truncation is particularly problematic as this represents one of the most active research areas in L2 design. The manuscript should address: (1) How do proposed shared sequencer networks like Espresso achieve consensus? What are their BFT thresholds and finality guarantees? (2) What happens during sequencer failover - is there a leader election protocol, and what are the safety/liveness tradeoffs? (3) How do forced inclusion mechanisms interact with L1 congestion - if Ethereum blocks are full, what are the worst-case inclusion delays? The bridge security omission is significant given that bridge exploits have resulted in billions of dollars in losses. The manuscript should analyze the security model of canonical rollup bridges (which inherit rollup security) versus external bridges (which introduce additional trust assumptions). The 7-day withdrawal delay for optimistic rollups deserves deeper analysis: Why 7 days specifically? What's the relationship between dispute window length, L1 finality, and security? How do fast withdrawal services (liquidity providers) change the trust model? Finally, the MEV discussion would benefit from more rigorous treatment of ordering fairness definitions (e.g., receive-order fairness, block-order fairness) and the impossibility results that constrain what sequencers can achieve. The claim that fair ordering requires 'sequencer honesty' understates the complexity - even honest sequencers face fundamental limitations in defining and achieving fairness in asynchronous networks.",

The treatment of fee markets is particularly weak - while the report mentions cost reductions, it fails to analyze the underlying fee mechanisms. For instance, how do L2s handle congestion? What are the welfare implications of centralized sequencer pricing power? The 7-day dispute window is presented as a security parameter, but there's no analysis of the economic trade-offs: longer windows increase capital lockup costs for users (affecting withdrawal liquidity and DeFi composability), while shorter windows reduce security margins. The opportunity cost calculation ($960 on a $1M bond) is simplistic and ignores risk-adjusted returns, collateral rehypothecation possibilities, and the option value of capital. The MEV analysis, while including useful estimates, doesn't engage with the fundamental mechanism design question: how should MEV be allocated in a welfare-maximizing way? The comparison table of mitigation approaches lacks analysis of their incentive compatibility. For economic security, the report should model the 'cost of corruption' - what would it cost to bribe/compromise the sequencer, DAC members, or prover network? How does this scale with TVL? The absence of any discussion of L2 token economics (ARB, OP) and their role in incentive alignment is a notable omission given their importance in governance and potential future sequencer decentralization. Finally, the capital efficiency of different L2 architectures deserves rigorous treatment: ZK rollups require expensive proving infrastructure while optimistic rollups lock user capital during dispute windows - these represent different points on the capital efficiency frontier that should be formally characterized.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a ZK cryptography perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the landscape but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive technical analysis. The proof system comparison table is useful but oversimplifies critical nuances. For instance, stating PLONK+KZG verification is ~300K gas obscures significant variation based on the number of public inputs, custom gates, and lookup arguments used. The Groth16 proof size of '~128 bytes' should specify this is for BN254 (actually 192 bytes for 2 G1 + 1 G2 elements) and differs for other curves.\n\nThe treatment of trusted setup requirements deserves more nuance. While correctly noting that PLONK uses a universal setup, the manuscript should clarify that the setup size must exceed the maximum circuit size, and that zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM required substantial ceremonies (the Hermez ceremony had 176 participants, not 100,000+ as implied). The security degradation under setup compromise also warrants discussion - for KZG, a compromised setup enables forging proofs, completely breaking soundness.\n\nThe recursive proof composition section is the weakest from a technical standpoint. Nova's folding scheme is mentioned but not explained - the key insight that folding avoids the full cost of recursive verification by accumulating instances is missed. The manuscript should discuss why Halo2's approach using IPA enables recursion without trusted setup, and how this differs from the cycle-of-curves approach used in systems like Mina. The '2-3x overhead per recursion level' for STARKs needs citation and context - this varies significantly based on the hash function and field size.\n\nThe prover economics section correctly identifies the centralization concern but lacks quantitative depth. What is the actual cost breakdown between MSM operations, FFTs, and hash computations? How do GPU-optimized provers (like those using CUDA for MSM) compare to CPU implementations? The claim that STARK proving is 'more parallelizable' than SNARK proving needs qualification - both involve parallelizable components (MSMs, FFTs) and the practical difference depends heavily on implementation.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from discussing recent developments in proof aggregation beyond simple recursion: Nebra's approach to universal proof aggregation, the use of lookup arguments for efficient verification circuit construction, and the emerging work on client-side proving for privacy applications. These developments are reshaping the practical landscape of ZK rollups and deserve attention in a comprehensive 2025 analysis.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems and consensus perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the core technical mechanisms but falls short on several critical aspects within my review scope. The sequencer discussion is particularly underdeveloped\u2014while the document correctly identifies centralization as the current state, it provides no analysis of the consensus challenges in decentralized sequencer designs. For instance, what are the latency-throughput tradeoffs of BFT-based sequencer consensus versus single-leader designs? How do shared sequencer networks handle cross-rollup atomicity, and what are the MEV implications of sequencer ordering across multiple rollups? The 'based rollup' concept where L1 proposers sequence L2 transactions deserves mention given its implications for MEV redistribution and censorship resistance.\n\nThe data availability section covers EIP-4844 and DAS adequately but neglects the emerging ecosystem of modular DA layers. Celestia's Tendermint-based consensus with data availability sampling, EigenDA's restaking-based security model, and their respective trust assumptions versus native Ethereum DA represent important architectural choices that rollup developers must evaluate. The DAC threshold assumptions mentioned (5-of-9) need more rigorous treatment\u2014what happens during committee member unavailability? How are committee members selected and rotated?\n\nThe forced inclusion analysis is good but should address the interaction between forced inclusion and sequencer MEV more formally. A sequencer seeing a forced transaction in the delayed inbox can front-run it in the current batch, extracting value before the forced inclusion deadline. This creates a censorship-extraction equivalence that undermines the censorship resistance guarantees.\n\nThe 7-day dispute window justification is honest about the lack of rigorous optimization, but this is actually a significant open research question. Recent work on optimistic protocols suggests that adaptive dispute windows based on stake-weighted attestations could reduce withdrawal delays while maintaining security\u2014this deserves mention.\n\nFinally, the complete absence of bridge security analysis is a critical gap. Cross-layer communication is fundamental to L2 utility, and the security models differ dramatically between canonical rollup bridges (which inherit rollup security) and third-party bridges (which introduce additional trust assumptions). The withdrawal delay mechanism, escape hatch designs, and upgrade key security are essential topics that must be addressed for this to be a comprehensive analysis.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a mechanism design perspective, this manuscript has significant gaps that undermine its claim to be a 'comprehensive analysis.' The most glaring omission is the complete absence of fee market analysis. Post-EIP-4844, the blob fee market operates as a separate EIP-1559-style mechanism with its own base fee dynamics, yet this is not discussed. Similarly, L2-specific fee mechanisms differ substantially: Arbitrum uses a sophisticated two-dimensional pricing model separating L2 computation from L1 data costs, while Optimism employs a simpler fee scalar approach. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for evaluating L2 economics.\n\nThe sequencer incentive analysis is particularly weak. The manuscript acknowledges centralized sequencing but fails to analyze the economic implications. Sequencers currently capture significant value through transaction ordering - estimates suggest $50-100M annually across major L2s - yet this is not quantified. The manuscript mentions MEV in passing but doesn't analyze how L2 MEV differs from L1 (shorter block times, centralized ordering, cross-domain MEV opportunities). Proposed decentralized sequencer designs (shared sequencing, based rollups, leader rotation) have profound economic implications that deserve rigorous treatment.\n\nThe economic security analysis, while touching on bond sizing and challenge incentives, lacks the formal rigor expected. A proper analysis would include: (1) minimum viable attack cost calculations for each rollup type, (2) comparison of economic security budgets (e.g., Arbitrum's sequencer bond vs. zkSync's prover stake vs. Ethereum's validator stake), (3) analysis of how security scales with TVL and whether current parameters are appropriately calibrated. The manuscript mentions a $1M bond for Arbitrum but doesn't analyze whether this is economically sufficient given current TVL of $15B - the ratio suggests potential undercollateralization.\n\nThe prover economics section is a positive addition but remains incomplete. It should include analysis of the prover fee market design, how proving rights are allocated, and the equilibrium dynamics of prover competition. The cartel risk discussion is qualitative; a quantitative analysis of concentration thresholds and their economic implications would strengthen this section.\n\nFinally, the capital efficiency comparison between optimistic and ZK rollups deserves more attention. The 7-day withdrawal delay represents significant capital lockup costs that affect user behavior and liquidity provision. Fast withdrawal services (bridges, liquidity providers) have emerged to address this, creating their own economic dynamics that should be analyzed.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a ZK cryptography perspective, this manuscript demonstrates competent understanding of the field but falls short of the depth expected for a comprehensive technical analysis. The proof system comparison table is useful but oversimplified - Groth16 verification is listed as ~200K gas, but this varies significantly with the number of public inputs (each additional public input adds ~6K gas for the scalar multiplication). Similarly, the PLONK+KZG verification cost depends heavily on the number of custom gates and lookup arguments used.\n\nThe treatment of polynomial commitment schemes is adequate but misses important nuances. For KZG, the manuscript correctly identifies the trusted setup requirement but doesn't discuss the degree bound implications - the SRS size must exceed the maximum polynomial degree, which for zkSync Era's circuits means ceremonies producing millions of powers of tau. The security reduction from q-SDH to knowledge soundness deserves more attention, particularly the concrete security loss in the AGM.\n\nThe recursive proof composition section is one of the stronger parts, but the Nova/Sangria discussion could be expanded. The claim of '~10,000 constraints per folding step' for Nova is approximately correct for the basic scheme but doesn't account for the final decider proof, which still requires a full SNARK. The manuscript should clarify that Nova provides IVC efficiency but the final verification still incurs substantial cost.\n\nFor STARKs, the FRI protocol description is superficial. The security of FRI depends critically on the number of queries, the blowup factor, and the grinding parameter - none of which are discussed. The claim of 'post-quantum security' is correct but should note that this assumes the hash function (typically Poseidon or Rescue for algebraic efficiency) remains secure against quantum attacks, which is believed but not proven.\n\nThe prover benchmark table is valuable but should include standard deviation or ranges, as proving times vary dramatically with transaction composition. A batch of simple transfers proves much faster than a batch containing complex DeFi interactions. Additionally, the manuscript should discuss prover parallelization strategies - both intra-proof parallelism (parallel MSM, parallel FFT) and inter-proof parallelism (proving multiple batches simultaneously).\n\nFinally, the zkEVM type classification is well-presented, but the constraint count estimates need citations or methodology explanation. The claim that Type-1 requires '>100 million constraints per block' appears to be an estimate rather than a measured value, and the basis for this estimate should be clarified.",

Beyond the truncation, reviewers identified substantive gaps in economic analysis (fee markets, sequencer MEV dynamics, formal attack cost modeling) and technical depth (proof aggregation techniques, soundness composition under recursion, data availability layer analysis). These omissions prevent the manuscript from achieving the comprehensive coverage its scope implies.\n\nWhile the existing content is of reasonable quality (average score 6.9), the combination of incomplete sections and missing analytical frameworks represents too significant a gap for minor revision. The authors have demonstrated capability in the completed portions, suggesting these issues are addressable with focused effort rather than fundamental reconceptualization.",

        "key_weaknesses": [
          "Manuscript is truncated mid-sentence in Section 5.2, leaving bridge security models, withdrawal mechanisms, and major ZK rollup implementations (Polygon zkEVM, Scroll) entirely unaddressed",
          "Economic analysis lacks rigor: no treatment of L2 fee market mechanisms, sequencer MEV dynamics, or formal attack cost modeling with capital requirement calculations",
          "Sequencer decentralization and data availability solutions receive only superficial coverage despite being critical to L2 security and liveness guarantees"

        "required_changes": [
          "Complete all truncated sections, including full coverage of bridge security models (canonical vs third-party bridges, historical exploit analysis), withdrawal delay mechanisms, and cross-layer communication protocols",
          "Add dedicated analysis of L2 fee market mechanisms and sequencer economics, including MEV extraction quantification, fee elasticity analysis, and comparison of fee models across major rollups",
          "Expand technical coverage to include: (1) proof aggregation techniques beyond recursion (SnarkPack, batch verification), (2) formal soundness composition analysis under recursion, (3) off-chain DA layers (Celestia, EigenDA) with their trust assumptions and integration patterns"
        ],
        "recommendation": "The manuscript demonstrates solid technical foundations but is currently incomplete in ways that prevent publication. Authors should: (1) First and foremost, complete all truncated sections\u2014this is non-negotiable; (2) Add a dedicated section on L2 economics covering fee markets, sequencer revenue, and formal attack cost modeling; (3) Expand sequencer decentralization coverage to include based rollups, shared sequencer proposals, and formal liveness properties; (4) Include rigorous treatment of proof aggregation and soundness composition. The existing content quality suggests these additions are within the authors' capability. A thorough revision addressing these gaps would likely result in a strong contribution suitable for acceptance.",
