        "Critically incomplete treatment of proof systems: no discussion of Groth16 vs PLONK trade-offs, polynomial commitment schemes (KZG, FRI, IPA), or the specific proving systems used by each protocol (e.g., zkSync uses PLONK+KZG, Polygon zkEVM uses a custom SNARK)",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a zero-knowledge cryptography perspective, this manuscript requires substantial revision to meet academic standards. The claim that SNARKs produce '200-300 byte' proofs is imprecise\u2014Groth16 proofs are ~128 bytes (2 G1 + 1 G2 elements), while PLONK proofs are typically 400-800 bytes depending on the polynomial commitment scheme. The verification cost comparison is similarly incomplete: Groth16 verification requires a single pairing check (~200k gas), while PLONK verification involves multiple scalar multiplications and polynomial evaluations with different gas profiles. The manuscript states zkSync Era uses 'SNARKs' without specifying it employs PLONK with KZG commitments, which has fundamentally different properties than Groth16. Similarly, Polygon zkEVM uses a custom SNARK construction that deserves detailed analysis. The discussion of trusted setup is oversimplified\u2014modern universal SNARKs (PLONK, Marlin) require only a one-time universal setup rather than per-circuit ceremonies, which is a crucial distinction. The treatment of proof aggregation is particularly weak: there's no discussion of how recursive composition works (verifying a proof within a proof), the overhead of recursion-friendly hash functions, or the distinction between proof aggregation (combining multiple proofs into one) and proof recursion (proving verification of previous proofs). For a comprehensive analysis, the manuscript should address: (1) the specific arithmetization schemes (R1CS, PLONKish, AIR) and their implications for circuit design; (2) the concrete verification costs on Ethereum for each proof system; (3) the prover hardware requirements and decentralization implications; and (4) the security assumptions beyond 'discrete logarithm'\u2014specifically, the knowledge-of-exponent assumption for Groth16 and the algebraic group model for PLONK.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain economics and mechanism design perspective, this manuscript represents a missed opportunity. The technical architecture sections are competent but the economic analysis\u2014which should be central to understanding L2 sustainability and security\u2014is treated as an afterthought. The fee structure discussion in Section 7.1 merely lists cost components without analyzing how fees are determined, how they respond to demand fluctuations, or how different L2s have implemented (or failed to implement) efficient pricing mechanisms. There is no discussion of whether current L2 fee markets achieve allocative efficiency or how they compare to Ethereum's EIP-1559 mechanism.\n\nThe sequencer economics discussion is particularly weak given its importance. Centralized sequencers represent a fundamental departure from blockchain's trust-minimization goals, yet the manuscript offers no analysis of the economic incentives that might lead to sequencer misbehavior, the costs of such misbehavior to users, or the mechanism design challenges in transitioning to decentralized sequencing. The brief mention of 'shared sequencer networks' ignores critical questions: How are sequencer rewards distributed? What prevents collusion? How do different sequencer selection mechanisms affect censorship resistance and MEV extraction?\n\nThe security economics section is essentially absent. For optimistic rollups, there is no analysis of the economic security provided by fraud proofs: What is the minimum bond size needed to ensure honest verification? How does the 7-day challenge period affect capital efficiency? What are the game-theoretic equilibria in the fraud proof game? For ZK rollups, there is no discussion of prover economics: How are provers compensated? What prevents prover centralization? How do proof generation costs affect the minimum viable batch size and thus user experience?\n\nThe revenue figures in Table 7.2 are presented without context or analysis. What are the cost structures underlying these revenues? Are these protocols economically sustainable without token subsidies? How do sequencer margins compare across protocols and what explains the variation? The manuscript should model the long-term economic sustainability of different L2 business models, particularly as competition intensifies and data availability costs decline with full danksharding.\n\nFinally, the token economics discussion is superficial. The statement that ARB has 'no direct fee capture mechanism' deserves deeper analysis\u2014what are the implications for token value accrual and governance incentive alignment? How does Optimism's retroactive public goods funding mechanism actually work economically, and what evidence exists for its effectiveness? These are fundamental questions for understanding L2 ecosystem evolution that the manuscript leaves unaddressed.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems and consensus perspective, this manuscript misses several critical technical dimensions. The sequencer discussion acknowledges centralization risks but fails to analyze the actual consensus mechanisms proposed for decentralization\u2014Espresso's HotShot BFT variant, Astria's CometBFT-based approach, and based rollup proposer selection all have distinct liveness and safety properties that deserve formal comparison. The claim that 'users can typically force inclusion through L1 mechanisms after delay periods' glosses over the substantial complexity here: forced inclusion requires users to pay L1 gas costs, may have censorship-resistance delays of 12-24 hours on some rollups, and creates MEV opportunities during the delay window. The paper should quantify these parameters across protocols.\n\nThe data availability treatment is particularly concerning given its centrality to rollup security. The manuscript correctly distinguishes rollups from validiums but doesn't analyze the cryptographic and game-theoretic foundations of data availability sampling, which is essential for understanding full danksharding's security model. The 2D Reed-Solomon encoding, the sampling requirements for probabilistic guarantees, and the relationship between blob count and reconstruction probability are all absent. Similarly, the emerging ecosystem of modular DA layers (Celestia, EigenDA, Avail) receives no technical analysis despite their growing adoption.\n\nBridge security analysis should go beyond listing incidents to provide a formal threat model. The 7-day withdrawal delay in optimistic rollups is presented as a simple parameter, but its game-theoretic justification\u2014ensuring sufficient time for fraud proof submission under network delays and censorship attacks\u2014deserves rigorous treatment. The paper should analyze the capital efficiency implications: $45B TVL with 7-day delays implies substantial opportunity costs that fast bridges address through liquidity provision, introducing their own trust assumptions around LP collateralization and oracle reliability.\n\nThe comparative tables are useful but lack the metrics most relevant to distributed systems analysis: time-to-finality under various adversarial assumptions, censorship resistance quantification, and formal security parameter comparisons. The TVL and TPS figures, while informative for market context, don't constitute rigorous technical evaluation.",

    "meta_review": "The three reviewers converge on a consistent assessment: this manuscript provides a well-organized, clearly written survey of Ethereum L2 technologies with accurate high-level categorizations, but falls significantly short of the technical depth expected for a rigorous academic contribution. All reviewers praised the taxonomic structure distinguishing optimistic rollups, ZK rollups, validiums, and state channels, as well as the comprehensive coverage of major implementations. However, the manuscript reads more as an industry overview than a research paper.\n\nThe weaknesses identified are substantial and span all three critical dimensions of L2 analysis. Reviewer 1 highlights the superficial treatment of zero-knowledge cryptography\u2014missing proof system internals (Groth16 vs PLONK vs FRI), prover efficiency metrics, and recursive proof composition techniques. Reviewer 2 identifies severe underdevelopment of economic analysis, including absent formal modeling of fee markets, inadequate MEV treatment, and no economic security analysis. Reviewer 3 notes critical gaps in distributed systems concerns: sequencer design lacks formal MEV analysis, data availability omits erasure coding and DAS parameters, and bridge security lacks formal security models. The novelty scores (all 4/10) indicate the work does not advance the field beyond existing knowledge.\n\nDespite these significant shortcomings, the foundation is sound. The organizational structure, accuracy of high-level descriptions, and comprehensive protocol coverage provide a solid base for revision. The issues raised are addressable through substantial additions rather than fundamental restructuring, making this suitable for major revision rather than rejection.",
