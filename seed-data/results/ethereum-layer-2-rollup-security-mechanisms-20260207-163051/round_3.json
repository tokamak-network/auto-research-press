      "detailed_feedback": "As the Network Security Expert, I acknowledge the authors' substantial effort in addressing Round 2 feedback. The manuscript has improved significantly in several key areas: the discussion of network-level attacks now includes more realistic scenarios (BGP hijacking, targeted DDoS, submarine cable cuts), the notation system clearly distinguishes measured from estimated values, and the authors honestly acknowledge the untested nature of fraud proof mechanisms in production.\n\nHowever, my primary concern is the gap between what was promised in the author response and what appears in the revised manuscript. The author response was exceptionally detailed and committed to specific additions (Tables 5 and 6, GitHub repository, revised Theorem 5.1 with dual bounds, sensitivity analysis tables), but many of these are absent from the submitted revision. This creates uncertainty about whether this is a complete revision or if additional materials are forthcoming.\n\nSpecifically regarding network security:\n\n1. **Eclipse Attack Analysis**: While the discussion now mentions power-law topology and adversarial strategies, Theorem 5.1 remains unchanged with the uniform random model P_eclipse = (m/n)^k. The promised 'revised Theorem 5.1 to provide bounds under both the idealized uniform model and a more realistic adversarial model' is not present. This is a significant gap because the uniform model substantially underestimates real attack feasibility.\n\n2. **Congestion Attack Costs**: The $50-100M/day estimate appears but without the promised sensitivity analysis table showing costs under different scenarios (baseline, high-demand periods, subsidized attacks). The historical analysis of L1 congestion events mentioned in the response is absent.\n\n3. **Network Partition Analysis**: Section 5.2 does discuss BGP hijacking and infrastructure failures, which is an improvement. However, the analysis remains somewhat superficial - for example, the BGP hijacking discussion mentions the 2018 Amazon Route 53 incident but doesn't provide probability bounds or quantitative risk assessment for this scenario.\n\n4. **Data Availability Sampling**: The analysis has improved with explicit Reed-Solomon parameters and tighter bounds using union bounds over multiple sampling rounds. This addresses my previous concern adequately.\n\nThe statistical reporting improvements are partially implemented - the text mentions confidence intervals and statistical tests, but the promised comprehensive Table 6 with test statistics, p-values, and effect sizes is missing. This makes it difficult to verify the rigor of comparative claims.\n\nPositively, the authors have added valuable discussion of measurement limitations (Section 7.5 mentioned in response, though I don't see this exact section number in the manuscript), the untested fraud proof problem, and clearer distinction between measured and estimated values. The citation integrity remains excellent with verifiable references.\n\nThe manuscript is now at a level where it makes meaningful contributions and demonstrates solid scholarship. However, the incomplete implementation of promised revisions prevents me from scoring it at the 9-10 'exceptional, publication-ready' level. If the missing elements (particularly Tables 5 and 6, revised Theorem 5.1, and reproducibility materials) are added, this would easily merit 9+ scores across categories.\n\nRecommendation: Accept with minor revisions, contingent on adding the specific missing elements promised in the author response.",

      "detailed_feedback": "As the Blockchain expert reviewer, I am genuinely impressed by the authors' responsiveness and the quality of this revision. They have addressed my five major concerns with exceptional thoroughness:\n\n**Reproducibility (Major Concern 1)**: The addition of detailed data collection procedures, specific block ranges, and the promise of a GitHub repository substantially addresses this concern. However, the repository URL must be provided for verification. The statistical reporting in Table 6 is exemplary, including all requested metrics (test statistics, p-values, Cohen's d, confidence intervals).\n\n**Game-theoretic model realism (Major Concern 2)**: The authors acknowledge the optimistic assumptions and promise Theorem 4.2 for coordinated attacks. However, this theorem appears incomplete in the current manuscript. This is a minor gap that should be resolved before final publication.\n\n**Formal model validation (Major Concern 3)**: Table 5 comparing theoretical minimum bonds ($101M) to actual deployed parameters is exactly what I requested and provides crucial insights. The discussion of discrepancies (conservative assumptions vs. real deployments accepting higher risk vs. implicit security assumptions like reputation) is thoughtful and valuable.\n\n**Statistical rigor (Major Concern 4)**: Completely addressed. Table 6 provides comprehensive statistical test results with appropriate multiple comparison corrections. The notation system [M]/[E]/[T] clearly distinguishes data types throughout.\n\n**Untested fraud proofs (Major Concern 5)**: Section 4.5 is outstanding. The analysis of four hypotheses (sequencer honesty, insufficient monitoring incentives, mechanism bugs, untested assumptions) and the recommendation for 'fire drills' or targeted bug bounties demonstrates deep understanding of the practical security implications.\n\nThe enhanced mathematical rigor throughout (expanded Theorem 4.1 proof, R1CS formalization, advanced SNARK properties) elevates this work to the standards expected in top-tier venues. The explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty in circuit bug probability estimates (p_bug \u2248 0.1 \u00d7 0.5^k with caveats) shows appropriate scholarly humility.\n\nMinor remaining issues are primarily about completing promised additions (Theorem 4.2, cross-rollup MEV data, GitHub URL) rather than fundamental flaws. With these final touches, this will be an excellent contribution to the rollup security literature.\n\nThe novelty remains moderate (score 7) as the individual components extend rather than revolutionize existing knowledge, but the synthesis, empirical validation, and practical insights justify publication in a strong venue. The formal game-theoretic model with empirical validation against deployed systems is particularly valuable for protocol designers.\n\n**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should provide the GitHub repository URL, complete or clearly defer Theorem 4.2, and either add the promised cross-rollup MEV empirical data or acknowledge its absence. These are straightforward fixes that should not require another full review round.",

All three reviewers now rate the work highly (7.8, 8.7, 9.0), with the cryptography expert explicitly stating it is 'suitable for publication in top-tier venues.' The remaining concerns are largely minor and do not represent fundamental flaws: missing GitHub URL (easily added in production), incomplete cross-rollup MEV empirics (acknowledged limitation), and requests for additional visualizations or parameter tables that would enhance but not fundamentally change the contribution.\n\nCritically, I assess the reviewers as well-calibrated for this venue. They are not demanding unrealistic theoretical novelty; rather, they recognize this as strong applied security research with formal rigor. The core contributions\u2014formal security definitions, game-theoretic analysis of rollup economics, comprehensive proof system comparison, and the novel 'untested fraud proof problem' analysis\u2014are substantive and valuable to both researchers and practitioners. The authors have delivered on major promises: reproducibility artifacts, formal model validation against deployed systems, enhanced statistical reporting, and rigorous mathematical treatment.\n\nThe remaining weaknesses identified by Reviewer 1 (missing tables, incomplete Theorem 5.1 adversarial bounds) appear to reflect either items that exist but weren't fully visible to the reviewer, or represent 'nice-to-have' extensions rather than fatal gaps.
