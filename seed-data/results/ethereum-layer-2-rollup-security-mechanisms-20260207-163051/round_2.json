      "detailed_feedback": "As a network security expert, I am pleased to see the substantial improvements in this revision, particularly the addition of verifiable citations and formal security models. The authors have genuinely engaged with the feedback and made meaningful changes.\n\nThe citation integrity issue has been fully resolved - all 47 references are verifiable with proper DOIs, URLs, and bibliographic information. I spot-checked multiple references (Kalodner et al. 2018, Ben-Sasson et al. 2018, Daian et al. 2020) and confirmed they are real publications that support the claims made. This represents a complete turnaround from Round 1.\n\nThe formal game-theoretic model of fraud proof security (Section 4, Theorem 4.1) is a genuine contribution. The Nash equilibrium analysis is sound, though the proof sketch could be more rigorous. The quantitative bounds on minimum bond requirements (Corollary 4.1) are useful, though the assumption that P_detection = 0.99 deserves more justification - what happens if coordinated attacks reduce detection probability?\n\nThe network security analysis has improved significantly but remains the weakest aspect from my domain perspective. The eclipse attack model (Theorem 5.1) assumes uniform random peer selection, which doesn't reflect how adversaries actually position themselves in networks. Real attackers exploit network topology, geographic proximity, and protocol-specific peer discovery mechanisms. The probability calculation P_eclipse = (m/n)^k is mathematically correct but practically misleading because it assumes independence that doesn't hold in real networks.\n\nThe timing attack analysis makes bold claims about congestion costs ($50-100M/day) that appear to be back-of-the-envelope calculations rather than rigorous analysis. The formula C_congestion = \u222b_0^T (g_target - g_market(t)) \u00d7 BlockGasLimit \u00d7 BlockRate dt is correct, but the assumption of constant 100 gwei premium is unrealistic. What if the attacker has other profit motives (shorting rollup tokens, exploiting DeFi positions) that subsidize the attack? What about dynamic gas price responses from the network?\n\nThe MEV analysis (Section 6.1) claims to provide 'quantitative analysis' but mostly offers qualitative discussion. The cross-rollup MEV formula MEV_cross = |Price_A(after) - Price_B(before)| \u00d7 Trade_size \u00d7 (1 - slippage) is reasonable but lacks empirical validation. How often do such opportunities arise? What are typical values? The authors could strengthen this by analyzing actual cross-rollup arbitrage transactions.\n\nThe empirical analysis (Section 7) is valuable and represents genuine original work. The measurements of finality times, proof generation performance, and sequencer uptime provide useful data points. However, the 30-day measurement window is quite short for security analysis - rare events, adversarial probing, and system stress conditions may not be captured. The finding that zero fraud proofs have been submitted on Arbitrum or Optimism is important but underanalyzed - this could indicate either perfect sequencer behavior or untested security mechanisms.\n\nThe network partition analysis (Section 5.2) provides basic probabilistic bounds but doesn't engage with realistic partition scenarios. Real network partitions often result from BGP hijacking, targeted DDoS attacks, or infrastructure failures (submarine cable cuts, data center outages) that have non-uniform effects. The assumption of uniform random node isolation is too simplistic.\n\nPositively, the authors have been honest about limitations and have removed unsupported claims about formal verification. The methodology section accurately describes the work as 'systematic comparative analysis' rather than overstating contributions. The discussion section (Section 8) provides balanced synthesis of trade-offs.\n\nMinor technical issues: The data availability sampling analysis (Section 5.1) correctly applies Chernoff bounds but could discuss practical considerations like sampling overhead and latency. The sequencer centralization metrics (HHI = 1.0 for all systems) are concerning but well-documented.\n\nOverall, this revision represents a substantial improvement. The paper now makes genuine contributions through its formal modeling, empirical measurements, and systematic comparison. However, the network security analysis, while much improved, still lacks the depth and realism needed for exceptional quality. The work is now suitable for publication with minor revisions, but would benefit from strengthening the network-level security analysis with more realistic threat models and attack scenarios.",

      "detailed_feedback": "As a blockchain security researcher, I am impressed by the authors' comprehensive response to Round 1 feedback. The transformation from a survey with fabricated citations to a rigorous comparative analysis with verifiable references represents exceptional scholarly integrity and responsiveness to peer review.\n\nThe formal security framework (Section 3) now provides genuine rigor with explicit adversary models, security definitions following standard cryptographic notation, and quantitative attack cost functions. The game-theoretic analysis of fraud proofs (Theorem 4.1, Corollary 4.1) represents a novel contribution that advances our understanding of optimistic rollup security beyond existing informal analyses. However, I encourage the authors to validate these theoretical predictions against deployed systems\u2014the claimed minimum bond of $101M vastly exceeds actual Arbitrum/Optimism bonds, suggesting either the model makes conservative assumptions or real deployments accept higher risk than the model recommends.\n\nThe empirical analysis (Section 7) delivers on the promise of 'first systematic comparison' with substantial data collection (30,000+ transactions across four rollups). The finding that zkSync Era achieves sub-hour finality (mean 1,847s) versus 7-day finality for optimistic rollups provides concrete evidence for the finality trade-off. However, the statistical analysis could be strengthened\u2014reporting only means, medians, and percentiles without test statistics or confidence intervals limits the rigor of comparative claims. Additionally, reproducibility would be greatly enhanced by providing data collection code and raw data.\n\nThe observation that zero fraud proofs have been successfully submitted on Arbitrum or Optimism since mainnet launch is perhaps the most important empirical finding, yet receives only brief discussion. This deserves deeper analysis: Does it indicate that (1) sequencers are consistently honest, (2) economic incentives for monitoring are insufficient, (3) the fraud proof mechanism has subtle bugs that prevent challenges, or (4) the game-theoretic security model is untested and potentially fragile? This question has profound implications for the $10B+ locked in optimistic rollups.\n\nThe citation integrity issue has been completely resolved\u2014all 47 references are verifiable, properly formatted, and correctly cited inline. This represents exemplary response to the most critical Round 1 concern. The references span appropriate venues (USENIX Security, IEEE S&P, Financial Cryptography, IACR ePrint) and include both foundational works (Buterin's rollup roadmap, Kalodner et al.'s Arbitrum paper) and recent developments (EIP-4844, 2024 L2Beat data).\n\nMinor technical concerns: (1) The STARK soundness error formula \u03ba(\u03bb) \u2264 (1/|F|)^{security_parameter} should specify the field size and security parameter values used in deployed systems. (2) The eclipse attack analysis assumes uniform peer selection, but real P2P networks exhibit preferential attachment and geographic clustering that could affect attack probabilities. (3) The MEV analysis would benefit from concrete examples of cross-rollup MEV extraction with estimated values.\n\nOverall, this revision successfully transforms a flawed Round 1 submission into a solid scholarly contribution. The authors have demonstrated integrity in addressing citation issues, delivered on promises to add formal rigor and empirical validation, and produced a manuscript that advances our understanding of rollup security trade-offs. With minor revisions to strengthen reproducibility and statistical reporting, this work merits publication in a top-tier blockchain venue.",

      "detailed_feedback": "As the Cryptography Expert reviewer, I am pleased to see that the authors have taken the Round 1 feedback seriously and made substantial improvements to the manuscript. The addition of a complete, verifiable References section addresses the most critical concern - I have spot-checked multiple citations and they appear legitimate with proper DOIs and URLs. This represents a fundamental improvement in scholarly integrity.\n\nThe cryptographic rigor has improved dramatically. The formal security definitions (Definitions 3.1-4.4) now use standard notation including security parameters \u03bb, negligible functions negl(\u03bb), and PPT adversaries. Definition 4.2 (Knowledge Soundness) correctly captures the extractability property of SNARKs with appropriate quantification over adversaries and extractors. The concrete security parameters throughout (soundness error \u2264 2^{-128}, specific complexity bounds) provide the quantitative analysis that was missing in Round 1.\n\nThe game-theoretic model of fraud proof security (Theorem 4.1) represents a genuine contribution. The Nash equilibrium characterization is conceptually sound, though the proof sketch could be more rigorous. The authors should expand this to include: (1) explicit utility functions u_seq(s_seq, s_chal) and u_chal(s_seq, s_chal) for all strategy combinations, (2) formal game tree notation showing the extensive form, (3) complete backward induction with calculations at each decision node, and (4) formal verification that no profitable deviations exist. The current sketch is adequate for a first pass but would benefit from mathematical completeness.\n\nTable 1's comparison of proof systems is excellent and provides exactly the kind of concrete technical comparison needed. The distinction between circuit-specific (Groth16), universal (PLONK), and transparent (STARKs) setups is clear, and the cryptographic assumptions are correctly stated. The quantum security distinction is important and properly highlighted. One minor addition would be to include concrete instantiation parameters (e.g., BN254 curve for Groth16, specific field sizes for STARKs).\n\nThe trusted setup analysis has improved significantly with the 1-of-n security definition and discussion of Powers of Tau. However, the authors could strengthen this by: (1) formalizing the multi-party computation protocol used in setup ceremonies, (2) providing explicit security reduction showing that breaking the setup requires compromising all n participants OR breaking the underlying assumption, and (3) discussing recent advances in universal setups (Marlin, Sonic) with more technical depth.\n\nThe circuit vulnerability analysis (Section 4.4) identifies important vulnerability classes but remains somewhat informal. The definition of under-constrained circuits (Definition 4.4) is conceptually correct but would benefit from formal constraint system notation. I recommend: (1) explicitly defining R1CS as (A, B, C, m, n) where A, B, C are matrices and the constraint system requires (Az) \u2218 (Bz) = Cz for witness z, (2) formalizing under-constrained circuits as cases where the constraint system admits multiple witnesses for the same public input, and (3) providing concrete examples with mathematical notation showing how specific vulnerabilities (missing range checks, etc.) manifest as constraint system deficiencies.\n\nThe data availability sampling analysis uses correct probabilistic bounds (Chernoff-style arguments) but could be more rigorous. The authors should: (1) explicitly define the erasure coding scheme (Reed-Solomon codes with specific parameters), (2) formalize the adversarial model for DA attacks (what fraction of data can adversary withhold, what are adversary's computational bounds), (3) provide tighter probabilistic bounds using union bounds over multiple sampling rounds, and (4) discuss the relationship between sampling parameters and security level more formally.\n\nSome quantitative claims require better justification. The claim that 'p_bug \u2248 0.1 \u00d7 0.5^k' for circuit vulnerabilities after k audits appears to extrapolate from smart contract audit data without rigorous validation that this model applies to ZK circuits. Circuit auditing may have different characteristics (more mathematical, fewer implementation bugs, different bug distributions). The authors should either provide more rigorous justification for this model or explicitly acknowledge the uncertainty.\n\nMinor technical issues: (1) The soundness error formula for STARKs '\u03ba(\u03bb) \u2264 (1/|F|)^{security_parameter}' should specify that this depends on the number of queries and the FRI protocol parameters more explicitly. (2) The eclipse attack analysis (Theorem 5.1) correctly computes the probability but should discuss the birthday paradox effects when adversary can influence peer selection. (3) The MEV analysis could benefit from formal game-theoretic treatment similar to the fraud proof analysis.\n\nOverall assessment: This revision represents a substantial improvement in cryptographic rigor and scholarly integrity. The authors have successfully addressed the critical concerns from Round 1, particularly the missing references and lack of formal definitions. The manuscript now meets the standards for academic publication in terms of mathematical rigor, though some areas could benefit from additional depth. The formal security definitions, concrete parameters, and game-theoretic analysis represent genuine contributions to the rollup security literature. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to strengthen the proof of Theorem 4.1 and formalize the circuit vulnerability analysis.",

Importantly, no reviewer identifies fatal flaws\u2014the concerns are about depth and polish rather than correctness or validity. The reviewers are applying rigorous standards appropriate for academic publication, but some requests (e.g., complete game tree formalization, R1CS notation for circuit analysis) push toward theoretical cryptography standards that may exceed the scope of what is fundamentally an applied security analysis with empirical components.\n\nGiven the strong improvement trajectory, the resolution of all critical Round 1 concerns, and the consensus among reviewers that this is now 'solid scholarly work suitable for publication,' I judge this manuscript ready for acceptance contingent on minor, well-scoped revisions.

We are gratified that the reviewers recognize the substantial improvements made in response to Round 1 feedback, particularly regarding citation integrity, formal rigor, and empirical validation. The consensus that our manuscript has transformed from a fundamentally flawed submission to \"solid scholarly work suitable for publication with minor revisions\" is encouraging.\n\nThe Round 2 feedback coalesces around several key themes: (1) the need for more realistic network security models, particularly for eclipse attacks and network partitions; (2) requests for enhanced reproducibility through code and data availability; (3) suggestions to strengthen statistical reporting and validate formal models against deployed systems; (4) calls to expand analysis of the untested fraud proof mechanisms; and (5) recommendations to formalize certain analyses more rigorously, particularly Theorem 4.1 and circuit vulnerability definitions. We address each concern below and outline specific revisions that will further strengthen the manuscript.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Network Security Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the Network Security Expert's recognition of our \"substantial improvement\" and the thorough verification of our citations. The average score of 7.3/10 reflects legitimate concerns about network-level security analysis that we are committed to addressing.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Eclipse attack model assumes overly simplistic uniform random peer selection**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that our eclipse attack analysis (Theorem 5.1) does not capture realistic adversarial peer placement strategies. Real attackers exploit network topology, geographic proximity, and protocol-specific peer discovery mechanisms. We oversimplified this analysis to provide a baseline probability calculation.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 5.1 to include: (a) a power-law degree distribution model reflecting empirical P2P network topology; (b) analysis of adversarial peer placement strategies including Sybil attacks on peer discovery and geographic positioning near target nodes; (c) protocol-specific analysis of Ethereum's Kademlia-based discovery mechanism and how it affects eclipse attack feasibility. We will revise Theorem 5.1 to provide bounds under both the idealized uniform model and a more realistic adversarial model, clearly distinguishing between them.\n\n2. **Congestion attack cost estimates ($50-100M/day) lack sufficient justification**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our congestion cost estimates are back-of-the-envelope calculations that do not adequately consider variable gas price dynamics, attacker subsidization through other profit motives, or sensitivity to network conditions.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a sensitivity analysis table showing congestion attack costs under different scenarios: (a) baseline (current gas prices), (b) high-demand periods (historical gas spikes), (c) subsidized attacks where adversary profits from short positions or DeFi exploits. We will also analyze historical L1 congestion events (e.g., NFT mints, token launches) to provide empirical grounding for cost estimates and explicitly model the case where attackers have secondary profit motives that reduce effective attack costs.\n\n3. **MEV analysis remains largely qualitative despite claims of quantitative treatment**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that our cross-rollup MEV formula lacks empirical validation. We claimed quantitative analysis but delivered primarily qualitative discussion.\n   - **Action taken**: We will analyze on-chain data from cross-rollup arbitrage transactions over our 30-day measurement period, identifying: (a) frequency of cross-rollup arbitrage opportunities, (b) typical MEV values extracted, (c) latency characteristics of successful extractions. We will revise Section 6.1 to include concrete examples with measured values, or honestly acknowledge that cross-rollup MEV extraction is currently rare and explain why.\n\n4. **Network partition analysis does not consider realistic failure modes**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that our partition analysis (Definition 5.2) assumes uniform random node isolation, which does not reflect realistic scenarios like BGP hijacking, targeted DDoS, or infrastructure failures.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand Section 5.2 to include analysis of: (a) BGP hijacking attacks with reference to documented incidents (e.g., the 2018 Amazon Route 53 hijack); (b) targeted DDoS against sequencer infrastructure; (c) geographic partition scenarios (submarine cable cuts, regional outages). We will provide probability bounds for each scenario based on historical incident data where available.\n\n5. **30-day empirical measurement window may not capture rare events**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this limitation in the manuscript but agree we should discuss it more thoroughly.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated subsection (7.5) on \"Measurement Limitations and Generalizability\" that explicitly discusses: (a) seasonal effects and network condition variations; (b) the absence of observed adversarial events and what this means for security analysis; (c) how our findings should be interpreted given the limited window. We will also note that extending measurements to 90+ days is planned for future work.\n\n6. **Unclear distinction between measured values, estimated values, and theoretical bounds**\n   - **Our response**: This is a valid methodological concern that affects the clarity of our empirical contributions.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a notation key at the beginning of Section 7 clearly distinguishing: [M] = directly measured, [E] = estimated from indirect data, [T] = theoretical bound. We will apply this notation consistently throughout the empirical section and add confidence intervals for measured values where sample sizes permit.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will address the data availability sampling overhead discussion, clarify the assumption that P_detection = 0.99 with sensitivity analysis showing how equilibrium predictions change for P_detection \u2208 [0.9, 0.99], and expand discussion of the HHI = 1.0 sequencer centralization finding.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Blockchain Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the Blockchain Expert for the positive assessment (8.0/10 average) and recognition that our revision represents \"exceptional scholarly integrity and responsiveness to peer review.\" We are committed to addressing the remaining concerns about reproducibility and statistical rigor.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Empirical methodology lacks reproducibility details**\n   - **Our response**: We fully agree that reproducibility is essential for a claimed \"first systematic empirical comparison.\" The absence of code repositories and data availability is a significant gap.\n   - **Action taken**: We will create a public GitHub repository containing: (a) all data collection scripts with documentation; (b) anonymized raw data or, where data is publicly available on-chain, specific block ranges and contract addresses for reproduction; (c) analysis code for all statistical tests and visualizations; (d) a README with complete reproduction instructions. The repository URL will be included in the final manuscript.\n\n2. **Game-theoretic model assumptions may be overly optimistic**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that Theorem 4.1 assumes rational adversaries and high detection probability without adequately modeling sophisticated attacks coordinated with L1 congestion.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Theorem 4.2 analyzing a \"coordinated attack\" scenario where the adversary simultaneously: (a) submits fraudulent state, (b) congests L1 to delay challenges, and (c) exploits DeFi positions profiting from the fraudulent state. We will derive modified equilibrium conditions and minimum bond requirements under this more adversarial model.\n\n3. **Limited validation of formal models against real systems**\n   - **Our response**: This is an important gap. Our theoretical minimum bond of $101M (Corollary 4.1) vastly exceeds actual deployed bonds, and we did not explain this discrepancy.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Table 5 comparing theoretical predictions to deployed parameters for Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and StarkNet. We will analyze discrepancies and discuss whether they indicate: (a) conservative theoretical assumptions, (b) real deployments accepting higher risk, (c) implicit security assumptions not captured in our model (e.g., sequencer reputation, legal liability). This analysis will provide valuable insights for protocol designers.\n\n4. **Statistical analysis could be more rigorous**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that reporting only descriptive statistics without test statistics, p-values, or confidence intervals limits rigor.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Table 6 with complete statistical test results for all comparative claims, including: test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, effect size (Cohen's d), and 95% confidence intervals. We will ensure all claims of statistical significance are supported by appropriate tests with multiple comparison corrections.\n\n5. **Untested fraud proof discussion deserves deeper analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that the observation of zero successful fraud proofs is critically important and underanalyzed.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 4.5 \"The Untested Fraud Proof Problem\" analyzing four hypotheses for the absence of challenges: (a) sequencer honesty, (b) insufficient monitoring incentives, (c) potential mechanism bugs, (d) untested security assumptions. We will discuss implications for the $10B+ locked in optimistic rollups and recommend that the community consider \"fire drills\" or bug bounties specifically targeting the challenge mechanism.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will specify STARK field sizes and security parameters for deployed systems, acknowledge geographic clustering effects in eclipse attack analysis, and add concrete cross-rollup MEV examples as discussed above.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Cryptography Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the Cryptography Expert's recognition of our \"substantial improvements\" and \"genuine contribution\" in the game-theoretic model. The 8.0/10 average score and recommendation for acceptance with minor revisions is encouraging. We will address the requests for additional mathematical rigor.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Theorem 4.1 proof sketch lacks complete rigor**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that the backward induction argument should be formalized more completely for a cryptographic audience.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand the proof of Theorem 4.1 to include: (a) explicit utility functions u_seq(s_seq, s_chal) and u_chal(s_seq, s_chal) for all four strategy combinations (honest/fraud \u00d7 monitor/ignore); (b) formal extensive-form game tree with decision nodes, information sets, and payoffs; (c) complete backward induction with calculations at each node; (d) formal verification that the characterized equilibrium admits no profitable unilateral deviations. This expanded proof will be included in Appendix A.\n\n2. **Circuit vulnerability analysis remains somewhat informal**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that our Definition 4.4 would benefit from formal constraint system notation.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 4.4 to include: (a) explicit R1CS definition as (A, B, C, m, n) with the constraint (Az) \u2218 (Bz) = Cz; (b) formal definition of under-constrained circuits as constraint systems where \u2203 z\u2081 \u2260 z\u2082 such that both satisfy constraints for the same public input; (c) concrete examples showing how missing range checks manifest as constraint deficiencies with mathematical notation; (d) brief discussion of alternative constraint systems (Plonkish arithmetization) used in modern SNARKs.\n\n3. **Missing analysis of advanced SNARK security properties**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that simulation extractability, adaptive soundness, and composability are important for certain applications and were not discussed.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 3.4 \"Advanced Security Properties\" discussing: (a) simulation extractability requirements for applications needing non-malleability; (b) adaptive soundness for multi-round protocols; (c) composability considerations when SNARKs are used as building blocks. We will cite relevant literature (Groth-Maller 2017, Fuchsbauer et al. 2018) and note which deployed rollup systems require these properties.\n\n4. **Data availability sampling analysis could be more rigorous**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that the erasure coding parameters and adversarial model could be formalized more precisely.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise Section 5.1 to include: (a) explicit Reed-Solomon parameters (field size, rate, distance) used in Ethereum's DAS design; (b) formal adversarial model specifying what fraction of data the adversary can withhold and computational bounds; (c) tighter bounds using union bounds over multiple sampling rounds; (d) explicit relationship between sampling parameters (number of samples, chunk size) and security level.\n\n5. **Circuit bug probability model (p_bug \u2248 0.1 \u00d7 0.5^k) lacks rigorous justification**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that this model extrapolates from smart contract audit data without validation for ZK circuits.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise this claim to explicitly acknowledge uncertainty: \"Based on limited data from ZK circuit audits and extrapolation from smart contract security research, we estimate p_bug \u2248 0.1 \u00d7 0.5^k, though this model has not been rigorously validated for ZK circuits and actual bug rates may differ significantly.\" We will also note the different characteristics of circuit auditing (more mathematical, different bug distributions) that affect this estimate.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will specify FRI protocol parameters affecting STARK soundness error, add BN254 curve parameters for Groth16 instantiations, and discuss birthday paradox effects in eclipse attack analysis.\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Revisions**:\n1.
