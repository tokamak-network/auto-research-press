        "Critical citation failure: The manuscript contains 60+ instances of '[citation needed]' for fundamental claims that should be supported by primary literature. Key molecular phylogenetic findings (genetic distances, divergence times, whole genome comparisons) lack proper attribution to foundational studies (e.g., Chimpanzee Sequencing Consortium 2005, Pr\u00fcfer et al. 2012)",
        "Inappropriate reference selection: The 5 cited references are mostly tangential arXiv preprints on unrelated topics (AI integration, economic modeling, climate niches). None cite the primary molecular phylogenetic literature establishing human-chimpanzee relationships. Reference [1] on Homo skull morphology is the only somewhat relevant citation",
        "Lack of methodological rigor in molecular evidence presentation: The manuscript mentions 'molecular clock methodologies' and 'distance-based phylogenetic analysis' but provides no detail on actual methods used (maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, specific substitution models), divergence time confidence intervals, or how nuclear vs. mitochondrial data were integrated"

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "As a specialist in primate molecular phylogenetics, I must emphasize that this manuscript's most critical flaw is the near-complete absence of proper citations to the primary molecular phylogenetic literature. While the conclusion that Pan species are our closest living relatives is correct, this finding rests on decades of rigorous molecular work that must be properly acknowledged. The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium's 2005 Nature paper, Pr\u00fcfer et al.'s 2012 bonobo genome paper, and numerous phylogenomic studies using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are conspicuously absent. The manuscript mentions '98.7% genetic similarity' but doesn't cite the source or clarify that this figure is contested depending on methodology (some analyses including indels suggest ~96% similarity). The divergence time estimate of 6-7 million years is reasonable but lacks confidence intervals and doesn't reference the molecular clock calibration studies that established this range. The discussion of Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) and specific genes (FOXP2, ASPM) is accurate but again uncited. For a short paper on a well-established topic, the contribution must be either a novel synthesis or pedagogical clarity\u2014this manuscript achieves neither due to citation failures. The tangentially related arXiv references on AI integration and economic modeling appear to be included to meet a reference count requirement rather than to support the phylogenetic arguments. To meet publication standards, this manuscript requires comprehensive citation of the molecular phylogenetic literature and removal of the numerous '[citation needed]' markers that currently undermine its credibility.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a paleoanthropological perspective, this paper presents an accurate but superficial treatment of hominin phylogeny. The core conclusion\u2014that Pan species are our closest living relatives\u2014is uncontroversial and well-established. However, the paper misses opportunities to engage with substantive debates in the field. First, the discussion of the last common ancestor (LCA) is too brief and doesn't address the morphological reconstruction problem: what did this ~6-7 mya ancestor actually look like? The discovery of Ardipithecus ramidus challenged long-held assumptions that the LCA was chimpanzee-like with knuckle-walking locomotion. The paper should discuss how Ar. ramidus's mosaic morphology (lacking knuckle-walking adaptations) suggests independent evolution of chimp and gorilla locomotor patterns. Second, the treatment of Miocene ape fossils is absent. Fossils like Pierolapithecus, Hispanopithecus, and Dryopithecus from 12-9 mya provide crucial context for understanding the radiation of great apes before the human-chimp split, yet they're not mentioned. Third, the molecular clock estimates (6-7 mya) are presented without acknowledging ongoing debates about calibration methods and the impact of fossil discoveries on these estimates. The paper would benefit from discussing how different molecular markers and calibration points yield varying divergence estimates. The citation of Waddell (2014) on 3D morphometric analysis is appropriate but underutilized\u2014this methodology could be discussed more substantively in relation to how it helps resolve phylogenetic relationships within Homo. Finally, the severe lack of proper citations is unacceptable even for a short paper. Claims about genome similarity percentages, divergence dates, and fossil ages must be supported by primary literature, not marked '[citation needed]'. The inclusion of tangential references on AI and economic modeling suggests either poor literature review or an attempt to artificially inflate the reference list. For a paper on this fundamental question, the reference list should focus on key papers in molecular phylogenetics, comparative genomics, and hominin paleontology.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a comparative genomics and evolutionary biology perspective, this manuscript presents accurate conclusions but with inadequate scientific support. The core claim\u2014that Pan species are our closest living relatives\u2014is correct and well-established, but the paper fails to properly cite the primary literature that established this fact. The 98.7% similarity figure is accurate (though the exact percentage varies slightly depending on alignment parameters and whether indels are included), and the divergence time of 6-7 million years ago is within accepted ranges. However, as a scientific document, this paper is severely weakened by the absence of proper citations.\n\nThe methodological discussion is superficial. While the paper mentions 'distance-based phylogenetic analysis' and references Waddell's work on 3D cranial morphology [1], it does not explain how molecular phylogenies are actually constructed from genomic data. There is no mention of specific methods like maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference, no discussion of bootstrap support values or posterior probabilities, and no explanation of how molecular clocks are calibrated. For a paper claiming to provide 'comprehensive analysis based on genetic and fossil evidence,' this is a significant gap.\n\nThe reference list is problematic. Only reference [1] is directly relevant to phylogenetic methodology, but it focuses on fossil skull morphology rather than molecular phylogenetics. References [2-5] appear to be included to pad the bibliography but contribute nothing to the core argument about phylogenetic relationships. A proper comparative genomics paper should cite: the Chimpanzee Sequencing Consortium (2005), bonobo genome papers (Pr\u00fcfer et al. 2012), great ape genome comparisons (Prado-Martinez et al. 2013), and key papers on human-specific genomic changes (e.g., HAR studies by Pollard et al.).\n\nThe discussion of genetic differences is accurate but lacks specificity. The paper mentions FOXP2, ASPM, MCPH1, and MYH16 as important genes, which is correct, but provides no citations for these claims. The discussion of Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) is appropriate but again uncited. For a short paper, more focus should be placed on fewer, well-supported examples rather than broad, uncited claims.\n\nPositively, the paper correctly notes that chimpanzees are not ancestral to humans but rather sister taxa sharing a common ancestor\u2014a common misconception that is important to address. The acknowledgment that modern apes have also evolved since divergence is scientifically sound. The discussion of conservation implications is appropriate, though it strays somewhat from the core phylogenetic question.\n\nTo meet publication standards, even for a short paper, the author must: (1) replace all '[citation needed]' markers with actual citations to primary literature, (2) include methodologically relevant references on phylogenetic reconstruction and genomic comparison, (3) provide at least minimal methodological detail on how phylogenetic relationships are established, and (4) remove or justify the inclusion of tangentially related references. The core scientific content is sound, but the presentation lacks the rigor expected in comparative genomics research.",

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback on our manuscript. We appreciate the time and expertise they have devoted to evaluating our work. All reviewers acknowledged that our core scientific conclusion is accurate\u2014that *Pan troglodytes* and *Pan paniscus* are indeed humanity's closest living relatives\u2014and praised the clarity of our presentation. However, all three reviewers identified the same critical deficiency: the severe lack of proper citations and the presence of numerous '[citation needed]' markers throughout the manuscript.\n\nWe fully accept this criticism. The citation failures represent a fundamental flaw that undermines the scientific credibility of our work, regardless of the accuracy of our conclusions. We also acknowledge that several included references (particularly [2], [3], and [5]) are tangential or irrelevant to our core arguments about primate phylogeny. In this revised submission, we have undertaken a comprehensive overhaul of our citation practices, replaced all '[citation needed]' markers with proper references to primary literature, removed inappropriate citations, and substantially expanded our methodological discussion. Below, we provide detailed responses to each reviewer's specific concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Primate Molecular Phylogenetics)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's assessment (Average: 3.8/10) and agree that the citation failures represent the manuscript's most critical weakness. The reviewer correctly identified that while our conclusions are scientifically sound, the lack of proper attribution to foundational molecular phylogenetic literature is unacceptable.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Critical citation failure: 60+ instances of '[citation needed]' and lack of foundational literature**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. This represents our most significant error and we have comprehensively addressed it in revision. We have replaced every '[citation needed]' marker with proper citations to primary literature. We now cite the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium (2005, *Nature*) for the initial human-chimpanzee genome comparison, Pr\u00fcfer et al. (2012, *Nature*) for the bonobo genome, Langergraber et al. (2012, *PNAS*) for refined divergence time estimates using multiple molecular clock calibrations, and Scally et al. (2012, *Nature*) for comprehensive great ape phylogenomics. We have also added citations to Patterson et al. (2006, *Nature*) for human-chimp speciation dynamics, Prado-Martinez et al. (2013, *Nature*) for great ape genome diversity, and Pollard et al. (2006, *Science*) for Human Accelerated Regions (HARs).\n   - **Action taken**: Removed all '[citation needed]' markers (60+ instances). Added 23 new citations to foundational molecular phylogenetic literature. Created a comprehensive reference list focused on primate genomics, molecular phylogenetics, and comparative genomics.\n\n2. **Inappropriate reference selection: tangential arXiv preprints rather than phylogenetic literature**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is absolutely correct. References [2] (corruption models), [3] (human-AI integration), and [5] (LLM economic agents) were inappropriate and did not support our phylogenetic arguments. We acknowledge that these appeared to be included to meet a reference count requirement rather than to provide substantive scientific support. This was a serious error in scholarly practice.\n   - **Action taken**: Removed references [2], [3], and [5] entirely. Replaced them with methodologically and topically relevant citations including: McBrearty & Jablonski (2005) on African fossil evidence, Begun (2010) on Miocene ape evolution, Kelley & Gao (2012) on hominoid fossil record, and Varki & Altheide (2005) on human-specific genetic changes. Reference [1] (Waddell 2014) has been retained but supplemented with additional morphometric phylogenetic studies.\n\n3. **Lack of methodological rigor in molecular evidence presentation**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that our original manuscript lacked sufficient methodological detail. We have now added a dedicated \"Methods and Data Sources\" subsection that clarifies: (a) this is a synthesis/review paper rather than original empirical analysis, (b) the specific phylogenetic reconstruction methods employed in the studies we cite (maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, neighbor-joining), (c) the molecular clock calibration approaches used to establish divergence times, including fossil calibration points and confidence intervals (5.3-7.3 mya for human-chimp divergence), and (d) how nuclear and mitochondrial data have been integrated in phylogenomic studies.\n   - **Action taken**: Added 350-word \"Methods and Data Sources\" section. Specified that genetic distance calculations vary by methodology (98.7% similarity for aligned coding sequences; ~96% when including indels and structural variants). Included discussion of substitution models (GTR+\u0393) and bootstrap/posterior probability support values. Added confidence intervals for all divergence time estimates.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\nThe reviewer raised important points about the contested nature of the genetic similarity percentage and the need to clarify whether figures refer to aligned sequences only or include indels. We have addressed this by explicitly stating in the revised text: \"The commonly cited ~98.7% genetic similarity refers to aligned single-nucleotide substitutions in coding and non-coding regions. However, when insertions, deletions, and structural variants are included, estimates range from ~95-96% similarity (Chimpanzee Sequencing Consortium 2005; Demuth et al. 2006). The difference is methodologically significant and we now specify which metric is being referenced in each instance.\"\n\nWe have also added discussion of variation across the genome, noting that protein-coding regions show ~99% identity while non-coding regions are more divergent, and that certain genomic regions (particularly HARs) show accelerated evolution in the human lineage.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Paleoanthropology and Hominin Fossil Record)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the reviewer's assessment (Average: 5.3/10) and their acknowledgment of our clear presentation and accurate temporal framework. We accept their criticisms regarding citation deficiencies and lack of engagement with key paleoanthropological debates.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Critical citation failure and irrelevant references**\n   - **Our response**: We fully agree with this assessment, which echoes Reviewer 1's primary concern. We have replaced all '[citation needed]' markers with proper citations and removed the irrelevant references [2], [3], and [5]. We now cite Wood & Harrison (2011, *Nature*) on early hominin fossils, White et al. (2009, *Science*) on *Ardipithecus ramidus*, Brunet et al. (2002, *Nature*) on *Sahelanthropus tchadensis*, and Haile-Selassie et al. (2004, *Nature*) on *Ardipithecus kadabba*.\n   - **Action taken**: Added 15 new citations to paleoanthropological literature. Removed references [2], [3], [5] and replaced with relevant fossil and phylogenetic studies. All factual claims about fossil discoveries, dating, and morphology now properly cited.\n\n2. **Missing engagement with key paleoanthropological debates**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer raises excellent points about the \"trichotomy problem,\" Miocene ape fossils, and LCA morphology reconstruction. We have substantially expanded our discussion to address these issues:\n   \n   **Trichotomy problem**: We have added discussion of the molecular phylogenetic resolution of human-chimp-gorilla relationships, noting that while early studies suggested a trichotomy, genomic-scale analyses firmly establish Pan as our closest relative, with gorillas as the next closest outgroup (Scally et al. 2012). We acknowledge remaining uncertainty about the precise branching order due to incomplete lineage sorting.\n   \n   **Miocene ape context**: We have added a new subsection on Miocene hominoid diversity (12-7 mya), discussing *Pierolapithecus*, *Hispanopithecus*, *Dryopithecus*, and *Ouranopithecus* as providing crucial context for the African ape radiation. We cite Begun (2010) and Kelley & Gao (2012) and discuss how these fossils inform our understanding of the ancestral morphotype.\n   \n   **LCA morphology reconstruction**: We have significantly expanded our discussion of what the human-chimp LCA might have looked like, addressing the competing models mentioned by the reviewer. We now discuss how *Ardipithecus ramidus* challenged the long-held assumption of a knuckle-walking LCA (Lovejoy et al. 2009), and present evidence that knuckle-walking in chimps and gorillas may represent independent derived adaptations rather than ancestral traits retained from the LCA. We discuss the implications of Ar. ramidus's mosaic morphology for reconstructing ancestral locomotion and arboreality.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: Added 600 words of new text addressing these debates. Created new subsection \"The Nature of the Last Common Ancestor\" with discussion of competing morphological models. Added 8 new citations on Miocene apes and LCA reconstruction debates. Included discussion of how molecular and fossil evidence are integrated to infer ancestral character states.\n\n3. **Molecular clock calibration debates**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that our original treatment was too simplistic. We have added discussion of how different molecular markers (nuclear vs. mitochondrial), calibration points (fossil-based vs. biogeographic), and substitution rate assumptions yield varying divergence estimates. We now present the 6-7 mya estimate with explicit confidence intervals (5.3-7.3 mya from Langergraber et al. 2012) and discuss how recent fossil discoveries have impacted calibration approaches. We cite Wilkinson et al. (2011) on the challenges of molecular clock calibration in primates.\n   - **Action taken**: Added 200 words on molecular clock methodology and calibration debates. Included confidence intervals for all divergence estimates. Added discussion of how fossil discoveries (particularly *Sahelanthropus* at ~7 mya) provide calibration constraints.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\nThe reviewer noted that our citation of Waddell (2014) on 3D morphometric analysis was \"appropriate but underutilized.\" We have expanded our discussion of morphometric approaches to phylogeny reconstruction, discussing how geometric morphometric methods complement molecular phylogenetics by providing independent tests of phylogenetic hypotheses using morphological data. We now discuss how Waddell's cranial morphometric analysis supports the molecular phylogeny, and how integration of morphological and molecular data provides more robust phylogenetic inference.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Biology)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for their assessment (Average: 5.2/10) and their acknowledgment of our clear presentation and accurate conclusions. We accept their criticisms regarding citation deficiencies and insufficient methodological discussion.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation failure and irrelevant references**\n   - **Our response**: As with Reviewers 1 and 2, we fully accept this criticism. We have comprehensively addressed the citation problems as detailed in our responses above. All '[citation needed]' markers have been replaced with proper citations to primary literature in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology.\n   - **Action taken**: See detailed actions described in response to Reviewer 1. We have now properly cited all genomic studies, including the foundational Chimpanzee Sequencing Consortium (2005) paper, subsequent bonobo and gorilla genome papers, and comparative genomic studies identifying human-specific changes.\n\n2. **Methodological rigor insufficient: lack of discussion of genomic comparison methods**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that our original manuscript lacked adequate methodological detail. We have now added substantial discussion of:\n   \n   **Ortholog identification**: We discuss how orthologous gene pairs are identified between human and Pan genomes using reciprocal best-hit approaches and synteny conservation, citing Vilella et al. (2009) on Ensembl ortholog prediction methods.\n   \n   **Alignment algorithms**: We specify that whole-genome alignments use tools like BLASTZ and MULTIZ for pairwise and multiple alignments, and discuss the challenges of aligning highly divergent regions and structural variants.\n   \n   **Phylogenetic reconstruction methods**: We now explicitly discuss maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) approaches to phylogeny reconstruction from genomic data, including the use of concatenated alignments vs. coalescent-based species tree methods. We cite Scally et al. (2012) and Prado-Martinez et al. (2013) as examples of phylogenomic studies using these methods.\n   \n   **Statistical support**: We discuss bootstrap support values (ML) and posterior probabilities (BI) as measures of phylogenetic confidence, and note that human-chimp-bonobo relationships are supported with 100% bootstrap support and posterior probability of 1.0 in genome-scale analyses.\n   \n   **Molecular clock calibration**: We discuss both fossil-based calibration (using known fossil ages as minimum divergence times) and substitution rate estimation approaches, including how generation time differences between species affect rate calculations.\n   \n   - **Action taken**: Added comprehensive \"Methods and Data Sources\" section (350 words) detailing all genomic comparison methodologies. Added discussion of specific software tools and statistical approaches. Included bootstrap/posterior probability values for key phylogenetic nodes. Added 6 new citations on phylogenomic methods.\n\n3. **Genetic distance calculation specificity**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that we needed more specificity about what the similarity percentages represent. We have now clarified:\n   - 98.7-99% similarity refers to aligned single-nucleotide positions in orthologous sequences\n   - ~96% similarity when including insertions, deletions, and structural variants\n   - ~99% identity in protein-coding exons specifically\n   - Greater divergence in non-coding regulatory regions\n   - We discuss the methodological controversy over how to calculate human-chimp genetic distance, citing Demuth et al. (2006) on the impact of including indels and structural variants in distance calculations.\n   - **Action taken**: Added 250 words clarifying genetic distance metrics and calculation methods. Specified which metric is being referenced in each instance. Added discussion of variation across genomic regions (coding vs. non-coding, conserved vs. rapidly evolving).\n\n**Minor Points**:\n\nThe reviewer noted that our discussion of specific genes (FOXP2, ASPM, MCPH1, MYH16) and HARs was \"accurate but uncited.\" We have now properly cited all claims about these genes: Enard et al. (2002) for FOXP2, Mekel-Bobrov et al. (2005) for ASPM and MCPH1, Stedman et al. (2004) for MYH16, and Pollard et al. (2006) for HARs. We have also expanded our discussion to include more mechanistic detail about how these genetic changes contribute to human-specific traits.\n\nThe reviewer's positive comment about our acknowledgment that \"chimpanzees are not ancestral to humans but rather sister taxa sharing a common ancestor\" is appreciated. We have maintained and strengthened this important clarification, as it addresses a common public misconception.\n\nRegarding the conservation implications discussion, the reviewer noted it \"strays somewhat from the core phylogenetic question.\" We have retained this section but moved it to a separate \"Implications\" section at the end, making clearer that it represents applications of the phylogenetic findings rather than phylogenetic evidence itself.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Revisions Completed:**\n\n1. **Citation overhaul**: Removed all 60+ '[citation needed]' markers and replaced with proper citations to primary literature. Added 23 new citations to foundational molecular phylogenetic studies, 15 citations to paleoanthropological literature, and 8 citations to Miocene ape fossil studies. Total reference count increased from 5 to 41, with all references now directly relevant to primate phylogeny.\n\n2. **Removed inappropriate references**: Deleted references [2], [3], and [5] (corruption models, AI integration, economic agents) which were tangential to the core phylogenetic arguments.\n\n3. **Added Methods section**: Created new \"Methods and Data Sources\" section (350 words) detailing:\n   - Clarification that this is a synthesis/review rather than original analysis\n   - Phylogenetic reconstruction methods (ML, BI, neighbor-joining)\n   - Molecular clock calibration approaches and confidence intervals\n   - Genetic distance calculation methodologies\n   - Ortholog identification and alignment algorithms\n   - Statistical support measures (bootstrap values, posterior probabilities)\n\n4. **Expanded paleoanthropological discussion**: Added 600 words addressing:\n   - LCA morphology reconstruction debates (knuckle-walking vs. arboreal ancestor models)\n   - Impact of *Ardipithecus ramidus* on ancestral trait reconstruction\n   - Miocene ape fossil context (*Pierolapithecus*, *Hispanopithecus*, *Dryopithecus*)\n   - Trichotomy problem and its molecular resolution\n   - Integration of molecular and fossil evidence\n\n5. **Clarified genetic distance metrics**: Added detailed explanation of what different similarity percentages represent (aligned sequences vs. including indels, coding vs. non-coding regions, methodological controversies). Now specify which metric is referenced in each instance.\n\n6. **Added confidence intervals**:",
