Reference list expanded from 5 to 36 citations, all directly relevant to primate phylogenetics.",

Reference [26] (Haile-Selassie et al. 2004, Nature, 412:178-181) appears to have incorrect volume/page numbers - the actual Ardipithecus kadabba paper is Haile-Selassie 2001, Nature 412:178-181. Reference [8] (Demuth et al. 2006) on indel evolution may not be the most direct citation for human-chimp genetic distance calculations.",
        "Incomplete molecular clock discussion: While confidence intervals are now provided (5.3-7.3 mya), the manuscript could better explain the sources of uncertainty. Different molecular markers (nuclear vs. mitochondrial), calibration approaches (fossil-based vs. biogeographic), and generation time assumptions yield varying estimates. The cited Langergraber et al. 2012 study is excellent but represents one approach among several.",
        "Limited discussion of incomplete lineage sorting: The manuscript mentions this phenomenon (p. 5) but doesn't adequately explain its implications for phylogenetic inference. Given that ~15-30% of the genome shows discordant gene trees due to ILS in the human-chimp-gorilla trichotomy (Scally et al. 2012), this deserves more attention as it affects interpretation of genetic distance calculations."

        "Expand molecular clock uncertainty discussion: Add 2-3 sentences explaining why divergence time estimates vary (e.g., 'Estimates vary depending on molecular markers used: mitochondrial DNA suggests slightly earlier divergence (7-8 mya) while nuclear genome estimates center on 6-7 mya. Generation time assumptions significantly affect rate calculations, with longer generation times in great apes yielding older divergence estimates').",
        "Clarify incomplete lineage sorting implications: Add brief explanation such as: 'Incomplete lineage sorting means that for approximately 15-30% of genomic regions, individual gene trees may show alternative topologies (e.g., human-gorilla or chimp-gorilla groupings). However, the species tree based on genome-wide data unambiguously supports the human-chimp clade with maximal statistical support'."

      "detailed_feedback": "As a specialist in primate molecular phylogenetics, I am impressed by the thoroughness of this revision. The authors have genuinely engaged with all three reviewers' feedback and implemented nearly all suggested changes. The transformation from a manuscript with 60+ '[citation needed]' markers to one with 36 properly cited references represents exceptional responsiveness to peer review.\n\nThe molecular phylogenetic content is now accurate and appropriately supported. The distinction between different genetic distance metrics (98.7% for aligned sequences vs. 95-96% including indels) is crucial and well-explained. The addition of confidence intervals for divergence times (5.3-7.3 mya) and specification of phylogenetic methods (ML, BI) brings the manuscript up to field standards. The discussion of bootstrap support (100%) and posterior probabilities (1.0) for the human-Pan clade appropriately conveys the strength of phylogenetic evidence.\n\nThe expanded discussion of the last common ancestor (LCA) morphology and the impact of Ardipithecus ramidus is particularly strong. The authors correctly note that Ar. ramidus challenges the traditional assumption of a knuckle-walking LCA, and they appropriately present this as an ongoing debate rather than settled fact. The discussion of independent evolution of knuckle-walking in Pan and Gorilla (citing Kivell & Schmitt 2009) represents sophisticated engagement with current paleoanthropological thinking.\n\nMy remaining concerns are minor. The reference verification issue (Haile-Selassie citation) appears to be a typographical error rather than a conceptual problem. The molecular clock discussion, while improved, could benefit from slightly more detail on sources of uncertainty - but this is a refinement rather than a fundamental flaw. The incomplete lineage sorting discussion is adequate for a short synthesis paper, though a specialist audience would appreciate more detail.\n\nFor a short paper (1,500-2,500 words) synthesizing existing knowledge, this manuscript now meets publication standards. The core scientific claims are accurate, properly supported, and clearly presented. The authors have demonstrated genuine scholarly engagement with peer review feedback. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the reference verification issue and consider the suggested clarifications on molecular clock uncertainty and incomplete lineage sorting.\n\nOverall assessment: This revision represents a dramatic improvement from Round 1 (3.8/10 average) to publication-worthy quality (8.2/10 average). The authors should be commended for their thorough and thoughtful response to reviewer feedback.",

      "detailed_feedback": "As a comparative genomics expert, I am genuinely impressed by the authors' comprehensive response to Round 1 reviews. The transformation from a manuscript with 60+ '[citation needed]' markers to one with 36 properly integrated citations represents exceptional revision work. The core scientific conclusion\u2014that Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus are humanity's closest living relatives\u2014is now supported by appropriate citation to foundational genomic studies.\n\nThe methodological improvements are substantial. The clarification that genetic similarity varies from 98.7% (aligned single-nucleotide positions) to ~96% (including indels and structural variants) to ~99% (protein-coding exons only) demonstrates proper understanding of how genomic distance metrics are calculated and reported. This addresses my Round 1 concern about specificity in genetic distance calculations. The addition of confidence intervals for divergence time estimates (5.3-7.3 Mya) and explicit mention of phylogenetic support values (100% bootstrap, 1.0 posterior probability) strengthens the quantitative rigor.\n\nThe expanded discussion of LCA morphology reconstruction, particularly the impact of Ardipithecus ramidus on our understanding of ancestral locomotion, shows genuine engagement with current paleoanthropological debates. The argument that knuckle-walking in chimps and gorillas may represent independent derived traits rather than ancestral features is well-presented and properly cited (Lovejoy et al. 2009, Kivell & Schmitt 2009).\n\nHowever, some concerns remain. While the citation count has dramatically improved, I cannot independently verify all references without DOIs. Some reference details appear potentially problematic (e.g., Kelley & Gao 2012 with the unusual title about 'vitalism', Haile-Selassie et al. 2004 in Nature 412 which seems chronologically inconsistent). For a comparative genomics paper, providing DOIs for all major papers is standard practice and would facilitate verification.\n\nThe phylogenomic methods discussion, while much improved, could still benefit from more technical depth. Specifically, the manuscript mentions incomplete lineage sorting but doesn't explain how genome-scale analyses address this issue through coalescent-based species tree methods. The distinction between gene trees and species trees, and how modern phylogenomic approaches reconcile discordance among gene trees, would strengthen the methodological sophistication.\n\nThe molecular clock calibration discussion mentions Sahelanthropus as a calibration constraint but doesn't detail other fossil calibration points or discuss how different calibration strategies affect estimates. Given that molecular clock dating is central to establishing the 6-7 Mya divergence time, more methodological detail would be appropriate.\n\nDespite these remaining areas for improvement, this revision demonstrates that the authors have taken reviewer feedback seriously and made genuine, substantive improvements. The manuscript now meets the standards for scholarly rigor expected in comparative genomics, with proper attribution to foundational literature and appropriate methodological discussion. For a short paper (1,500-2,500 words), the scope and depth are now appropriate. The work makes a solid contribution to synthesizing current understanding of human-Pan relationships based on genomic and fossil evidence.\n\nMy overall assessment is that this manuscript has improved from 'weak, major revisions required' (Round 1: 3.8/10) to 'strong, minor improvements needed' (Round 2: 8.2/10). With the addition of DOIs and minor methodological expansions suggested above, this would be publication-ready for a review/synthesis paper in the field.",

      "detailed_feedback": "As a paleoanthropologist specializing in hominin fossil records, I am impressed by the authors' comprehensive response to Round 1 reviews. The transformation from a citation-deficient manuscript to one with 36 properly referenced claims represents exemplary engagement with peer review. The core scientific conclusion\u2014that Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus are humanity's closest living relatives\u2014is now properly supported by foundational literature including the Chimpanzee Sequencing Consortium (2005), Pr\u00fcfer et al. (2012), and Scally et al. (2012).\n\nThe most significant improvement from a paleoanthropological perspective is the substantive engagement with LCA morphology reconstruction debates. The discussion of how Ardipithecus ramidus challenges the knuckle-walking ancestor hypothesis (citing Lovejoy et al. 2009 and Kivell & Schmitt 2009) demonstrates sophisticated understanding of current controversies. The authors correctly note that Ar. ramidus lacks knuckle-walking adaptations and exhibits a mosaic of arboreal and bipedal features, suggesting that Pan and Gorilla knuckle-walking may represent independent derived traits rather than ancestral retentions. This is a critical point that addresses a common misconception in popular accounts of human evolution.\n\nThe integration of Miocene ape context (Pierolapithecus, Hispanopithecus, Dryopithecus, Ouranopithecus) citing Begun (2010) and Kelley & Gao (2012) is appropriate and demonstrates understanding that the human-chimp LCA emerged from a diverse radiation of Miocene hominoids. However, the treatment could be strengthened by discussing how these fossils inform character polarity decisions\u2014which traits are ancestral vs. derived in the human-chimp clade?\n\nThe molecular clock discussion now includes confidence intervals (5.3-7.3 Mya) and cites Langergraber et al. (2012) and Patterson et al. (2006), which is appropriate. However, the paper could better address calibration uncertainties. Different fossil calibration points yield different estimates: using Sahelanthropus at 7 Mya as a minimum constraint vs. using Ardipithecus at 4.4 Mya produces different divergence time distributions. The paper should also discuss how generation time differences between humans and apes affect molecular rate calculations (Moorjani et al. 2016).\n\nOne persistent weakness is the retention of reference [1] (Waddell 2014 arXiv preprint). An unpublished, non-peer-reviewed preprint from 2014 is not an appropriate foundational reference for a synthesis paper, especially when published morphometric phylogenetic studies are available (Harvati et al. 2019; Mounier & Miraz\u00f3n Lahr 2019). This should be corrected.\n\nThe paper's treatment of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is too brief. Given that ~15-30% of the human genome shows gene tree discordance due to ILS in the human-chimp-gorilla trichotomy (Scally et al. 2012; Hobolth et al. 2011), this phenomenon deserves more explanation. ILS occurs when ancestral polymorphisms persist through rapid speciation events, causing different genomic regions to support different phylogenetic relationships. This is not 'noise' but rather an expected consequence of the short time interval between gorilla divergence (~10 Mya) and human-chimp divergence (~6-7 Mya).\n\nFinally, the paper would benefit from brief discussion of recent fossil discoveries that impact our understanding of early hominin evolution. Graecopithecus freybergi (Fuss et al. 2017), potentially dated to 7.2 Mya in southeastern Europe, challenges the exclusively African origin of the human-chimp divergence. Danuvius guggenmosi (B\u00f6hme et al. 2019), a 11.6 Mya Miocene ape from Germany showing evidence of bipedalism combined with arboreal adaptations, further challenges simple models of locomotor evolution. While these don't change the core conclusion about Pan being our closest living relative, they add important context about the complexity of late Miocene hominoid evolution.\n\nDespite these remaining weaknesses, this revision represents publication-quality work for a short synthesis paper. The authors have demonstrated genuine engagement with paleoanthropological literature and debates, and the manuscript now provides an accurate, well-supported answer to the research question. With minor revisions addressing the points above, this would be suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.",
