## Author Response - Round 1

### Overview

We sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback on our manuscript. We appreciate the time and expertise they have devoted to evaluating our work. All reviewers acknowledged that our core scientific conclusion is accurate—that *Pan troglodytes* and *Pan paniscus* are indeed humanity's closest living relatives—and praised the clarity of our presentation. However, all three reviewers identified the same critical deficiency: the severe lack of proper citations and the presence of numerous '[citation needed]' markers throughout the manuscript.

We fully accept this criticism. The citation failures represent a fundamental flaw that undermines the scientific credibility of our work, regardless of the accuracy of our conclusions. We also acknowledge that several included references (particularly [2], [3], and [5]) are tangential or irrelevant to our core arguments about primate phylogeny. In this revised submission, we have undertaken a comprehensive overhaul of our citation practices, replaced all '[citation needed]' markers with proper references to primary literature, removed inappropriate citations, and substantially expanded our methodological discussion. Below, we provide detailed responses to each reviewer's specific concerns.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Primate Molecular Phylogenetics)

**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's assessment (Average: 3.8/10) and agree that the citation failures represent the manuscript's most critical weakness. The reviewer correctly identified that while our conclusions are scientifically sound, the lack of proper attribution to foundational molecular phylogenetic literature is unacceptable.

**Major Points**:

1. **Critical citation failure: 60+ instances of '[citation needed]' and lack of foundational literature**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. This represents our most significant error and we have comprehensively addressed it in revision. We have replaced every '[citation needed]' marker with proper citations to primary literature. We now cite the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium (2005, *Nature*) for the initial human-chimpanzee genome comparison, Prüfer et al. (2012, *Nature*) for the bonobo genome, Langergraber et al. (2012, *PNAS*) for refined divergence time estimates using multiple molecular clock calibrations, and Scally et al. (2012, *Nature*) for comprehensive great ape phylogenomics. We have also added citations to Patterson et al. (2006, *Nature*) for human-chimp speciation dynamics, Prado-Martinez et al. (2013, *Nature*) for great ape genome diversity, and Pollard et al. (2006, *Science*) for Human Accelerated Regions (HARs).
   - **Action taken**: Removed all '[citation needed]' markers (60+ instances). Added 23 new citations to foundational molecular phylogenetic literature. Created a comprehensive reference list focused on primate genomics, molecular phylogenetics, and comparative genomics.

2. **Inappropriate reference selection: tangential arXiv preprints rather than phylogenetic literature**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer is absolutely correct. References [2] (corruption models), [3] (human-AI integration), and [5] (LLM economic agents) were inappropriate and did not support our phylogenetic arguments. We acknowledge that these appeared to be included to meet a reference count requirement rather than to provide substantive scientific support. This was a serious error in scholarly practice.
   - **Action taken**: Removed references [2], [3], and [5] entirely. Replaced them with methodologically and topically relevant citations including: McBrearty & Jablonski (2005) on African fossil evidence, Begun (2010) on Miocene ape evolution, Kelley & Gao (2012) on hominoid fossil record, and Varki & Altheide (2005) on human-specific genetic changes. Reference [1] (Waddell 2014) has been retained but supplemented with additional morphometric phylogenetic studies.

3. **Lack of methodological rigor in molecular evidence presentation**
   - **Our response**: We agree that our original manuscript lacked sufficient methodological detail. We have now added a dedicated "Methods and Data Sources" subsection that clarifies: (a) this is a synthesis/review paper rather than original empirical analysis, (b) the specific phylogenetic reconstruction methods employed in the studies we cite (maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, neighbor-joining), (c) the molecular clock calibration approaches used to establish divergence times, including fossil calibration points and confidence intervals (5.3-7.3 mya for human-chimp divergence), and (d) how nuclear and mitochondrial data have been integrated in phylogenomic studies.
   - **Action taken**: Added 350-word "Methods and Data Sources" section. Specified that genetic distance calculations vary by methodology (98.7% similarity for aligned coding sequences; ~96% when including indels and structural variants). Included discussion of substitution models (GTR+Γ) and bootstrap/posterior probability support values. Added confidence intervals for all divergence time estimates.

**Minor Points**:

The reviewer raised important points about the contested nature of the genetic similarity percentage and the need to clarify whether figures refer to aligned sequences only or include indels. We have addressed this by explicitly stating in the revised text: "The commonly cited ~98.7% genetic similarity refers to aligned single-nucleotide substitutions in coding and non-coding regions. However, when insertions, deletions, and structural variants are included, estimates range from ~95-96% similarity (Chimpanzee Sequencing Consortium 2005; Demuth et al. 2006). The difference is methodologically significant and we now specify which metric is being referenced in each instance."

We have also added discussion of variation across the genome, noting that protein-coding regions show ~99% identity while non-coding regions are more divergent, and that certain genomic regions (particularly HARs) show accelerated evolution in the human lineage.

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Paleoanthropology and Hominin Fossil Record)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the reviewer's assessment (Average: 5.3/10) and their acknowledgment of our clear presentation and accurate temporal framework. We accept their criticisms regarding citation deficiencies and lack of engagement with key paleoanthropological debates.

**Major Points**:

1. **Critical citation failure and irrelevant references**
   - **Our response**: We fully agree with this assessment, which echoes Reviewer 1's primary concern. We have replaced all '[citation needed]' markers with proper citations and removed the irrelevant references [2], [3], and [5]. We now cite Wood & Harrison (2011, *Nature*) on early hominin fossils, White et al. (2009, *Science*) on *Ardipithecus ramidus*, Brunet et al. (2002, *Nature*) on *Sahelanthropus tchadensis*, and Haile-Selassie et al. (2004, *Nature*) on *Ardipithecus kadabba*.
   - **Action taken**: Added 15 new citations to paleoanthropological literature. Removed references [2], [3], [5] and replaced with relevant fossil and phylogenetic studies. All factual claims about fossil discoveries, dating, and morphology now properly cited.

2. **Missing engagement with key paleoanthropological debates**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer raises excellent points about the "trichotomy problem," Miocene ape fossils, and LCA morphology reconstruction. We have substantially expanded our discussion to address these issues:
   
   **Trichotomy problem**: We have added discussion of the molecular phylogenetic resolution of human-chimp-gorilla relationships, noting that while early studies suggested a trichotomy, genomic-scale analyses firmly establish Pan as our closest relative, with gorillas as the next closest outgroup (Scally et al. 2012). We acknowledge remaining uncertainty about the precise branching order due to incomplete lineage sorting.
   
   **Miocene ape context**: We have added a new subsection on Miocene hominoid diversity (12-7 mya), discussing *Pierolapithecus*, *Hispanopithecus*, *Dryopithecus*, and *Ouranopithecus* as providing crucial context for the African ape radiation. We cite Begun (2010) and Kelley & Gao (2012) and discuss how these fossils inform our understanding of the ancestral morphotype.
   
   **LCA morphology reconstruction**: We have significantly expanded our discussion of what the human-chimp LCA might have looked like, addressing the competing models mentioned by the reviewer. We now discuss how *Ardipithecus ramidus* challenged the long-held assumption of a knuckle-walking LCA (Lovejoy et al. 2009), and present evidence that knuckle-walking in chimps and gorillas may represent independent derived adaptations rather than ancestral traits retained from the LCA. We discuss the implications of Ar. ramidus's mosaic morphology for reconstructing ancestral locomotion and arboreality.
   
   - **Action taken**: Added 600 words of new text addressing these debates. Created new subsection "The Nature of the Last Common Ancestor" with discussion of competing morphological models. Added 8 new citations on Miocene apes and LCA reconstruction debates. Included discussion of how molecular and fossil evidence are integrated to infer ancestral character states.

3. **Molecular clock calibration debates**
   - **Our response**: We agree that our original treatment was too simplistic. We have added discussion of how different molecular markers (nuclear vs. mitochondrial), calibration points (fossil-based vs. biogeographic), and substitution rate assumptions yield varying divergence estimates. We now present the 6-7 mya estimate with explicit confidence intervals (5.3-7.3 mya from Langergraber et al. 2012) and discuss how recent fossil discoveries have impacted calibration approaches. We cite Wilkinson et al. (2011) on the challenges of molecular clock calibration in primates.
   - **Action taken**: Added 200 words on molecular clock methodology and calibration debates. Included confidence intervals for all divergence estimates. Added discussion of how fossil discoveries (particularly *Sahelanthropus* at ~7 mya) provide calibration constraints.

**Minor Points**:

The reviewer noted that our citation of Waddell (2014) on 3D morphometric analysis was "appropriate but underutilized." We have expanded our discussion of morphometric approaches to phylogeny reconstruction, discussing how geometric morphometric methods complement molecular phylogenetics by providing independent tests of phylogenetic hypotheses using morphological data. We now discuss how Waddell's cranial morphometric analysis supports the molecular phylogeny, and how integration of morphological and molecular data provides more robust phylogenetic inference.

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Biology)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for their assessment (Average: 5.2/10) and their acknowledgment of our clear presentation and accurate conclusions. We accept their criticisms regarding citation deficiencies and insufficient methodological discussion.

**Major Points**:

1. **Citation failure and irrelevant references**
   - **Our response**: As with Reviewers 1 and 2, we fully accept this criticism. We have comprehensively addressed the citation problems as detailed in our responses above. All '[citation needed]' markers have been replaced with proper citations to primary literature in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology.
   - **Action taken**: See detailed actions described in response to Reviewer 1. We have now properly cited all genomic studies, including the foundational Chimpanzee Sequencing Consortium (2005) paper, subsequent bonobo and gorilla genome papers, and comparative genomic studies identifying human-specific changes.

2. **Methodological rigor insufficient: lack of discussion of genomic comparison methods**
   - **Our response**: We agree that our original manuscript lacked adequate methodological detail. We have now added substantial discussion of:
   
   **Ortholog identification**: We discuss how orthologous gene pairs are identified between human and Pan genomes using reciprocal best-hit approaches and synteny conservation, citing Vilella et al. (2009) on Ensembl ortholog prediction methods.
   
   **Alignment algorithms**: We specify that whole-genome alignments use tools like BLASTZ and MULTIZ for pairwise and multiple alignments, and discuss the challenges of aligning highly divergent regions and structural variants.
   
   **Phylogenetic reconstruction methods**: We now explicitly discuss maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) approaches to phylogeny reconstruction from genomic data, including the use of concatenated alignments vs. coalescent-based species tree methods. We cite Scally et al. (2012) and Prado-Martinez et al. (2013) as examples of phylogenomic studies using these methods.
   
   **Statistical support**: We discuss bootstrap support values (ML) and posterior probabilities (BI) as measures of phylogenetic confidence, and note that human-chimp-bonobo relationships are supported with 100% bootstrap support and posterior probability of 1.0 in genome-scale analyses.
   
   **Molecular clock calibration**: We discuss both fossil-based calibration (using known fossil ages as minimum divergence times) and substitution rate estimation approaches, including how generation time differences between species affect rate calculations.
   
   - **Action taken**: Added comprehensive "Methods and Data Sources" section (350 words) detailing all genomic comparison methodologies. Added discussion of specific software tools and statistical approaches. Included bootstrap/posterior probability values for key phylogenetic nodes. Added 6 new citations on phylogenomic methods.

3. **Genetic distance calculation specificity**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that we needed more specificity about what the similarity percentages represent. We have now clarified:
   - 98.7-99% similarity refers to aligned single-nucleotide positions in orthologous sequences
   - ~96% similarity when including insertions, deletions, and structural variants
   - ~99% identity in protein-coding exons specifically
   - Greater divergence in non-coding regulatory regions
   - We discuss the methodological controversy over how to calculate human-chimp genetic distance, citing Demuth et al. (2006) on the impact of including indels and structural variants in distance calculations.
   - **Action taken**: Added 250 words clarifying genetic distance metrics and calculation methods. Specified which metric is being referenced in each instance. Added discussion of variation across genomic regions (coding vs. non-coding, conserved vs. rapidly evolving).

**Minor Points**:

The reviewer noted that our discussion of specific genes (FOXP2, ASPM, MCPH1, MYH16) and HARs was "accurate but uncited." We have now properly cited all claims about these genes: Enard et al. (2002) for FOXP2, Mekel-Bobrov et al. (2005) for ASPM and MCPH1, Stedman et al. (2004) for MYH16, and Pollard et al. (2006) for HARs. We have also expanded our discussion to include more mechanistic detail about how these genetic changes contribute to human-specific traits.

The reviewer's positive comment about our acknowledgment that "chimpanzees are not ancestral to humans but rather sister taxa sharing a common ancestor" is appreciated. We have maintained and strengthened this important clarification, as it addresses a common public misconception.

Regarding the conservation implications discussion, the reviewer noted it "strays somewhat from the core phylogenetic question." We have retained this section but moved it to a separate "Implications" section at the end, making clearer that it represents applications of the phylogenetic findings rather than phylogenetic evidence itself.
