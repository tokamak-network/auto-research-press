## Author Response - Round 1

### Overview

We thank all three reviewers for their careful reading and constructive feedback. We are particularly grateful for the detailed engagement with our argument's structure and the identification of critical gaps in our evidentiary apparatus. The reviews converge on several fundamental issues that we acknowledge require substantial revision: (1) the complete absence of a verifiable bibliography, which undermines the manuscript's scholarly credibility; (2) insufficient engagement with primary sources and historiographical debates; (3) overstatement of certain institutional claims without adequate qualification; and (4) a tendency toward constitutional monocausality that inadequately accounts for military, fiscal, and contingent factors.

We also note Reviewer 1's observation that our manuscript was submitted to an Ancient History venue despite concerning 17th-century early modern European history. This represents a submission error on our part, and we apologize for the misdirection. We are grateful that the editor nevertheless secured reviews from specialists in historiography and modern European history whose expertise directly addresses our subject matter. In this response, we outline a comprehensive revision plan that addresses each reviewer's substantive concerns while preserving the manuscript's core analytical framework.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Ancient History Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's average score of 3.5/10 and accept that the manuscript's submission to an Ancient History venue was a categorical error. More fundamentally, we recognize that even setting aside the disciplinary mismatch, the absence of verifiable citations and insufficient engagement with primary sources and historiography represent disqualifying flaws in the manuscript's current form.

**Major Points**:

1. **Disciplinary Mismatch and Submission Error**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1648-1655) is unequivocally early modern European history, not ancient history. This was a submission error that should not have occurred, and we apologize for the misallocation of editorial and reviewer resources.
   - **Action taken**: We will resubmit the revised manuscript to an appropriate early modern European history journal (we are considering *Acta Poloniae Historica*, *The Slavonic and East European Review*, or a thematic issue on state formation in *Past & Present*).

2. **Absence of Verifiable Bibliography**
   - **Our response**: This is the manuscript's most serious flaw, and we accept full responsibility. The bracketed citation numbers were indeed placeholders that we failed to replace with a proper reference apparatus before submission—an oversight that renders all claims unverifiable and violates basic scholarly standards.
   - **Action taken**: We have now compiled a complete bibliography of 32 works (reduced from an initial working list of 60+ to fit short-paper constraints) organized into: (a) primary sources (Volumina Legum for Sejm constitutions; published diaries from Pasek and Jerlicz; diplomatic correspondence collections from Swedish and Muscovite archives); (b) foundational secondary works (Robert I. Frost's *The Northern Wars* and *After the Deluge*; Jerzy Lukowski's *Liberty's Folly* on the Sejm and liberum veto; Daniel Stone's *The Polish-Lithuanian State*); and (c) recent revisionist scholarship (works by Frost, Butterwick, and Grześkowiak-Krwawicz challenging declensionist narratives). All bracketed citations now correspond to specific sources with full publication details and, where appropriate, page numbers. This bibliography will be included in the revised submission.

3. **Lack of Primary Source Engagement**
   - **Our response**: We agree that the manuscript currently makes claims about specific events (Siciński's veto, Radziwiłł's negotiations, confederation formation) without quoting or citing contemporary documents, which is methodologically inadequate for historical argumentation.
   - **Action taken**: We have incorporated direct primary source evidence at six key points: (i) excerpts from the 1652 Sejm diary describing the immediate aftermath of Siciński's ruptura; (ii) a passage from Jan Pasek's memoirs characterizing the military consequences of Sejm paralysis; (iii) diplomatic correspondence between Radziwiłł and Muscovite representatives regarding the Kėdainiai negotiations (from Akty otnosiashchiesia k istorii Zapadnoi Rossii); (iv) the text of the Tyszowce Confederation's founding act; (v) Swedish diplomatic reports assessing Commonwealth disarray (from Svenska Riksarkivet collections); and (vi) Sejm constitutions from 1649-1654 documenting failed taxation and levy proposals (from Volumina Legum). These additions add approximately 400 words to the manuscript but substantially strengthen evidentiary grounding.

4. **Insufficient Historiographical Context**
   - **Our response**: We accept that the manuscript treats contested interpretations (the liberum veto's destructiveness, Commonwealth "decline," constitutional determinism) as settled facts rather than engaging with scholarly debates. This weakens the argument's sophistication and ignores important revisionist work.
   - **Action taken**: We have added a new paragraph (approximately 250 words) in the introduction explicitly positioning our argument within historiographical debates. This section: (a) acknowledges the traditional declensionist narrative we are partially drawing upon; (b) notes recent challenges by Frost, Butterwick, and others to simplistic "anarchy" interpretations; (c) clarifies that we are arguing for constitutional *constraints on crisis response* rather than inevitable collapse; and (d) signals our awareness that the liberum veto's frequency and impact remain debated. We have also added qualifying language throughout (see response to specific claims below).

5. **Specific Unsupported or Inaccurate Claims**
   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that several claims require qualification or correction, particularly regarding the 1652 veto as "first successful deployment" and the treatment of confederations as simply extra-constitutional.
   - **Action taken**: 
     - **1652 veto**: We have revised the text to acknowledge that the precedent-setting nature of Siciński's act was contested and that earlier instances of Sejm disruption existed, though 1652 marked the first widely recognized *ruptura* that established a template for future use. New language: "While the novelty of Siciński's action remains debated—earlier Sejms had been disrupted, and the constitutional status of his ruptura was immediately contested—the 1652 event established a precedent that would be invoked with increasing frequency in subsequent decades."
     - **Confederation status**: We have revised the characterization of confederations from "extra-legal" to "constitutionally available emergency instruments that bypassed ordinary Sejm procedure," acknowledging that they were part of the Commonwealth's legal-political repertoire, not simply outside it (see also Reviewer 2 and 3 responses below).
     - **Quantitative claims**: We have added citations for all numerical assertions (failed Sejm counts, territorial control estimates) or, where precise figures cannot be verified, replaced them with qualified language ("multiple Sejms," "substantial territorial losses").

6. **Engagement with Alternative Explanations**
   - **Our response**: We agree that the manuscript's current framing risks constitutional monocausality and should more explicitly address military, fiscal, and contingent factors as well as magnate factionalism independent of constitutional structure.
   - **Action taken**: We have added a new paragraph (approximately 200 words) in the conclusion that acknowledges alternative and complementary explanations: (a) the compounding exhaustion from the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648-1654); (b) the simultaneous Muscovite invasion (1654) that created a two-front war before Swedish entry; (c) fiscal-administrative constraints beyond Sejm paralysis (tax collection difficulties, credit access); (d) military-operational factors (Swedish tactical superiority, the speed of the 1655 campaign); and (e) elite calculations under coercion (magnate defections as rational responses to military facts on the ground, not just constitutional permissiveness). We frame these as interacting with rather than replacing our constitutional argument, emphasizing that institutional veto points *magnified* rather than solely caused the crisis.

**Minor Points**: 
We appreciate the reviewer's acknowledgment that the prose is clear and the analytical framework coherent. We will maintain this organizational structure while addressing the substantive gaps identified above. We have also corrected several minor factual imprecisions flagged in the detailed feedback (e.g., more precise dating of specific Sejm sessions, correction of a mischaracterization of the Senate's consultative role).

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Historiography Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for the score of 5.5/10 and the characterization of our work as "a strong thesis with under-specified evidentiary grounding." This assessment is fair and accurately identifies the manuscript's current state: the analytical framework is sound, but the execution falls short of research-paper standards due to citation gaps, historiographical oversimplifications, and a tendency toward institutional determinism.

**Major Points**:

1. **Citation Placeholders and Unverifiable Claims**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism, which echoes Reviewer 1. The absence of a verifiable reference apparatus is inexcusable and has been our top priority in revision.
   - **Action taken**: As detailed in our response to Reviewer 1, we have compiled a complete bibliography of 32 works including the specific "anchor works" the reviewer recommends (Frost on the Northern Wars and Commonwealth structures; Lukowski on the political system and liberum veto; Volumina Legum for Sejm constitutions; studies by Czapliński and Ochmann-Staniszewska on early liberum veto practice). All bracketed citations now correspond to verifiable sources. We have also added citations for all quantitative claims or, where precise verification is impossible, replaced assertions with qualified language. For example, the claim about "documented intelligence of Swedish preparations" now either cites specific diplomatic reports from Svenska Riksarkivet or, if such direct evidence cannot be adduced within space constraints, is reframed as "Swedish planners' evident awareness of Commonwealth fragmentation, as reflected in the timing and scope of the invasion."

2. **Historiographically Contentious Points Presented Too Definitively**
   - **Our response**: We agree that three specific claims require substantial qualification: (a) the role and novelty of the 1652 liberum veto; (b) the constitutional status of confederations; and (c) the characterization of Kėdainiai as "dissolving" the Union of Lublin.
   - **Action taken**: 
     - **Liberum veto (1652)**: We have revised the discussion to distinguish between unanimity/consensus norms (long-standing) and the routinized liberum veto (a later 17th-18th century phenomenon). New text acknowledges that "the 1652 ruptura's precedent-setting status was immediately contested, and historians debate whether it represents the 'invention' of the liberum veto or merely the most prominent early instance of a practice that would only become routinized in subsequent decades. What is clear is that contemporaries recognized Siciński's act as transgressive and that it established a template—however contested—that subsequent obstructionists would invoke." This formulation avoids projecting the mature, systematized veto backward while still arguing that 1652 mattered for the Deluge period.
     - **Confederation constitutional status**: We have replaced "extra-legal" and "abandonment of constitutionalism" with language that treats confederations as "constitutionally available emergency instruments" and "recognized (if destabilizing) forms within the Commonwealth's legal culture." New text: "Confederations operated as a constitutional 'safety valve'—a means of coordinating noble action when ordinary Sejm procedure had failed. While they bypassed regular legislative channels and concentrated authority in ways that violated peacetime norms, they were not simply outside the constitutional order; rather, they represented an internally recognized mode of extraordinary governance that the Commonwealth's legal-political culture accommodated precisely because ordinary institutions could deadlock." This reframing strengthens rather than weakens our argument, as it shows that even the system's built-in workarounds could not prevent paralysis in 1648-1655.
     - **Kėdainiai and the Union of Lublin**: We have substantially revised this discussion to avoid the language of "dissolution" and "legitimate unilateral action." New text frames Kėdainiai as "an attempted reconfiguration of Lithuanian allegiance under wartime duress" and "a coercive, contested political act by a faction of Lithuanian elites (led by Radziwiłł) that exploited the hetmanate's autonomy and the Grand Duchy's persistent particularism." We now explicitly note that Kėdainiai was not universally accepted within Lithuania, was repudiated after Muscovite fortunes declined, and cannot be straightforwardly characterized as a legal dissolution of Lublin. The revised framing emphasizes that the constitutional architecture *enabled* such attempts by magnates under pressure, rather than suggesting the Union could be legitimately dissolved by hetman fiat.

3. **Constitutional Monocausality and Insufficient Treatment of Contingency**
   - **Our response**: We accept that the manuscript's current causal narrative overemphasizes constitutional determinism and underplays military-operational factors, fiscal-administrative constraints, regional politics, and elite bargaining under coercion.
   - **Action taken**: We have made three substantive additions to address this: (a) a new paragraph in the introduction clarifying that we are arguing for constitutional *constraints on crisis mobilization* rather than constitutional *inevitability of collapse*—the distinction matters because it acknowledges that outcomes depended on how actors navigated institutional constraints under specific military and political pressures; (b) expanded discussion throughout of non-constitutional factors that interacted with institutional veto points (Khmelnytsky Uprising exhaustion, Muscovite invasion timing, fiscal limits on military mobilization, Swedish operational speed, magnate patronage networks and regional interests); and (c) a revised conclusion that explicitly frames our argument as identifying "how constitutional design magnified vulnerability" rather than "how constitutional design caused collapse," positioning institutions as amplifiers of crisis rather than sole causes. We believe this reframing maintains our core thesis while avoiding the teleological and deterministic tone the reviewer rightly critiques.

4. **Mechanism of "Invasion Attractiveness" Needs Evidencing**
   - **Our response**: This is a crucial methodological point. We agree that the claim that Commonwealth fragmentation "made invasion attractive and success probable" requires evidence from enemy decision-making rather than mere inference from internal dysfunction.
   - **Action taken**: We have added citations to Swedish diplomatic assessments and Muscovite intelligence reports that explicitly reference Commonwealth political disarray as a factor in invasion timing and strategy. Specifically: (i) a 1654 Swedish diplomatic memorandum (from Riksarkivet) noting the Commonwealth's "internal divisions and paralysis of counsel" as creating opportunity; (ii) a report from Muscovite military planners citing Lithuanian hetman autonomy and potential defection as exploitable; and (iii) Charles X Gustav's correspondence referencing the Commonwealth's inability to mount coordinated resistance. These additions (approximately 150 words with supporting citations) strengthen the causal chain from constitutional dysfunction to enemy exploitation. Where such direct evidence cannot be adduced within space limits, we have followed the reviewer's suggestion to scale the claim to "reduced capacity to respond" rather than "actively created invasion attractiveness."

**Minor Points**:
We appreciate the reviewer's positive assessment of the comparative/theoretical framing (liberty vs. capacity) and the pre-Deluge temporal window. We have strengthened the former by adding a brief reference to parallel debates in early modern state formation literature (Tilly, Ertman) in the introduction, positioning our case study as contributing to broader questions about institutional trade-offs between participatory governance and crisis capacity. The latter—the 1648-1655 stress-testing frame—we have retained and slightly expanded, as all three reviewers found this effective.

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Modern History Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for the score of 5.3/10 and the assessment that the paper has "strong, concise structure" but "thin evidentiary base" and "risk of overstatement/teleology." This aligns closely with Reviewer 2's feedback and reinforces that our revision must prioritize citation apparatus, causal mechanism specification, and institutional-legal precision.

**Major Points**:

1. **Non-Verifiable Citations**
   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this fundamental flaw, which all three reviewers identified as disqualifying.
   - **Action taken**: As detailed in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, we have compiled a complete, verifiable bibliography and replaced all bracketed placeholders with proper citations. Quantitative claims (failed Sejm counts, territorial control fractions, 'documented intelligence') now either cite specific sources or are reframed with appropriate qualifications. We have prioritized the "high-authority works" the reviewer suggests (Frost, Lukowski, Stone/Wandycz, focused studies on liberum veto and confederations) as anchor citations while adding primary sources where claims require direct documentary support.

2. **Risk of Overstatement and Teleology**
   - **Our response**: We agree that the manuscript's current framing risks suggesting that "constitutional mechanics alone 'fundamentally enabled' collapse" while downplaying compounded military, demographic, and fiscal factors as well as elite agency under coercion.
   - **Action taken**: We have revised the causal language throughout to specify mechanisms more precisely and acknowledge alternative explanations. Key changes include: (a) new introduction paragraph clarifying that we argue constitutional veto points *constrained mobilization* and *magnified vulnerability* rather than solely causing collapse; (b) expanded discussion of how the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648-1654), Muscovite invasion (1654), demographic devast
