      "detailed_feedback": "As an Ancient History specialist, I must reiterate that this manuscript concerns 17th-century early modern European history and falls entirely outside my domain expertise. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569-1795) and the Deluge (1655-1660) postdate the ancient period by more than a millennium. This categorical mismatch should have been corrected before resubmission. That said, the authors have made substantial improvements from Round 1, particularly in providing a verifiable bibliography and incorporating primary source evidence. From a methodological perspective applicable across historical periods, the manuscript now demonstrates basic scholarly competence: it cites real sources, engages with historiography, and qualifies causal claims appropriately. However, significant weaknesses remain. Citation practices still fall short of rigorous historical standards, with many references lacking page numbers or precise attribution. Primary source quotations need verification and more precise documentation. The historiographical engagement, while improved, remains somewhat superficial\u2014the manuscript acknowledges revisionist scholarship but does not deeply engage with specific arguments or demonstrate how its analysis contributes to ongoing debates. The theoretical framework citing Tilly and Ertman is underdeveloped and would benefit from more substantive engagement with their analytical concepts. Most critically, this work requires evaluation by specialists in early modern Polish-Lithuanian history who can assess the accuracy of historical claims, the appropriateness of source interpretations, and the significance of contributions to debates about Commonwealth governance. My assessment should be considered provisional and secondary to such specialist reviews. The manuscript shows promise and has improved substantially, but it needs further refinement before publication and must be redirected to an appropriate disciplinary venue.",

      "summary": "This revision is a substantial improvement over Round 1: it adds a real bibliography, moderates the earlier monocausal tone, and treats the liberum veto, confederations, and K\u0117dainiai with materially better legal-institutional nuance. The core thesis (constitutional veto-points and decentralization as crisis-capacity constraints in 1648\u201355) is now plausible and clearly presented, but several factual/timeline issues and the lack of precise, checkable inline citations still prevent the argument from reaching publication-ready rigor.",

        "Good historiographical positioning for a short paper: the introduction now signals awareness of declensionist vs. revisionist debates (Frost, Lukowski, Butterwick/Grze\u015bkowiak-Krwawicz) and frames the contribution as crisis-governance capacity rather than inevitability-of-collapse."

      "detailed_feedback": "Compared to Round 1, the paper is notably stronger: you have implemented the key requested changes (a real References section, more cautious treatment of 1652 and of confederations, and a shift away from teleological \u2018constitution alone caused collapse\u2019 toward \u2018institutions constrained crisis mobilization\u2019). That said, the revision still needs a final tightening pass on two fronts: (1) verifiability and (2) chronology/institutional precision. On verifiability: although the bibliography is now real and largely appropriate (Frost, Stone, Tilly/Ertman, Czapli\u0144ski), the manuscript still reads as if it is citing in bulk rather than demonstrating claims. Statements such as \u2018Volumina Legum records\u2026failed to achieve passage in 1649, 1651, 1653, and 1654\u2019 require you to identify which Sejm(s), which proposed constitutions (title/topic), and whether the issue was ruptura/dissolution, non-ratification, or partial passage with inadequate enforcement. Similarly, the Swedish \u2018memorandum from the Riksr\u00e5d\u2019 and Muscovite \u2018intelligence reports\u2019 need document-level identifiers (archival series + item) and/or exact quotations; otherwise the argument about enemy exploitation\u2014one of your most important causal bridges\u2014remains vulnerable. On accuracy: the opening\u2019s list of \u201cconcurrent invasions\u201d compresses events in ways specialists will flag (Transylvania\u2019s major campaign is 1657; Brandenburg\u2019s 1655\u201356 role is entangled with Swedish alliance, the Treaty of K\u00f6nigsberg/Marienburg, and shifting overlordship questions rather than a simple invasion). On institutions: you are right to highlight hetman autonomy and the lack of clear subordination, but terms like \u2018standing armies\u2019 and \u2018constitutionally protected private armies\u2019 should be softened to early modern realities (komput/quartz army, confederated troops, pospolite ruszenie; private forces as socially/politically entrenched rather than explicitly guaranteed). Finally, the Tyszowce section is improved by recognizing confederation law as a constitutional repertoire, but its fiscal claims should be qualified: confederations could coordinate, discipline troops, and bind signatories, yet realm-wide taxation and durable public finance still depended on broader legitimacy and later political settlement. With a small number of targeted footnotes, a corrected timeline sentence or two, and one or two concrete micro-cases anchoring your mechanisms, this short paper would move from \u2018strong revision\u2019 to genuinely publication-ready.",

        "Some factual precision and anachronism risk: dating and characterization around K\u0117dainiai (and the pathway to it) and the legislative narrative for 1653\u20131654 need tightening; several secondary works in the bibliography are only weakly relevant to the 1648\u20131655 problem-frame (e.g., Butterwick 1998; Lukowski\u2019s major monograph is eighteenth-century), which undercuts the evidentiary authority of the revisionist framing."

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "Relative to Round 1, the manuscript shows genuine engagement with the review: the historiographical positioning is now explicit and the three previously over-stated points are materially improved (unanimity vs. liberum veto; confederations as a recognized emergency repertoire; K\u0117dainiai as contested wartime realignment rather than a legal dissolution). From a historiographical/critical-method standpoint, the main remaining issue is evidentiary auditability. The paper frequently makes strong empirical assertions (\u201cmultiple Sejms ended in dissolution,\u201d \u201cproposed constitutions failed in 1649/1651/1653/1654,\u201d \u201cdocumented intelligence regarding Swedish preparations,\u201d \u201cMuscovite intelligence reports identified Lithuanian defection potential,\u201d \u201cthe Crown\u2019s budget remained frozen,\u201d \u201cTyszowce imposed extraordinary taxation\u201d) without giving the reader a trail to the underlying record. This is not simply a citation-style quibble: several of these claims require specific genres of evidence (diariusze sejmowe, sejmik instructions/lauda, treasury and military pay registers, or published diplomatic editions) that differ from what your current citations most clearly support. In particular, *Volumina Legum* is excellent for what was enacted, but it cannot, by itself, demonstrate what \u2018failed\u2019\u2014that inference needs procedural sources. Likewise, the Swedish/Muscovite \u2018exploitation\u2019 mechanism is a valuable improvement over the earlier inferential version, but it will only carry historiographical weight if the memo/correspondence is identifiable via call numbers or a standard published edition. Finally, review the event chronology and scope claims: K\u0117dainiai involved multiple instruments in 1655 and is easy to misdate; and strong exclusivity language about the Sejm as the only legitimate channel for emergency action should be softened to reflect the Commonwealth\u2019s plural, negotiated fiscal-administrative practice (commissions, sejmiki implementation, confederate governance). With these targeted fixes\u2014mostly precision and source alignment rather than expansion\u2014the piece would move from a persuasive synthesis to a genuinely robust short research paper.",

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive engagement with our revised manuscript. We are pleased that the reviewers recognize substantial improvements from Round 1, particularly the addition of a verifiable bibliography, incorporation of primary source evidence, more nuanced treatment of constitutional mechanisms, and a shift away from monocausal determinism. The reviewers' consistent feedback identifies clear priorities for the next revision: (1) strengthening citation precision with page numbers and specific document references, (2) correcting chronological and institutional details, (3) deepening historiographical engagement beyond acknowledgment to substantive dialogue, and (4) addressing the fundamental venue mismatch.\n\nWe address below each reviewer's concerns systematically. Most critically, we acknowledge Reviewer 1's essential point that this manuscript belongs in an early modern European history venue, not Ancient History, and commit to resubmission to an appropriate journal. For the substantive historical issues raised by all reviewers, we outline specific revisions that will transform the manuscript from a promising synthesis into a rigorously documented research paper.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Ancient History Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 1's recognition that the manuscript has \"improved substantially\" and now demonstrates \"basic scholarly competence\" with real sources and qualified claims (score: 6.3/10). We fully accept the fundamental criticism that this work is categorically misplaced in an Ancient History venue.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Manuscript outside Ancient History scope**\n   - **Our response**: We agree completely. The 17th-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is early modern history, not ancient history (ending c. 500 CE). This categorical error should have been corrected before Round 2 resubmission, and we apologize for the misdirection.\n   - **Action taken**: We will withdraw this manuscript from the Ancient History venue and resubmit to an appropriate early modern European history journal. Following Reviewer 1's suggestions, we will target *Acta Poloniae Historica*, *Slavonic and East European Review*, or a comparative early modern state formation venue (e.g., *Journal of Early Modern History*) where specialists in Polish-Lithuanian history and early modern state formation can properly evaluate our claims.\n\n2. **Citation density thin; lack of page numbers and precise document references**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism entirely. While Round 2 added a bibliography and some primary source citations, we failed to provide the precision necessary for verification. References like \"Svenska Riksarkivet, Vol. 87\" without page numbers or specific document identifiers are insufficient.\n   - **Action taken**: We will implement a comprehensive citation upgrade:\n     * **Primary sources**: Add page numbers to all Pasek citations (e.g., *Pami\u0119tniki*, ed. Czapli\u0144ski, pp. X-Y); provide specific folio/document numbers for archival references (e.g., \"Svenska Riksarkivet, Diplomatica Polonica, Vol. 87, fol. 234r-235v, memorandum dated 15 August 1655\"); cite specific *Volumina Legum* entries with volume, constitution number, and page (e.g., \"VL IV, const. 12, p. 156\").\n     * **Sejm sessions**: Cite specific diariusze sejmowe entries for each claimed dissolution/rupture (1649, 1651, 1652, 1653, 1654) rather than general references.\n     * **Currently unsupported claims**: Add inline citations for all factual assertions currently lacking attribution (e.g., \"multiple Sejm sessions collapsed\" will cite specific VL entries and diariusz references; \"Swedish diplomatic correspondence\" will provide exact archival identifiers).\n     * **Secondary sources**: Add page numbers to all Frost, Stone, Lukowski, and other citations.\n\n3. **Primary source quotations lack precision; verification difficult**\n   - **Our response**: This is a fair and important criticism. The Pasek quotation and Tyszowce Confederation founding act citations lack the specificity needed for scholarly verification. The concern about \"suspiciously modern\" language in Swedish diplomatic correspondence paraphrases is particularly well-taken.\n   - **Action taken**: \n     * **Pasek quotation**: We will provide the exact page reference from the Czapli\u0144ski edition and clarify that we are working from a modern Polish edition with our own translation to English.\n     * **Tyszowce Confederation**: We will cite the specific document from the published collection (*Akta Konfederacji Tyszowieckiej*, if available in published form) or provide the archival reference with folio numbers.\n     * **Swedish correspondence**: We will verify all quotations against original sources, provide exact document dates and archival references, and clearly distinguish between direct quotations and our translations/paraphrases. If any language proves to be our interpretive summary rather than direct quotation, we will rephrase to make this clear and provide the original language in a footnote.\n     * **Methodological note**: We will add a brief methodological note (as Reviewer 1 suggests) explaining our source selection, translation practices from Latin/Polish/Swedish, and any limitations in accessing primary materials.\n\n4. **Historiographical engagement remains superficial**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that while Round 2 added citations to revisionist scholarship (Frost, Butterwick, Grze\u015bkowiak-Krwawicz), we did not substantively engage with their specific arguments or demonstrate how our analysis differs from or builds upon their work.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand the historiographical discussion to:\n     * **Frost's argument**: Explicitly discuss Frost's emphasis on military-fiscal capacity and his argument that the Commonwealth's decline was not inevitable but contingent on specific military defeats. We will then show how our institutional analysis complements his military-political narrative by demonstrating how constitutional constraints specifically limited crisis mobilization capacity during 1648-1655.\n     * **Butterwick and Grze\u015bkowiak-Krwawicz**: Engage with their revisionist arguments about Commonwealth governance as a functioning republican system with its own rationality. We will clarify that our argument about institutional constraints on crisis response does not imply the system was \"dysfunctional\" in normal times, but rather that its design features created specific vulnerabilities during simultaneous multi-front crises.\n     * **Comparative context**: Demonstrate how our analysis contributes to debates about early modern state formation by showing that the Commonwealth represents an alternative developmental path (decentralized, consensus-based) that had different crisis-response capabilities than centralizing monarchies.\n\n5. **Theoretical framework (Tilly, Ertman) underdeveloped**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that citing Tilly and Ertman without substantive engagement with their analytical frameworks weakens the manuscript's theoretical contribution.\n   - **Action taken**: We will develop the theoretical framework more fully:\n     * **Tilly**: Engage specifically with his argument about war-making driving state-making and extraction capacity. We will show how the Commonwealth case complicates this framework\u2014it faced intense military pressure but its institutional structure prevented the extraction-capacity development that Tilly's model predicts.\n     * **Ertman**: Discuss his typology of state formation pathways and demonstrate where the Commonwealth fits (or doesn't fit) in his framework. We will argue that the Commonwealth represents a path of \"constitutionally constrained extraction\" that Ertman's Western European focus underemphasizes.\n     * **Analytical contribution**: Clarify what the Commonwealth case contributes to state formation theory: it demonstrates that institutional veto-points can prevent crisis-driven state capacity development even under extreme military pressure, challenging assumptions about the inevitability of centralization under warfare pressure.\n\n**Minor Points**: \nWe appreciate Reviewer 1's recognition that our Round 2 revisions successfully addressed the Round 1 concerns about constitutional monocausality and qualification of controversial claims. We will maintain this multi-causal framework while strengthening the evidentiary support for each causal mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Modern History Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 2 for recognizing this as \"a substantial improvement over Round 1\" with a \"plausible and clearly presented\" core thesis (score: 6.8/10). We appreciate the detailed identification of remaining factual, chronological, and citation issues that prevent the manuscript from being \"publication-ready.\"\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation practice too non-specific for high-stakes claims**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The manuscript currently asserts rather than demonstrates key claims because citations lack pinpoint support.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add 15-20 targeted inline footnotes with precise references:\n     * **Sejm collapses**: For each claimed dissolution (1649, 1651, 1652, 1653, 1654), we will cite the specific diariusz entry and/or *Volumina Legum* notation indicating ruptura or failed session. For example, the 1652 ruptura will cite both the contemporary diariusz and the relevant secondary literature (Ochmann-Staniszewska's work on the 1652 Sejm).\n     * ***Volumina Legum* records**: We will specify which proposed constitutions failed by citing Sejm diaries showing proposals that did not result in enacted legislation, and cite specific VL entries for what was enacted but insufficient.\n     * **Swedish memoranda/correspondence**: We will provide complete archival identifiers: \"Svenska Riksarkivet, Riksregistraturet [or Diplomatica Polonica], Vol. X, fol. Y, [official/correspondent] to [recipient], dated [specific date].\" If we are working from published diplomatic editions, we will cite those with page numbers.\n     * **Frost citations**: Add specific page numbers for all chronological and analytical claims drawn from Frost's work.\n\n2. **Timeline and contextual inaccuracies**\n   - **Our response**: We thank Reviewer 2 for catching these important errors. The chronological compressions and oversimplifications undermine the manuscript's credibility.\n   - **Action taken**: We will correct the following:\n     * **Transylvania**: Remove Transylvania from the list of \"concurrent 1655 invaders\" and correctly date R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's major intervention to 1657. We will revise the opening to focus on the Swedish invasion (July 1655) and Muscovite invasion (summer 1654, escalating 1655) as the primary concurrent threats during the 1655 crisis moment.\n     * **Brandenburg-Prussia**: Revise characterization from \"invasion\" to accurately reflect Brandenburg's complex role: initial alliance with Sweden (Treaty of K\u00f6nigsberg, January 1656), shifting to Commonwealth alliance (Treaty of Wehlau, 1657). We will clarify that Brandenburg was not a straightforward invader but a pivotal swing power whose allegiance was contested.\n     * **Sejm legislative record 1649-1654**: Specify which sessions were dissolved/ruptured versus contentious but productive. We will clarify what measures actually passed (e.g., 1649 and 1651 did pass some military funding) and explain why they were insufficient rather than implying total failure. The argument will shift to \"inadequate crisis response\" rather than \"complete legislative paralysis.\"\n\n3. **Institutional claims need tighter legal-historical phrasing**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that our language about \"standing armies,\" \"constitutionally protected private armies,\" and Tyszowce's fiscal authority oversimplifies early modern realities.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise institutional descriptions:\n     * **Hetman forces**: Replace \"standing army\" with more accurate terminology: \"komput army\" (the authorized military establishment), \"quartz army\" (paid from the quarter tax), and distinguish these from pospolite ruszenie (noble levy) and confederated forces. We will clarify that hetmans commanded these forces with substantial operational autonomy but within a framework of theoretical Sejm authorization.\n     * **Magnate private forces**: Revise from \"constitutionally protected\" to \"socially and politically entrenched\" or \"customary and tolerated.\" We will explain that magnates' military retinues were not explicitly guaranteed by constitutional law but were embedded in the noble-republican social order and difficult to regulate without threatening noble liberties.\n     * **Tyszowce fiscal authority**: Qualify the claim about \"imposing extraordinary taxation.\" We will clarify that confederations could coordinate contributions from participants, enforce discipline, and organize military finance within their membership, but that realm-wide, durable fiscal authority still intersected with Sejm practices, treasury administration, and subsequent political ratification. The revised argument will emphasize that Tyszowce created an *alternative* fiscal-military coordination mechanism that bypassed normal Sejm procedures, rather than claiming it had unqualified taxing power.\n\n4. **Need concrete micro-cases for mechanisms**\n   - **Our response**: This is an excellent suggestion that will substantially strengthen the argument's empirical grounding.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add two specific micro-cases:\n     * **Fiscal/legislative mechanism**: Identify one specific tax proposal or military komput decision that was blocked or delayed (e.g., the proposed increase in the quarter tax or specific levy proposals in 1653 or 1654), cite the Sejm diary evidence, and trace the operational consequence (e.g., delayed payment to specific military units, documented in treasury records or military correspondence).\n     * **Diplomatic fragmentation mechanism**: Provide one clearly cited instance of Swedish or Muscovite decision-makers explicitly referencing Commonwealth divided authority. For example, we will locate and cite a specific Swedish Riksr\u00e5d memorandum or diplomatic instruction that references the expectation of Lithuanian separate negotiation or magnate defection, with exact archival reference and quotation in original language with translation.\n\n**Minor Points**: \nWe appreciate Reviewer 2's recognition of our improved structure and historiographical positioning. We will maintain the clear three-domain framework while adding the precision and concrete examples that will make it \"genuinely publication-ready.\"\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Historiography Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 3 for recognizing \"substantial improvement over Round 1\" with \"notably better legal-institutional nuance\" and \"clear structure\" (score: 6.3/10). We appreciate the detailed methodological critique identifying verification problems and source-method mismatches.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Verification remains a problem; closer to essayistic synthesis than checkable research**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this fundamental criticism. The manuscript's evidentiary claims remain difficult to audit because specific page numbers, diary entries, and archival call numbers are missing.\n   - **Action taken**: We will implement the citation infrastructure described in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, with particular attention to Reviewer 3's emphasis on \"checkable\" evidence:\n     * **Sejm claims**: Each assertion about Sejm collapse, dissolution, or failed passage will be tied to specific diariusz entries (with page numbers from published editions or folio numbers from manuscript sources).\n     * **Fiscal claims**: Any statement about \"budget frozen\" or inadequate taxation will be supported by either enacted VL constitutions (showing what was authorized) or treasury records/military pay documentation (showing what was actually collected/disbursed).\n     * **Swedish/Muscovite assessments**: Complete archival identifiers (fond/series/volume/call number) or published edition citations for all diplomatic correspondence, with quotations in original language and our translations.\n     * **Pasek and Frost**: Page numbers for all citations.\n\n2. **Source-method mismatch: *Volumina Legum* cannot show what \"failed\"**\n   - **Our response**: This is an important methodological correction. Reviewer 3 is absolutely right that *Volumina Legum* prints enacted constitutions and therefore cannot, by itself, demonstrate failed proposals or non-enactment.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise our use of *Volumina Legum* in two ways:\n     * **Rephrase claims**: Change statements like \"Volumina Legum records proposals that failed to achieve passage\" to more accurate formulations: \"Volumina Legum shows that enacted taxation measures in [years] remained at [levels], insufficient for the scale of military mobilization required, while Sejm diaries indicate that proposals for increased levies were debated but not enacted.\"\n     * **Add appropriate sources for \"failure\"**: Use Sejm diaries (diariusze sejmowe), sejmik instructions (lauda), and correspondence to document what was proposed but not enacted. For example, we will cite specific diariusz passages showing debate over tax increases that ended in ruptura or non-agreement.\n     * **Narrow claims where necessary**: Where we lack access to diariusze for specific sessions, we will narrow claims to what VL can demonstrate: \"enacted measures were inadequate\" rather than \"proposals failed.\"\n\n3. **Factual precision issues: K\u0117dainiai dating and 1653-1654 legislative narrative**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge the need for greater precision on K\u0117dainiai chronology and the legislative record.\n   - **Action taken**:\n     * **K\u0117dainiai**: We will clarify the sequence and dating of the 1655 K\u0117dainiai agreements, distinguishing the August 1655 preliminary agreements from the October 1655 Union of K\u0117dainiai, and specifying which Lithuanian magnates and officials participated at each stage. We will also clarify the contested nature of these agreements\u2014they represented one faction's wartime realignment, not a unified Lithuanian decision or a clean legal dissolution of the Union of Lublin.\n     * **1653-1654 Sejms**: We will review the legislative record for these sessions and provide accurate characterization of what passed, what failed, and what was deb",
