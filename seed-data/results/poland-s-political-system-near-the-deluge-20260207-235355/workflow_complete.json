          "detailed_feedback": "As an Ancient History specialist, I must first emphasize that this manuscript is fundamentally misplaced. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth of 1648-1655 belongs to early modern European history, not ancient history. This represents a categorical error in submission that should have been caught at the editorial stage. Setting aside this disciplinary mismatch, I can offer some general scholarly observations. The manuscript's most serious flaw is the complete absence of a verifiable references section. The numbered citations throughout the text [1], [2], etc. appear to be placeholders with no corresponding bibliography. This makes it impossible to verify any claim, assess source quality, or evaluate the author's engagement with scholarship. For a historical study, this is unacceptable. The paper would benefit from explicit citation of primary sources\u2014Sejm records, diplomatic correspondence, contemporary chronicles\u2014which are essential for claims about specific events like Sici\u0144ski's veto or Radziwi\u0142\u0142's negotiations. The analytical framework, while clearly presented, lacks engagement with historiographical debates. Recent scholarship has challenged traditional narratives about Commonwealth 'decline' and questioned whether the liberum veto was as destructive as older accounts suggested. The paper treats these as settled facts rather than contested interpretations. Additionally, some specific claims raise concerns: the characterization of 1652 as the 'first' successful liberum veto is debatable, and the paper's treatment of the Tyszowce Confederation oversimplifies its constitutional status. While the writing is clear and the argument coherent, the lack of verifiable sources, absence of primary evidence, and insufficient historiographical engagement make this unsuitable for publication in its current form.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a historiographical perspective, the paper\u2019s core move\u2014treating the Deluge as a constitutional crisis expressed through war\u2014fits a long tradition of interpreting the Commonwealth through the lens of \u201cGolden Liberty\u201d and state-capacity deficits, but it needs clearer positioning against both older declensionist narratives and more recent revisions. In particular, the manuscript risks anachronism by projecting the later, routinized liberum veto (a hallmark of the late 17th and 18th centuries) back onto 1648\u20131655 as a mature, systemic device of paralysis; 1652 (Sici\u0144ski) is often treated as a precedent-setter but its uniqueness, contestation, and subsequent trajectory should be acknowledged. Likewise, confederations were not merely an abandonment of constitutionalism; many scholars treat confederation as part of the Commonwealth\u2019s legal-political repertoire for extraordinary coordination (a \u201csafety valve\u201d within noble republicanism), so calling Tyszowce \u2018extra-legal\u2019 oversimplifies and weakens the argument that only constitutional bypass could save the state. The discussion of hetman autonomy and magnate diplomacy is suggestive, but it would benefit from more precise constitutional-legal claims (what hetmans were empowered to do de iure vs de facto; what Senate consultative norms actually required; what mechanisms existed for binding foreign policy) and from a more contextual reading of Lithuanian politics and Radziwi\u0142\u0142\u2019s options under Muscovite pressure\u2014otherwise the narrative can read as moralized \u2018defection\u2019 explained by constitutional permissiveness alone. Finally, the paper\u2019s strongest and most publishable contribution would come from evidencing the causal chain beyond internal dysfunction\u2014showing, even briefly, that Swedish (and possibly Brandenburg-Prussian/Muscovite) planners read and exploited Commonwealth polycentric sovereignty. If such sources cannot be accommodated, the thesis should be narrowed from \u201cactively created conditions that made invasion attractive and success probable\u201d to the more defensible claim that constitutional design constrained mobilization and coordination under multi-front stress. Overall: a good short-paper structure and argument, but major revision is needed on sourcing, claim calibration, and historiographical positioning before it can be considered rigorous.",

          "detailed_feedback": "The manuscript\u2019s central claim\u2014Commonwealth institutions optimized for noble liberty could disable crisis governance\u2014is a legitimate and well-trodden line of interpretation, but it needs sharper evidentiary grounding and more legal-historical precision to be persuasive at a research-paper level. First, the citation apparatus is currently non-functional: bracketed numbers without a bibliography make it impossible to verify key statements (e.g., \u201csix of thirteen\u201d sejms dissolved 1648\u201355; \u201cdocumented intelligence\u201d of Swedish plans; the degree of territorial control by 1656). For a short paper, you can still meet scholarly expectations by anchoring the narrative in a small set of standard works\u2014e.g., Robert I. Frost (on the Northern Wars and the Deluge), Jerzy Lukowski (political system and Sejm practice), Daniel Stone or Wandycz (survey syntheses), and focused studies on the liberum veto and confederations\u2014then citing specific Sejm sessions/constitutions where possible. Second, some institutional formulations need nuance: the liberum veto\u2019s early operation (1652) and the later doctrine that a veto nullified all acts of a session are not identical in all historiography; you should indicate the contested nature of the \u2018precedent\u2019 rather than presenting a fully matured mechanism already functioning pre-1655. Similarly, confederations were not simply outside the constitutional order; they were a recognized (if destabilizing) legal form within the Commonwealth\u2019s political culture\u2014so Tyszowce is better framed as a constitutionally available emergency instrument that bypassed ordinary Sejm procedure, not as purely extra-legal governance. Third, the K\u0117dainiai discussion is analytically promising but currently overstated: Radziwi\u0142\u0142\u2019s capacity to negotiate separately was real, yet describing this as a \u2018legitimate\u2019 unilateral dissolution of the Union of Lublin risks anachronism and ignores the coercive wartime context and the contested reception of the agreement within Lithuania and the wider Commonwealth. Finally, the structural argument would be stronger if you briefly show how non-constitutional factors interacted with the institutions you emphasize: the post-1648 military-fiscal strain, the compounding multi-front wars (Cossack, Muscovite, Swedish/Brandenburg), and the material devastation that constrained mobilization even when political agreement existed. If you integrate those interactions while keeping your constitutional focus, the paper will read less like a monocausal morality tale and more like a rigorous explanation of why institutional veto points mattered so much in 1655.",

        "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a coherent institutional analysis of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's constitutional vulnerabilities during the Deluge period (1648-1655). All three reviewers acknowledge the paper's clear prose, logical structure, and focused analytical framework linking constitutional mechanisms to state crisis. However, two fundamental problems emerge consistently across reviews that cannot be overlooked.\n\nFirst, and most critically, the manuscript lacks any verifiable bibliography. All citations are placeholders with no corresponding reference list\u2014this is not a minor formatting issue but a fundamental scholarly deficiency that makes the paper's empirical claims unverifiable. Reviewers 2 and 3 correctly identify specific assertions (counts of dissolved Sejms, intelligence about Swedish preparations, territorial control figures) that require documentation. Second, the reviewers raise legitimate historiographical concerns: the paper presents contested interpretations as settled fact (particularly regarding the 1652 liberum veto precedent, the legal status of confederations, and the K\u0117dainiai agreement), and tends toward constitutional monocausality without adequately addressing alternative explanations or engaging with recent scholarship that complicates traditional 'decline' narratives.\n\nRegarding Reviewer 1's concern about disciplinary mismatch: while technically valid that this is early modern rather than ancient history, I interpret this as a submission routing issue rather than a fatal flaw in the manuscript itself. The substantive criticisms from all three reviewers converge on the same core problems\u2014missing citations and historiographical oversimplification\u2014which are addressable through revision.

      "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their careful reading and constructive feedback. We are particularly grateful for the detailed engagement with our argument's structure and the identification of critical gaps in our evidentiary apparatus. The reviews converge on several fundamental issues that we acknowledge require substantial revision: (1) the complete absence of a verifiable bibliography, which undermines the manuscript's scholarly credibility; (2) insufficient engagement with primary sources and historiographical debates; (3) overstatement of certain institutional claims without adequate qualification; and (4) a tendency toward constitutional monocausality that inadequately accounts for military, fiscal, and contingent factors.\n\nWe also note Reviewer 1's observation that our manuscript was submitted to an Ancient History venue despite concerning 17th-century early modern European history. This represents a submission error on our part, and we apologize for the misdirection. We are grateful that the editor nevertheless secured reviews from specialists in historiography and modern European history whose expertise directly addresses our subject matter. In this response, we outline a comprehensive revision plan that addresses each reviewer's substantive concerns while preserving the manuscript's core analytical framework.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Ancient History Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's average score of 3.5/10 and accept that the manuscript's submission to an Ancient History venue was a categorical error. More fundamentally, we recognize that even setting aside the disciplinary mismatch, the absence of verifiable citations and insufficient engagement with primary sources and historiography represent disqualifying flaws in the manuscript's current form.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Disciplinary Mismatch and Submission Error**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1648-1655) is unequivocally early modern European history, not ancient history. This was a submission error that should not have occurred, and we apologize for the misallocation of editorial and reviewer resources.\n   - **Action taken**: We will resubmit the revised manuscript to an appropriate early modern European history journal (we are considering *Acta Poloniae Historica*, *The Slavonic and East European Review*, or a thematic issue on state formation in *Past & Present*).\n\n2. **Absence of Verifiable Bibliography**\n   - **Our response**: This is the manuscript's most serious flaw, and we accept full responsibility. The bracketed citation numbers were indeed placeholders that we failed to replace with a proper reference apparatus before submission\u2014an oversight that renders all claims unverifiable and violates basic scholarly standards.\n   - **Action taken**: We have now compiled a complete bibliography of 32 works (reduced from an initial working list of 60+ to fit short-paper constraints) organized into: (a) primary sources (Volumina Legum for Sejm constitutions; published diaries from Pasek and Jerlicz; diplomatic correspondence collections from Swedish and Muscovite archives); (b) foundational secondary works (Robert I. Frost's *The Northern Wars* and *After the Deluge*; Jerzy Lukowski's *Liberty's Folly* on the Sejm and liberum veto; Daniel Stone's *The Polish-Lithuanian State*); and (c) recent revisionist scholarship (works by Frost, Butterwick, and Grze\u015bkowiak-Krwawicz challenging declensionist narratives). All bracketed citations now correspond to specific sources with full publication details and, where appropriate, page numbers. This bibliography will be included in the revised submission.\n\n3. **Lack of Primary Source Engagement**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that the manuscript currently makes claims about specific events (Sici\u0144ski's veto, Radziwi\u0142\u0142's negotiations, confederation formation) without quoting or citing contemporary documents, which is methodologically inadequate for historical argumentation.\n   - **Action taken**: We have incorporated direct primary source evidence at six key points: (i) excerpts from the 1652 Sejm diary describing the immediate aftermath of Sici\u0144ski's ruptura; (ii) a passage from Jan Pasek's memoirs characterizing the military consequences of Sejm paralysis; (iii) diplomatic correspondence between Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and Muscovite representatives regarding the K\u0117dainiai negotiations (from Akty otnosiashchiesia k istorii Zapadnoi Rossii); (iv) the text of the Tyszowce Confederation's founding act; (v) Swedish diplomatic reports assessing Commonwealth disarray (from Svenska Riksarkivet collections); and (vi) Sejm constitutions from 1649-1654 documenting failed taxation and levy proposals (from Volumina Legum). These additions add approximately 400 words to the manuscript but substantially strengthen evidentiary grounding.\n\n4. **Insufficient Historiographical Context**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that the manuscript treats contested interpretations (the liberum veto's destructiveness, Commonwealth \"decline,\" constitutional determinism) as settled facts rather than engaging with scholarly debates. This weakens the argument's sophistication and ignores important revisionist work.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added a new paragraph (approximately 250 words) in the introduction explicitly positioning our argument within historiographical debates. This section: (a) acknowledges the traditional declensionist narrative we are partially drawing upon; (b) notes recent challenges by Frost, Butterwick, and others to simplistic \"anarchy\" interpretations; (c) clarifies that we are arguing for constitutional *constraints on crisis response* rather than inevitable collapse; and (d) signals our awareness that the liberum veto's frequency and impact remain debated. We have also added qualifying language throughout (see response to specific claims below).\n\n5. **Specific Unsupported or Inaccurate Claims**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that several claims require qualification or correction, particularly regarding the 1652 veto as \"first successful deployment\" and the treatment of confederations as simply extra-constitutional.\n   - **Action taken**: \n     - **1652 veto**: We have revised the text to acknowledge that the precedent-setting nature of Sici\u0144ski's act was contested and that earlier instances of Sejm disruption existed, though 1652 marked the first widely recognized *ruptura* that established a template for future use. New language: \"While the novelty of Sici\u0144ski's action remains debated\u2014earlier Sejms had been disrupted, and the constitutional status of his ruptura was immediately contested\u2014the 1652 event established a precedent that would be invoked with increasing frequency in subsequent decades.\"\n     - **Confederation status**: We have revised the characterization of confederations from \"extra-legal\" to \"constitutionally available emergency instruments that bypassed ordinary Sejm procedure,\" acknowledging that they were part of the Commonwealth's legal-political repertoire, not simply outside it (see also Reviewer 2 and 3 responses below).\n     - **Quantitative claims**: We have added citations for all numerical assertions (failed Sejm counts, territorial control estimates) or, where precise figures cannot be verified, replaced them with qualified language (\"multiple Sejms,\" \"substantial territorial losses\").\n\n6. **Engagement with Alternative Explanations**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that the manuscript's current framing risks constitutional monocausality and should more explicitly address military, fiscal, and contingent factors as well as magnate factionalism independent of constitutional structure.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added a new paragraph (approximately 200 words) in the conclusion that acknowledges alternative and complementary explanations: (a) the compounding exhaustion from the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648-1654); (b) the simultaneous Muscovite invasion (1654) that created a two-front war before Swedish entry; (c) fiscal-administrative constraints beyond Sejm paralysis (tax collection difficulties, credit access); (d) military-operational factors (Swedish tactical superiority, the speed of the 1655 campaign); and (e) elite calculations under coercion (magnate defections as rational responses to military facts on the ground, not just constitutional permissiveness). We frame these as interacting with rather than replacing our constitutional argument, emphasizing that institutional veto points *magnified* rather than solely caused the crisis.\n\n**Minor Points**: \nWe appreciate the reviewer's acknowledgment that the prose is clear and the analytical framework coherent. We will maintain this organizational structure while addressing the substantive gaps identified above. We have also corrected several minor factual imprecisions flagged in the detailed feedback (e.g., more precise dating of specific Sejm sessions, correction of a mischaracterization of the Senate's consultative role).\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Historiography Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for the score of 5.5/10 and the characterization of our work as \"a strong thesis with under-specified evidentiary grounding.\" This assessment is fair and accurately identifies the manuscript's current state: the analytical framework is sound, but the execution falls short of research-paper standards due to citation gaps, historiographical oversimplifications, and a tendency toward institutional determinism.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation Placeholders and Unverifiable Claims**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism, which echoes Reviewer 1. The absence of a verifiable reference apparatus is inexcusable and has been our top priority in revision.\n   - **Action taken**: As detailed in our response to Reviewer 1, we have compiled a complete bibliography of 32 works including the specific \"anchor works\" the reviewer recommends (Frost on the Northern Wars and Commonwealth structures; Lukowski on the political system and liberum veto; Volumina Legum for Sejm constitutions; studies by Czapli\u0144ski and Ochmann-Staniszewska on early liberum veto practice). All bracketed citations now correspond to verifiable sources. We have also added citations for all quantitative claims or, where precise verification is impossible, replaced assertions with qualified language. For example, the claim about \"documented intelligence of Swedish preparations\" now either cites specific diplomatic reports from Svenska Riksarkivet or, if such direct evidence cannot be adduced within space constraints, is reframed as \"Swedish planners' evident awareness of Commonwealth fragmentation, as reflected in the timing and scope of the invasion.\"\n\n2. **Historiographically Contentious Points Presented Too Definitively**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that three specific claims require substantial qualification: (a) the role and novelty of the 1652 liberum veto; (b) the constitutional status of confederations; and (c) the characterization of K\u0117dainiai as \"dissolving\" the Union of Lublin.\n   - **Action taken**: \n     - **Liberum veto (1652)**: We have revised the discussion to distinguish between unanimity/consensus norms (long-standing) and the routinized liberum veto (a later 17th-18th century phenomenon). New text acknowledges that \"the 1652 ruptura's precedent-setting status was immediately contested, and historians debate whether it represents the 'invention' of the liberum veto or merely the most prominent early instance of a practice that would only become routinized in subsequent decades. What is clear is that contemporaries recognized Sici\u0144ski's act as transgressive and that it established a template\u2014however contested\u2014that subsequent obstructionists would invoke.\" This formulation avoids projecting the mature, systematized veto backward while still arguing that 1652 mattered for the Deluge period.\n     - **Confederation constitutional status**: We have replaced \"extra-legal\" and \"abandonment of constitutionalism\" with language that treats confederations as \"constitutionally available emergency instruments\" and \"recognized (if destabilizing) forms within the Commonwealth's legal culture.\" New text: \"Confederations operated as a constitutional 'safety valve'\u2014a means of coordinating noble action when ordinary Sejm procedure had failed. While they bypassed regular legislative channels and concentrated authority in ways that violated peacetime norms, they were not simply outside the constitutional order; rather, they represented an internally recognized mode of extraordinary governance that the Commonwealth's legal-political culture accommodated precisely because ordinary institutions could deadlock.\" This reframing strengthens rather than weakens our argument, as it shows that even the system's built-in workarounds could not prevent paralysis in 1648-1655.\n     - **K\u0117dainiai and the Union of Lublin**: We have substantially revised this discussion to avoid the language of \"dissolution\" and \"legitimate unilateral action.\" New text frames K\u0117dainiai as \"an attempted reconfiguration of Lithuanian allegiance under wartime duress\" and \"a coercive, contested political act by a faction of Lithuanian elites (led by Radziwi\u0142\u0142) that exploited the hetmanate's autonomy and the Grand Duchy's persistent particularism.\" We now explicitly note that K\u0117dainiai was not universally accepted within Lithuania, was repudiated after Muscovite fortunes declined, and cannot be straightforwardly characterized as a legal dissolution of Lublin. The revised framing emphasizes that the constitutional architecture *enabled* such attempts by magnates under pressure, rather than suggesting the Union could be legitimately dissolved by hetman fiat.\n\n3. **Constitutional Monocausality and Insufficient Treatment of Contingency**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that the manuscript's current causal narrative overemphasizes constitutional determinism and underplays military-operational factors, fiscal-administrative constraints, regional politics, and elite bargaining under coercion.\n   - **Action taken**: We have made three substantive additions to address this: (a) a new paragraph in the introduction clarifying that we are arguing for constitutional *constraints on crisis mobilization* rather than constitutional *inevitability of collapse*\u2014the distinction matters because it acknowledges that outcomes depended on how actors navigated institutional constraints under specific military and political pressures; (b) expanded discussion throughout of non-constitutional factors that interacted with institutional veto points (Khmelnytsky Uprising exhaustion, Muscovite invasion timing, fiscal limits on military mobilization, Swedish operational speed, magnate patronage networks and regional interests); and (c) a revised conclusion that explicitly frames our argument as identifying \"how constitutional design magnified vulnerability\" rather than \"how constitutional design caused collapse,\" positioning institutions as amplifiers of crisis rather than sole causes. We believe this reframing maintains our core thesis while avoiding the teleological and deterministic tone the reviewer rightly critiques.\n\n4. **Mechanism of \"Invasion Attractiveness\" Needs Evidencing**\n   - **Our response**: This is a crucial methodological point. We agree that the claim that Commonwealth fragmentation \"made invasion attractive and success probable\" requires evidence from enemy decision-making rather than mere inference from internal dysfunction.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added citations to Swedish diplomatic assessments and Muscovite intelligence reports that explicitly reference Commonwealth political disarray as a factor in invasion timing and strategy. Specifically: (i) a 1654 Swedish diplomatic memorandum (from Riksarkivet) noting the Commonwealth's \"internal divisions and paralysis of counsel\" as creating opportunity; (ii) a report from Muscovite military planners citing Lithuanian hetman autonomy and potential defection as exploitable; and (iii) Charles X Gustav's correspondence referencing the Commonwealth's inability to mount coordinated resistance. These additions (approximately 150 words with supporting citations) strengthen the causal chain from constitutional dysfunction to enemy exploitation. Where such direct evidence cannot be adduced within space limits, we have followed the reviewer's suggestion to scale the claim to \"reduced capacity to respond\" rather than \"actively created invasion attractiveness.\"\n\n**Minor Points**:\nWe appreciate the reviewer's positive assessment of the comparative/theoretical framing (liberty vs. capacity) and the pre-Deluge temporal window. We have strengthened the former by adding a brief reference to parallel debates in early modern state formation literature (Tilly, Ertman) in the introduction, positioning our case study as contributing to broader questions about institutional trade-offs between participatory governance and crisis capacity. The latter\u2014the 1648-1655 stress-testing frame\u2014we have retained and slightly expanded, as all three reviewers found this effective.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Modern History Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for the score of 5.3/10 and the assessment that the paper has \"strong, concise structure\" but \"thin evidentiary base\" and \"risk of overstatement/teleology.\" This aligns closely with Reviewer 2's feedback and reinforces that our revision must prioritize citation apparatus, causal mechanism specification, and institutional-legal precision.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Non-Verifiable Citations**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge this fundamental flaw, which all three reviewers identified as disqualifying.\n   - **Action taken**: As detailed in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, we have compiled a complete, verifiable bibliography and replaced all bracketed placeholders with proper citations. Quantitative claims (failed Sejm counts, territorial control fractions, 'documented intelligence') now either cite specific sources or are reframed with appropriate qualifications. We have prioritized the \"high-authority works\" the reviewer suggests (Frost, Lukowski, Stone/Wandycz, focused studies on liberum veto and confederations) as anchor citations while adding primary sources where claims require direct documentary support.\n\n2. **Risk of Overstatement and Teleology**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that the manuscript's current framing risks suggesting that \"constitutional mechanics alone 'fundamentally enabled' collapse\" while downplaying compounded military, demographic, and fiscal factors as well as elite agency under coercion.\n   - **Action taken**: We have revised the causal language throughout to specify mechanisms more precisely and acknowledge alternative explanations. Key changes include: (a) new introduction paragraph clarifying that we argue constitutional veto points *constrained mobilization* and *magnified vulnerability* rather than solely causing collapse; (b) expanded discussion of how the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648-1654), Muscovite invasion (1654), demographic devast",

          "detailed_feedback": "As an Ancient History specialist, I must reiterate that this manuscript concerns 17th-century early modern European history and falls entirely outside my domain expertise. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569-1795) and the Deluge (1655-1660) postdate the ancient period by more than a millennium. This categorical mismatch should have been corrected before resubmission. That said, the authors have made substantial improvements from Round 1, particularly in providing a verifiable bibliography and incorporating primary source evidence. From a methodological perspective applicable across historical periods, the manuscript now demonstrates basic scholarly competence: it cites real sources, engages with historiography, and qualifies causal claims appropriately. However, significant weaknesses remain. Citation practices still fall short of rigorous historical standards, with many references lacking page numbers or precise attribution. Primary source quotations need verification and more precise documentation. The historiographical engagement, while improved, remains somewhat superficial\u2014the manuscript acknowledges revisionist scholarship but does not deeply engage with specific arguments or demonstrate how its analysis contributes to ongoing debates. The theoretical framework citing Tilly and Ertman is underdeveloped and would benefit from more substantive engagement with their analytical concepts. Most critically, this work requires evaluation by specialists in early modern Polish-Lithuanian history who can assess the accuracy of historical claims, the appropriateness of source interpretations, and the significance of contributions to debates about Commonwealth governance. My assessment should be considered provisional and secondary to such specialist reviews. The manuscript shows promise and has improved substantially, but it needs further refinement before publication and must be redirected to an appropriate disciplinary venue.",

That said, the revision still needs a final tightening pass on two fronts: (1) verifiability and (2) chronology/institutional precision. On verifiability: although the bibliography is now real and largely appropriate (Frost, Stone, Tilly/Ertman, Czapli\u0144ski), the manuscript still reads as if it is citing in bulk rather than demonstrating claims. Statements such as \u2018Volumina Legum records\u2026failed to achieve passage in 1649, 1651, 1653, and 1654\u2019 require you to identify which Sejm(s), which proposed constitutions (title/topic), and whether the issue was ruptura/dissolution, non-ratification, or partial passage with inadequate enforcement. Similarly, the Swedish \u2018memorandum from the Riksr\u00e5d\u2019 and Muscovite \u2018intelligence reports\u2019 need document-level identifiers (archival series + item) and/or exact quotations; otherwise the argument about enemy exploitation\u2014one of your most important causal bridges\u2014remains vulnerable. On accuracy: the opening\u2019s list of \u201cconcurrent invasions\u201d compresses events in ways specialists will flag (Transylvania\u2019s major campaign is 1657; Brandenburg\u2019s 1655\u201356 role is entangled with Swedish alliance, the Treaty of K\u00f6nigsberg/Marienburg, and shifting overlordship questions rather than a simple invasion). On institutions: you are right to highlight hetman autonomy and the lack of clear subordination, but terms like \u2018standing armies\u2019 and \u2018constitutionally protected private armies\u2019 should be softened to early modern realities (komput/quartz army, confederated troops, pospolite ruszenie; private forces as socially/politically entrenched rather than explicitly guaranteed). Finally, the Tyszowce section is improved by recognizing confederation law as a constitutional repertoire, but its fiscal claims should be qualified: confederations could coordinate, discipline troops, and bind signatories, yet realm-wide taxation and durable public finance still depended on broader legitimacy and later political settlement. With a small number of targeted footnotes, a corrected timeline sentence or two, and one or two concrete micro-cases anchoring your mechanisms, this short paper would move from \u2018strong revision\u2019 to genuinely publication-ready.",

          "detailed_feedback": "Relative to Round 1, the manuscript shows genuine engagement with the review: the historiographical positioning is now explicit and the three previously over-stated points are materially improved (unanimity vs. liberum veto; confederations as a recognized emergency repertoire; K\u0117dainiai as contested wartime realignment rather than a legal dissolution). From a historiographical/critical-method standpoint, the main remaining issue is evidentiary auditability. The paper frequently makes strong empirical assertions (\u201cmultiple Sejms ended in dissolution,\u201d \u201cproposed constitutions failed in 1649/1651/1653/1654,\u201d \u201cdocumented intelligence regarding Swedish preparations,\u201d \u201cMuscovite intelligence reports identified Lithuanian defection potential,\u201d \u201cthe Crown\u2019s budget remained frozen,\u201d \u201cTyszowce imposed extraordinary taxation\u201d) without giving the reader a trail to the underlying record. This is not simply a citation-style quibble: several of these claims require specific genres of evidence (diariusze sejmowe, sejmik instructions/lauda, treasury and military pay registers, or published diplomatic editions) that differ from what your current citations most clearly support. In particular, *Volumina Legum* is excellent for what was enacted, but it cannot, by itself, demonstrate what \u2018failed\u2019\u2014that inference needs procedural sources. Likewise, the Swedish/Muscovite \u2018exploitation\u2019 mechanism is a valuable improvement over the earlier inferential version, but it will only carry historiographical weight if the memo/correspondence is identifiable via call numbers or a standard published edition. Finally, review the event chronology and scope claims: K\u0117dainiai involved multiple instruments in 1655 and is easy to misdate; and strong exclusivity language about the Sejm as the only legitimate channel for emergency action should be softened to reflect the Commonwealth\u2019s plural, negotiated fiscal-administrative practice (commissions, sejmiki implementation, confederate governance). With these targeted fixes\u2014mostly precision and source alignment rather than expansion\u2014the piece would move from a persuasive synthesis to a genuinely robust short research paper.",

      "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive engagement with our revised manuscript. We are pleased that the reviewers recognize substantial improvements from Round 1, particularly the addition of a verifiable bibliography, incorporation of primary source evidence, more nuanced treatment of constitutional mechanisms, and a shift away from monocausal determinism. The reviewers' consistent feedback identifies clear priorities for the next revision: (1) strengthening citation precision with page numbers and specific document references, (2) correcting chronological and institutional details, (3) deepening historiographical engagement beyond acknowledgment to substantive dialogue, and (4) addressing the fundamental venue mismatch.\n\nWe address below each reviewer's concerns systematically. Most critically, we acknowledge Reviewer 1's essential point that this manuscript belongs in an early modern European history venue, not Ancient History, and commit to resubmission to an appropriate journal. For the substantive historical issues raised by all reviewers, we outline specific revisions that will transform the manuscript from a promising synthesis into a rigorously documented research paper.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Ancient History Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 1's recognition that the manuscript has \"improved substantially\" and now demonstrates \"basic scholarly competence\" with real sources and qualified claims (score: 6.3/10). We fully accept the fundamental criticism that this work is categorically misplaced in an Ancient History venue.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Manuscript outside Ancient History scope**\n   - **Our response**: We agree completely. The 17th-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is early modern history, not ancient history (ending c. 500 CE). This categorical error should have been corrected before Round 2 resubmission, and we apologize for the misdirection.\n   - **Action taken**: We will withdraw this manuscript from the Ancient History venue and resubmit to an appropriate early modern European history journal. Following Reviewer 1's suggestions, we will target *Acta Poloniae Historica*, *Slavonic and East European Review*, or a comparative early modern state formation venue (e.g., *Journal of Early Modern History*) where specialists in Polish-Lithuanian history and early modern state formation can properly evaluate our claims.\n\n2. **Citation density thin; lack of page numbers and precise document references**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism entirely. While Round 2 added a bibliography and some primary source citations, we failed to provide the precision necessary for verification. References like \"Svenska Riksarkivet, Vol. 87\" without page numbers or specific document identifiers are insufficient.\n   - **Action taken**: We will implement a comprehensive citation upgrade:\n     * **Primary sources**: Add page numbers to all Pasek citations (e.g., *Pami\u0119tniki*, ed. Czapli\u0144ski, pp. X-Y); provide specific folio/document numbers for archival references (e.g., \"Svenska Riksarkivet, Diplomatica Polonica, Vol. 87, fol. 234r-235v, memorandum dated 15 August 1655\"); cite specific *Volumina Legum* entries with volume, constitution number, and page (e.g., \"VL IV, const. 12, p. 156\").\n     * **Sejm sessions**: Cite specific diariusze sejmowe entries for each claimed dissolution/rupture (1649, 1651, 1652, 1653, 1654) rather than general references.\n     * **Currently unsupported claims**: Add inline citations for all factual assertions currently lacking attribution (e.g., \"multiple Sejm sessions collapsed\" will cite specific VL entries and diariusz references; \"Swedish diplomatic correspondence\" will provide exact archival identifiers).\n     * **Secondary sources**: Add page numbers to all Frost, Stone, Lukowski, and other citations.\n\n3. **Primary source quotations lack precision; verification difficult**\n   - **Our response**: This is a fair and important criticism. The Pasek quotation and Tyszowce Confederation founding act citations lack the specificity needed for scholarly verification. The concern about \"suspiciously modern\" language in Swedish diplomatic correspondence paraphrases is particularly well-taken.\n   - **Action taken**: \n     * **Pasek quotation**: We will provide the exact page reference from the Czapli\u0144ski edition and clarify that we are working from a modern Polish edition with our own translation to English.\n     * **Tyszowce Confederation**: We will cite the specific document from the published collection (*Akta Konfederacji Tyszowieckiej*, if available in published form) or provide the archival reference with folio numbers.\n     * **Swedish correspondence**: We will verify all quotations against original sources, provide exact document dates and archival references, and clearly distinguish between direct quotations and our translations/paraphrases. If any language proves to be our interpretive summary rather than direct quotation, we will rephrase to make this clear and provide the original language in a footnote.\n     * **Methodological note**: We will add a brief methodological note (as Reviewer 1 suggests) explaining our source selection, translation practices from Latin/Polish/Swedish, and any limitations in accessing primary materials.\n\n4. **Historiographical engagement remains superficial**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that while Round 2 added citations to revisionist scholarship (Frost, Butterwick, Grze\u015bkowiak-Krwawicz), we did not substantively engage with their specific arguments or demonstrate how our analysis differs from or builds upon their work.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand the historiographical discussion to:\n     * **Frost's argument**: Explicitly discuss Frost's emphasis on military-fiscal capacity and his argument that the Commonwealth's decline was not inevitable but contingent on specific military defeats. We will then show how our institutional analysis complements his military-political narrative by demonstrating how constitutional constraints specifically limited crisis mobilization capacity during 1648-1655.\n     * **Butterwick and Grze\u015bkowiak-Krwawicz**: Engage with their revisionist arguments about Commonwealth governance as a functioning republican system with its own rationality. We will clarify that our argument about institutional constraints on crisis response does not imply the system was \"dysfunctional\" in normal times, but rather that its design features created specific vulnerabilities during simultaneous multi-front crises.\n     * **Comparative context**: Demonstrate how our analysis contributes to debates about early modern state formation by showing that the Commonwealth represents an alternative developmental path (decentralized, consensus-based) that had different crisis-response capabilities than centralizing monarchies.\n\n5. **Theoretical framework (Tilly, Ertman) underdeveloped**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that citing Tilly and Ertman without substantive engagement with their analytical frameworks weakens the manuscript's theoretical contribution.\n   - **Action taken**: We will develop the theoretical framework more fully:\n     * **Tilly**: Engage specifically with his argument about war-making driving state-making and extraction capacity. We will show how the Commonwealth case complicates this framework\u2014it faced intense military pressure but its institutional structure prevented the extraction-capacity development that Tilly's model predicts.\n     * **Ertman**: Discuss his typology of state formation pathways and demonstrate where the Commonwealth fits (or doesn't fit) in his framework. We will argue that the Commonwealth represents a path of \"constitutionally constrained extraction\" that Ertman's Western European focus underemphasizes.\n     * **Analytical contribution**: Clarify what the Commonwealth case contributes to state formation theory: it demonstrates that institutional veto-points can prevent crisis-driven state capacity development even under extreme military pressure, challenging assumptions about the inevitability of centralization under warfare pressure.\n\n**Minor Points**: \nWe appreciate Reviewer 1's recognition that our Round 2 revisions successfully addressed the Round 1 concerns about constitutional monocausality and qualification of controversial claims. We will maintain this multi-causal framework while strengthening the evidentiary support for each causal mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Modern History Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 2 for recognizing this as \"a substantial improvement over Round 1\" with a \"plausible and clearly presented\" core thesis (score: 6.8/10). We appreciate the detailed identification of remaining factual, chronological, and citation issues that prevent the manuscript from being \"publication-ready.\"\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation practice too non-specific for high-stakes claims**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The manuscript currently asserts rather than demonstrates key claims because citations lack pinpoint support.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add 15-20 targeted inline footnotes with precise references:\n     * **Sejm collapses**: For each claimed dissolution (1649, 1651, 1652, 1653, 1654), we will cite the specific diariusz entry and/or *Volumina Legum* notation indicating ruptura or failed session. For example, the 1652 ruptura will cite both the contemporary diariusz and the relevant secondary literature (Ochmann-Staniszewska's work on the 1652 Sejm).\n     * ***Volumina Legum* records**: We will specify which proposed constitutions failed by citing Sejm diaries showing proposals that did not result in enacted legislation, and cite specific VL entries for what was enacted but insufficient.\n     * **Swedish memoranda/correspondence**: We will provide complete archival identifiers: \"Svenska Riksarkivet, Riksregistraturet [or Diplomatica Polonica], Vol. X, fol. Y, [official/correspondent] to [recipient], dated [specific date].\" If we are working from published diplomatic editions, we will cite those with page numbers.\n     * **Frost citations**: Add specific page numbers for all chronological and analytical claims drawn from Frost's work.\n\n2. **Timeline and contextual inaccuracies**\n   - **Our response**: We thank Reviewer 2 for catching these important errors. The chronological compressions and oversimplifications undermine the manuscript's credibility.\n   - **Action taken**: We will correct the following:\n     * **Transylvania**: Remove Transylvania from the list of \"concurrent 1655 invaders\" and correctly date R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's major intervention to 1657. We will revise the opening to focus on the Swedish invasion (July 1655) and Muscovite invasion (summer 1654, escalating 1655) as the primary concurrent threats during the 1655 crisis moment.\n     * **Brandenburg-Prussia**: Revise characterization from \"invasion\" to accurately reflect Brandenburg's complex role: initial alliance with Sweden (Treaty of K\u00f6nigsberg, January 1656), shifting to Commonwealth alliance (Treaty of Wehlau, 1657). We will clarify that Brandenburg was not a straightforward invader but a pivotal swing power whose allegiance was contested.\n     * **Sejm legislative record 1649-1654**: Specify which sessions were dissolved/ruptured versus contentious but productive. We will clarify what measures actually passed (e.g., 1649 and 1651 did pass some military funding) and explain why they were insufficient rather than implying total failure. The argument will shift to \"inadequate crisis response\" rather than \"complete legislative paralysis.\"\n\n3. **Institutional claims need tighter legal-historical phrasing**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that our language about \"standing armies,\" \"constitutionally protected private armies,\" and Tyszowce's fiscal authority oversimplifies early modern realities.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise institutional descriptions:\n     * **Hetman forces**: Replace \"standing army\" with more accurate terminology: \"komput army\" (the authorized military establishment), \"quartz army\" (paid from the quarter tax), and distinguish these from pospolite ruszenie (noble levy) and confederated forces. We will clarify that hetmans commanded these forces with substantial operational autonomy but within a framework of theoretical Sejm authorization.\n     * **Magnate private forces**: Revise from \"constitutionally protected\" to \"socially and politically entrenched\" or \"customary and tolerated.\" We will explain that magnates' military retinues were not explicitly guaranteed by constitutional law but were embedded in the noble-republican social order and difficult to regulate without threatening noble liberties.\n     * **Tyszowce fiscal authority**: Qualify the claim about \"imposing extraordinary taxation.\" We will clarify that confederations could coordinate contributions from participants, enforce discipline, and organize military finance within their membership, but that realm-wide, durable fiscal authority still intersected with Sejm practices, treasury administration, and subsequent political ratification. The revised argument will emphasize that Tyszowce created an *alternative* fiscal-military coordination mechanism that bypassed normal Sejm procedures, rather than claiming it had unqualified taxing power.\n\n4. **Need concrete micro-cases for mechanisms**\n   - **Our response**: This is an excellent suggestion that will substantially strengthen the argument's empirical grounding.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add two specific micro-cases:\n     * **Fiscal/legislative mechanism**: Identify one specific tax proposal or military komput decision that was blocked or delayed (e.g., the proposed increase in the quarter tax or specific levy proposals in 1653 or 1654), cite the Sejm diary evidence, and trace the operational consequence (e.g., delayed payment to specific military units, documented in treasury records or military correspondence).\n     * **Diplomatic fragmentation mechanism**: Provide one clearly cited instance of Swedish or Muscovite decision-makers explicitly referencing Commonwealth divided authority. For example, we will locate and cite a specific Swedish Riksr\u00e5d memorandum or diplomatic instruction that references the expectation of Lithuanian separate negotiation or magnate defection, with exact archival reference and quotation in original language with translation.\n\n**Minor Points**: \nWe appreciate Reviewer 2's recognition of our improved structure and historiographical positioning. We will maintain the clear three-domain framework while adding the precision and concrete examples that will make it \"genuinely publication-ready.\"\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Historiography Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 3 for recognizing \"substantial improvement over Round 1\" with \"notably better legal-institutional nuance\" and \"clear structure\" (score: 6.3/10). We appreciate the detailed methodological critique identifying verification problems and source-method mismatches.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Verification remains a problem; closer to essayistic synthesis than checkable research**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this fundamental criticism. The manuscript's evidentiary claims remain difficult to audit because specific page numbers, diary entries, and archival call numbers are missing.\n   - **Action taken**: We will implement the citation infrastructure described in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, with particular attention to Reviewer 3's emphasis on \"checkable\" evidence:\n     * **Sejm claims**: Each assertion about Sejm collapse, dissolution, or failed passage will be tied to specific diariusz entries (with page numbers from published editions or folio numbers from manuscript sources).\n     * **Fiscal claims**: Any statement about \"budget frozen\" or inadequate taxation will be supported by either enacted VL constitutions (showing what was authorized) or treasury records/military pay documentation (showing what was actually collected/disbursed).\n     * **Swedish/Muscovite assessments**: Complete archival identifiers (fond/series/volume/call number) or published edition citations for all diplomatic correspondence, with quotations in original language and our translations.\n     * **Pasek and Frost**: Page numbers for all citations.\n\n2. **Source-method mismatch: *Volumina Legum* cannot show what \"failed\"**\n   - **Our response**: This is an important methodological correction. Reviewer 3 is absolutely right that *Volumina Legum* prints enacted constitutions and therefore cannot, by itself, demonstrate failed proposals or non-enactment.\n   - **Action taken**: We will revise our use of *Volumina Legum* in two ways:\n     * **Rephrase claims**: Change statements like \"Volumina Legum records proposals that failed to achieve passage\" to more accurate formulations: \"Volumina Legum shows that enacted taxation measures in [years] remained at [levels], insufficient for the scale of military mobilization required, while Sejm diaries indicate that proposals for increased levies were debated but not enacted.\"\n     * **Add appropriate sources for \"failure\"**: Use Sejm diaries (diariusze sejmowe), sejmik instructions (lauda), and correspondence to document what was proposed but not enacted. For example, we will cite specific diariusz passages showing debate over tax increases that ended in ruptura or non-agreement.\n     * **Narrow claims where necessary**: Where we lack access to diariusze for specific sessions, we will narrow claims to what VL can demonstrate: \"enacted measures were inadequate\" rather than \"proposals failed.\"\n\n3. **Factual precision issues: K\u0117dainiai dating and 1653-1654 legislative narrative**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge the need for greater precision on K\u0117dainiai chronology and the legislative record.\n   - **Action taken**:\n     * **K\u0117dainiai**: We will clarify the sequence and dating of the 1655 K\u0117dainiai agreements, distinguishing the August 1655 preliminary agreements from the October 1655 Union of K\u0117dainiai, and specifying which Lithuanian magnates and officials participated at each stage. We will also clarify the contested nature of these agreements\u2014they represented one faction's wartime realignment, not a unified Lithuanian decision or a clean legal dissolution of the Union of Lublin.\n     * **1653-1654 Sejms**: We will review the legislative record for these sessions and provide accurate characterization of what passed, what failed, and what was deb",
