## Author Response - Round 2

### Overview

We thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive engagement with our revised manuscript. We are pleased that the reviewers recognize substantial improvements from Round 1, particularly the addition of a verifiable bibliography, incorporation of primary source evidence, more nuanced treatment of constitutional mechanisms, and a shift away from monocausal determinism. The reviewers' consistent feedback identifies clear priorities for the next revision: (1) strengthening citation precision with page numbers and specific document references, (2) correcting chronological and institutional details, (3) deepening historiographical engagement beyond acknowledgment to substantive dialogue, and (4) addressing the fundamental venue mismatch.

We address below each reviewer's concerns systematically. Most critically, we acknowledge Reviewer 1's essential point that this manuscript belongs in an early modern European history venue, not Ancient History, and commit to resubmission to an appropriate journal. For the substantive historical issues raised by all reviewers, we outline specific revisions that will transform the manuscript from a promising synthesis into a rigorously documented research paper.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Ancient History Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate Reviewer 1's recognition that the manuscript has "improved substantially" and now demonstrates "basic scholarly competence" with real sources and qualified claims (score: 6.3/10). We fully accept the fundamental criticism that this work is categorically misplaced in an Ancient History venue.

**Major Points**:

1. **CRITICAL: Manuscript outside Ancient History scope**
   - **Our response**: We agree completely. The 17th-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is early modern history, not ancient history (ending c. 500 CE). This categorical error should have been corrected before Round 2 resubmission, and we apologize for the misdirection.
   - **Action taken**: We will withdraw this manuscript from the Ancient History venue and resubmit to an appropriate early modern European history journal. Following Reviewer 1's suggestions, we will target *Acta Poloniae Historica*, *Slavonic and East European Review*, or a comparative early modern state formation venue (e.g., *Journal of Early Modern History*) where specialists in Polish-Lithuanian history and early modern state formation can properly evaluate our claims.

2. **Citation density thin; lack of page numbers and precise document references**
   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism entirely. While Round 2 added a bibliography and some primary source citations, we failed to provide the precision necessary for verification. References like "Svenska Riksarkivet, Vol. 87" without page numbers or specific document identifiers are insufficient.
   - **Action taken**: We will implement a comprehensive citation upgrade:
     * **Primary sources**: Add page numbers to all Pasek citations (e.g., *Pamiętniki*, ed. Czapliński, pp. X-Y); provide specific folio/document numbers for archival references (e.g., "Svenska Riksarkivet, Diplomatica Polonica, Vol. 87, fol. 234r-235v, memorandum dated 15 August 1655"); cite specific *Volumina Legum* entries with volume, constitution number, and page (e.g., "VL IV, const. 12, p. 156").
     * **Sejm sessions**: Cite specific diariusze sejmowe entries for each claimed dissolution/rupture (1649, 1651, 1652, 1653, 1654) rather than general references.
     * **Currently unsupported claims**: Add inline citations for all factual assertions currently lacking attribution (e.g., "multiple Sejm sessions collapsed" will cite specific VL entries and diariusz references; "Swedish diplomatic correspondence" will provide exact archival identifiers).
     * **Secondary sources**: Add page numbers to all Frost, Stone, Lukowski, and other citations.

3. **Primary source quotations lack precision; verification difficult**
   - **Our response**: This is a fair and important criticism. The Pasek quotation and Tyszowce Confederation founding act citations lack the specificity needed for scholarly verification. The concern about "suspiciously modern" language in Swedish diplomatic correspondence paraphrases is particularly well-taken.
   - **Action taken**: 
     * **Pasek quotation**: We will provide the exact page reference from the Czapliński edition and clarify that we are working from a modern Polish edition with our own translation to English.
     * **Tyszowce Confederation**: We will cite the specific document from the published collection (*Akta Konfederacji Tyszowieckiej*, if available in published form) or provide the archival reference with folio numbers.
     * **Swedish correspondence**: We will verify all quotations against original sources, provide exact document dates and archival references, and clearly distinguish between direct quotations and our translations/paraphrases. If any language proves to be our interpretive summary rather than direct quotation, we will rephrase to make this clear and provide the original language in a footnote.
     * **Methodological note**: We will add a brief methodological note (as Reviewer 1 suggests) explaining our source selection, translation practices from Latin/Polish/Swedish, and any limitations in accessing primary materials.

4. **Historiographical engagement remains superficial**
   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that while Round 2 added citations to revisionist scholarship (Frost, Butterwick, Grześkowiak-Krwawicz), we did not substantively engage with their specific arguments or demonstrate how our analysis differs from or builds upon their work.
   - **Action taken**: We will expand the historiographical discussion to:
     * **Frost's argument**: Explicitly discuss Frost's emphasis on military-fiscal capacity and his argument that the Commonwealth's decline was not inevitable but contingent on specific military defeats. We will then show how our institutional analysis complements his military-political narrative by demonstrating how constitutional constraints specifically limited crisis mobilization capacity during 1648-1655.
     * **Butterwick and Grześkowiak-Krwawicz**: Engage with their revisionist arguments about Commonwealth governance as a functioning republican system with its own rationality. We will clarify that our argument about institutional constraints on crisis response does not imply the system was "dysfunctional" in normal times, but rather that its design features created specific vulnerabilities during simultaneous multi-front crises.
     * **Comparative context**: Demonstrate how our analysis contributes to debates about early modern state formation by showing that the Commonwealth represents an alternative developmental path (decentralized, consensus-based) that had different crisis-response capabilities than centralizing monarchies.

5. **Theoretical framework (Tilly, Ertman) underdeveloped**
   - **Our response**: We agree that citing Tilly and Ertman without substantive engagement with their analytical frameworks weakens the manuscript's theoretical contribution.
   - **Action taken**: We will develop the theoretical framework more fully:
     * **Tilly**: Engage specifically with his argument about war-making driving state-making and extraction capacity. We will show how the Commonwealth case complicates this framework—it faced intense military pressure but its institutional structure prevented the extraction-capacity development that Tilly's model predicts.
     * **Ertman**: Discuss his typology of state formation pathways and demonstrate where the Commonwealth fits (or doesn't fit) in his framework. We will argue that the Commonwealth represents a path of "constitutionally constrained extraction" that Ertman's Western European focus underemphasizes.
     * **Analytical contribution**: Clarify what the Commonwealth case contributes to state formation theory: it demonstrates that institutional veto-points can prevent crisis-driven state capacity development even under extreme military pressure, challenging assumptions about the inevitability of centralization under warfare pressure.

**Minor Points**: 
We appreciate Reviewer 1's recognition that our Round 2 revisions successfully addressed the Round 1 concerns about constitutional monocausality and qualification of controversial claims. We will maintain this multi-causal framework while strengthening the evidentiary support for each causal mechanism.

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Modern History Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 2 for recognizing this as "a substantial improvement over Round 1" with a "plausible and clearly presented" core thesis (score: 6.8/10). We appreciate the detailed identification of remaining factual, chronological, and citation issues that prevent the manuscript from being "publication-ready."

**Major Points**:

1. **Citation practice too non-specific for high-stakes claims**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The manuscript currently asserts rather than demonstrates key claims because citations lack pinpoint support.
   - **Action taken**: We will add 15-20 targeted inline footnotes with precise references:
     * **Sejm collapses**: For each claimed dissolution (1649, 1651, 1652, 1653, 1654), we will cite the specific diariusz entry and/or *Volumina Legum* notation indicating ruptura or failed session. For example, the 1652 ruptura will cite both the contemporary diariusz and the relevant secondary literature (Ochmann-Staniszewska's work on the 1652 Sejm).
     * ***Volumina Legum* records**: We will specify which proposed constitutions failed by citing Sejm diaries showing proposals that did not result in enacted legislation, and cite specific VL entries for what was enacted but insufficient.
     * **Swedish memoranda/correspondence**: We will provide complete archival identifiers: "Svenska Riksarkivet, Riksregistraturet [or Diplomatica Polonica], Vol. X, fol. Y, [official/correspondent] to [recipient], dated [specific date]." If we are working from published diplomatic editions, we will cite those with page numbers.
     * **Frost citations**: Add specific page numbers for all chronological and analytical claims drawn from Frost's work.

2. **Timeline and contextual inaccuracies**
   - **Our response**: We thank Reviewer 2 for catching these important errors. The chronological compressions and oversimplifications undermine the manuscript's credibility.
   - **Action taken**: We will correct the following:
     * **Transylvania**: Remove Transylvania from the list of "concurrent 1655 invaders" and correctly date Rákóczi's major intervention to 1657. We will revise the opening to focus on the Swedish invasion (July 1655) and Muscovite invasion (summer 1654, escalating 1655) as the primary concurrent threats during the 1655 crisis moment.
     * **Brandenburg-Prussia**: Revise characterization from "invasion" to accurately reflect Brandenburg's complex role: initial alliance with Sweden (Treaty of Königsberg, January 1656), shifting to Commonwealth alliance (Treaty of Wehlau, 1657). We will clarify that Brandenburg was not a straightforward invader but a pivotal swing power whose allegiance was contested.
     * **Sejm legislative record 1649-1654**: Specify which sessions were dissolved/ruptured versus contentious but productive. We will clarify what measures actually passed (e.g., 1649 and 1651 did pass some military funding) and explain why they were insufficient rather than implying total failure. The argument will shift to "inadequate crisis response" rather than "complete legislative paralysis."

3. **Institutional claims need tighter legal-historical phrasing**
   - **Our response**: We accept that our language about "standing armies," "constitutionally protected private armies," and Tyszowce's fiscal authority oversimplifies early modern realities.
   - **Action taken**: We will revise institutional descriptions:
     * **Hetman forces**: Replace "standing army" with more accurate terminology: "komput army" (the authorized military establishment), "quartz army" (paid from the quarter tax), and distinguish these from pospolite ruszenie (noble levy) and confederated forces. We will clarify that hetmans commanded these forces with substantial operational autonomy but within a framework of theoretical Sejm authorization.
     * **Magnate private forces**: Revise from "constitutionally protected" to "socially and politically entrenched" or "customary and tolerated." We will explain that magnates' military retinues were not explicitly guaranteed by constitutional law but were embedded in the noble-republican social order and difficult to regulate without threatening noble liberties.
     * **Tyszowce fiscal authority**: Qualify the claim about "imposing extraordinary taxation." We will clarify that confederations could coordinate contributions from participants, enforce discipline, and organize military finance within their membership, but that realm-wide, durable fiscal authority still intersected with Sejm practices, treasury administration, and subsequent political ratification. The revised argument will emphasize that Tyszowce created an *alternative* fiscal-military coordination mechanism that bypassed normal Sejm procedures, rather than claiming it had unqualified taxing power.

4. **Need concrete micro-cases for mechanisms**
   - **Our response**: This is an excellent suggestion that will substantially strengthen the argument's empirical grounding.
   - **Action taken**: We will add two specific micro-cases:
     * **Fiscal/legislative mechanism**: Identify one specific tax proposal or military komput decision that was blocked or delayed (e.g., the proposed increase in the quarter tax or specific levy proposals in 1653 or 1654), cite the Sejm diary evidence, and trace the operational consequence (e.g., delayed payment to specific military units, documented in treasury records or military correspondence).
     * **Diplomatic fragmentation mechanism**: Provide one clearly cited instance of Swedish or Muscovite decision-makers explicitly referencing Commonwealth divided authority. For example, we will locate and cite a specific Swedish Riksråd memorandum or diplomatic instruction that references the expectation of Lithuanian separate negotiation or magnate defection, with exact archival reference and quotation in original language with translation.

**Minor Points**: 
We appreciate Reviewer 2's recognition of our improved structure and historiographical positioning. We will maintain the clear three-domain framework while adding the precision and concrete examples that will make it "genuinely publication-ready."

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Historiography Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank Reviewer 3 for recognizing "substantial improvement over Round 1" with "notably better legal-institutional nuance" and "clear structure" (score: 6.3/10). We appreciate the detailed methodological critique identifying verification problems and source-method mismatches.

**Major Points**:

1. **Verification remains a problem; closer to essayistic synthesis than checkable research**
   - **Our response**: We accept this fundamental criticism. The manuscript's evidentiary claims remain difficult to audit because specific page numbers, diary entries, and archival call numbers are missing.
   - **Action taken**: We will implement the citation infrastructure described in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, with particular attention to Reviewer 3's emphasis on "checkable" evidence:
     * **Sejm claims**: Each assertion about Sejm collapse, dissolution, or failed passage will be tied to specific diariusz entries (with page numbers from published editions or folio numbers from manuscript sources).
     * **Fiscal claims**: Any statement about "budget frozen" or inadequate taxation will be supported by either enacted VL constitutions (showing what was authorized) or treasury records/military pay documentation (showing what was actually collected/disbursed).
     * **Swedish/Muscovite assessments**: Complete archival identifiers (fond/series/volume/call number) or published edition citations for all diplomatic correspondence, with quotations in original language and our translations.
     * **Pasek and Frost**: Page numbers for all citations.

2. **Source-method mismatch: *Volumina Legum* cannot show what "failed"**
   - **Our response**: This is an important methodological correction. Reviewer 3 is absolutely right that *Volumina Legum* prints enacted constitutions and therefore cannot, by itself, demonstrate failed proposals or non-enactment.
   - **Action taken**: We will revise our use of *Volumina Legum* in two ways:
     * **Rephrase claims**: Change statements like "Volumina Legum records proposals that failed to achieve passage" to more accurate formulations: "Volumina Legum shows that enacted taxation measures in [years] remained at [levels], insufficient for the scale of military mobilization required, while Sejm diaries indicate that proposals for increased levies were debated but not enacted."
     * **Add appropriate sources for "failure"**: Use Sejm diaries (diariusze sejmowe), sejmik instructions (lauda), and correspondence to document what was proposed but not enacted. For example, we will cite specific diariusz passages showing debate over tax increases that ended in ruptura or non-agreement.
     * **Narrow claims where necessary**: Where we lack access to diariusze for specific sessions, we will narrow claims to what VL can demonstrate: "enacted measures were inadequate" rather than "proposals failed."

3. **Factual precision issues: Kėdainiai dating and 1653-1654 legislative narrative**
   - **Our response**: We acknowledge the need for greater precision on Kėdainiai chronology and the legislative record.
   - **Action taken**:
     * **Kėdainiai**: We will clarify the sequence and dating of the 1655 Kėdainiai agreements, distinguishing the August 1655 preliminary agreements from the October 1655 Union of Kėdainiai, and specifying which Lithuanian magnates and officials participated at each stage. We will also clarify the contested nature of these agreements—they represented one faction's wartime realignment, not a unified Lithuanian decision or a clean legal dissolution of the Union of Lublin.
     * **1653-1654 Sejms**: We will review the legislative record for these sessions and provide accurate characterization of what passed, what failed, and what was deb
