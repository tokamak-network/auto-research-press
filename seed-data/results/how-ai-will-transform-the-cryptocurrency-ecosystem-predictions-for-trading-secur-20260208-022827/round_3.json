        "The manuscript still appears incomplete/truncated (ends mid-thought in \u201cCoordinated Multi-Agent Attacks\u201d), and core promised artifacts (risk matrix table, case studies with calculations) are not visible in the provided text\u2014so the central contribution cannot be fully assessed.",
        "Remaining technical imprecision in a few crypto/security statements: (i) STARK post-quantum claims oversimplify quantum security of hash functions (Grover applies to preimage; collision has different quantum bounds than \u201cjust double bits\u201d), (ii) some FHE/TFHE performance numbers look off or too context-free (e.g., \u201810\u2013100 ms per gate\u2019 is not a stable/representative statement without parameterization), and (iii) several L2/security mechanism claims would benefit from sharper protocol-specific conditions (escape hatch timing, forced inclusion mechanisms, sequencer decentralization assumptions)."

        "Tighten remaining crypto statements: qualify ZK assumption claims carefully (which model/assumptions apply to which security property); refine STARK PQ discussion to distinguish preimage vs collision quantum security and relate to concrete parameter choices; and parameterize FHE claims (security level, N, q, circuit depth, library version, hardware) rather than giving broad timing ranges."
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "Relative to Round 2, you did address two of the three main issues substantively: (1) crypto-technical correctness is improved (notably the GMW correction and more careful ZK/FHE taxonomy), and (2) the narrative is more threat-model oriented with explicit adversary capabilities and security properties. The third issue\u2014auditable citations and complete framework instantiation\u2014cannot be confirmed from what is provided. Even though you mention URLs/snapshots (e.g., Flashbots dashboard) and claim a 127-item bibliography, the excerpt still lacks a References section, so the citation apparatus remains effectively non-auditable for peer review. On technical accuracy: your MEV discussion is broadly consistent with current Ethereum PBS/MEV-Boost realities, and you appropriately caveat private orderflow/OFA opacity; that said, the category breakdown percentages and daily MEV averages should be tied to a specific dashboard view and date range because these shift materially with market regime and measurement methodology. In cryptography, the ZK section is much better, but a few statements remain too categorical: STARK \u2018post-quantum\u2019 security depends on the hash function\u2019s quantum security (preimage vs collision), and the \u2018128\u2192256-bit\u2019 guidance is an oversimplification; similarly, FHE/TFHE performance claims should be parameterized (scheme parameters, bootstrapping configuration, and library/hardware) to avoid misleading generalization. Finally, several protocol-security claims would benefit from sharper conditions: for L2s, specify concrete forced-inclusion/escape-hatch mechanisms per rollup family and the time-to-safety/liveness tradeoffs; for PBS, distinguish relay-level censorship risks from proposer-level censorship and note how inclusion lists/enshrined PBS change the threat model. Overall: strong progress, but still not publication-ready without (i) fully verifiable references in the submitted text and (ii) complete, reproducible framework outputs visible to the reviewer.",

For L2 sequencers/relays, quantify DDoS threat models (bandwidth, connection exhaustion, mempool spam) and defenses (anycast front-doors, rate-limits, admission control, fallback paths, forced-inclusion/escape hatch timing)."
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "Relative to Round 2, the manuscript shows clear improvements in technical correctness and definitional rigor: the corrected characterization of GMW as computational (via OT instantiations) and the nuanced dYdX architecture description eliminate prior inaccuracies, and the addition of explicit cryptographic games (IND-CPA/EUF-CMA/simulation-based MPC) is a genuine step toward rigor. That said, the central Round-2 network-security request was not merely more enumeration but a demonstrable, evaluated end-to-end infrastructure threat model with measurable properties and residual risk. In the provided excerpt, the network layer is still mostly framed at the architectural level (CEX/DEX/L2) and at the AI-attack technique level (model extraction/poisoning), without the promised infrastructure case studies visible (eclipse/BGP/RPC/Sequencer DDoS). Because those sections/tables are not included here, I cannot verify that the predictive framework artifact (risk matrix across AI capabilities \u00d7 attack surfaces \u00d7 time horizons) actually exists in the revised manuscript, nor can I assess the validity of any quantitative risk estimates. On citations, the text contains many precise numbers and vendor-derived performance claims (e.g., MEV breakdown percentages and dollar amounts; Bitwise \u201895% fabricated volume\u2019; Elliptic detection rates; exchange throughput/API limits). These are plausible but remain under-audited in the excerpt because the references are still author-year style without a visible, checkable bibliography; for security research, especially where policy or operational recommendations follow, auditability is essential. Finally, for network security specifically, the paper would benefit from integrating Internet routing realities: RPKI/ROV is not a complete solution (origin validation does not stop route leaks and has uneven adoption), and RPC/provider centralization is a critical dependency that should be modeled as a concrete trust and availability bottleneck (including BGP/DNS hijack, TLS termination compromise, and quorum/multi-provider strategies). If the promised Section 4.4 and Table 3 are indeed present in the full manuscript, ensure they include explicit assumptions, success metrics, and reproducible data sources\u2014otherwise the work remains closer to a high-quality survey than a validated predictive security framework.",

      "detailed_feedback": "This Round 3 revision demonstrates genuine and substantial engagement with the cryptographic critique from Round 2. The addition of formal security games with explicit advantage definitions (IND-CPA, EUF-CMA, simulation-based MPC) represents a major improvement that elevates the manuscript to publication-quality rigor in its treatment of core cryptographic primitives. The security game formulations are technically correct, use standard notation, and properly specify negligible probability bounds - this is exactly what was requested and addresses the primary weakness identified in Round 2.\n\nThe quantum security analysis is now comprehensive and technically sound, with concrete resource requirements for Shor's algorithm (2330 logical qubits for secp256k1 per Roetteler et al. 2017), detailed coverage of NIST PQC standardization results (CRYSTALS-Kyber, Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+), and realistic assessment of migration challenges including signature size increases and computational overhead. The distinction between Shor's algorithm (affecting number-theoretic cryptography) and Grover's algorithm (providing quadratic speedup for unstructured search) is correctly made, and the characterization of STARKs as post-quantum secure through reliance on collision-resistant hash functions is accurate. This section could serve as a standalone reference on quantum threats to cryptocurrency systems.\n\nThe zero-knowledge proof system treatment is significantly improved with proper specification of security assumptions for each construction. The characterization of Groth16's reliance on KEA as a non-falsifiable assumption is honest and important - many treatments gloss over this limitation. The distinction between computational, statistical, and perfect zero-knowledge is correctly made, and the tradeoffs between proof size, verification time, trusted setup requirements, and security assumptions are clearly articulated. The concrete parameter recommendations (ring dimensions, security levels, proof sizes) with performance metrics enable practitioners to make informed implementation decisions.\n\nHowever, several areas still require attention. First, while the author response claims to have added 'New Section 4.4: Network Infrastructure Threat Models and Evaluation with three concrete case studies,' this section is not visible in the provided manuscript excerpt, making it impossible to verify whether the promised formalization of eclipse attacks, BGP hijacks, and sequencer DDoS scenarios with quantified security properties was actually implemented. Similarly, the claimed expansion of Section 5.3 on smart contract verification with decidability analysis and soundness/completeness tradeoffs cannot be verified. This creates uncertainty about whether the manuscript truly addresses these critiques or whether the improvements exist only in the author response.\n\nSecond, some cryptographic specifications remain incomplete. The threshold encryption discussion mentions Shutter Network's use of 'BLS threshold signatures with t-of-n threshold' but doesn't specify the actual threshold parameters, doesn't clarify whether this is threshold encryption (enabling decryption only when t parties cooperate) or threshold signatures (enabling signing only when t parties cooperate), and doesn't provide the security reduction details. FROST is characterized as providing 'single-round signing after preprocessing phase' but the preprocessing communication complexity and security model (does it tolerate dishonest majority? what happens if preprocessing is compromised?) are not specified. These details matter for security analysis.\n\nThird, the privacy property formalizations, while well-structured, could be strengthened by explicitly modeling adversary capabilities. The anonymity game defines sender anonymity through a distinguishing game but doesn't specify whether the adversary can observe network traffic (IP addresses, packet timing), whether they control some fraction of network nodes, or whether they can compromise some participants. These capabilities dramatically affect achievable anonymity - for example, a global passive adversary who observes all network traffic can often deanonymize users through traffic analysis even when cryptographic anonymity holds. Making these adversary capabilities explicit would provide more realistic security assessments.\n\nFourth, while the manuscript now cites security properties and cryptographic constructions, it rarely provides explicit security reductions or proof sketches. When asserting that a protocol provides certain security properties, the manuscript should either cite the specific theorem and proof from literature (with theorem numbers and page references) or provide a sketch showing how security reduces to underlying assumptions. For example, the claim that 'Protocol X provides censorship resistance' should be supported by either a citation to a formal proof or a sketch showing how an adversary violating censorship resistance could be used to break an underlying hardness assumption. This would distinguish proven security from heuristic or conjectural claims.\n\nDespite these remaining gaps, this revision represents a substantial achievement. The authors have successfully transformed a manuscript that lacked cryptographic rigor into one that demonstrates publication-quality formalism in its treatment of core security properties. The quantum security analysis is comprehensive and technically sound. The zero-knowledge proof system treatment is detailed and accurate. The overall trajectory from Round 1 through Round 3 shows genuine engagement with reviewer feedback and substantial improvement in technical quality. With minor revisions to address the remaining specification gaps and verification of the claimed but invisible sections, this manuscript would be suitable for publication in a top-tier venue.",

Both reviewers acknowledge the technical corrections from Round 2 have been implemented and note improved rigor, scoping, and precision. Their remaining requests\u2014more detailed threshold cryptography specifications, expanded privacy game definitions, additional case study instantiation\u2014are reasonable suggestions for strengthening but do not constitute fatal deficiencies for a comprehensive survey/framework paper in this domain.\n\nExercising editorial judgment: this is a final round with no further revision possible.

The core contribution\u2014a systematic framework for analyzing AI-driven threats to cryptocurrency infrastructure with proper cryptographic formalism\u2014is valuable to both researchers and practitioners.
