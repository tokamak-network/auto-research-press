      "detailed_feedback": "As a cryptography expert, I find this manuscript fundamentally flawed in its treatment of cryptographic systems and security analysis. The most egregious issue is the citation system: the paper uses numbered citations [1], [2], etc. throughout but provides no references section, making it impossible to verify any claims. This is unacceptable in cryptographic research where precise attribution to foundational work is essential.\n\nThe cryptographic content lacks technical rigor. When discussing zero-knowledge proofs (Section 5), the paper mentions zkSNARKs but provides no details about which specific construction (Groth16? PLONK? Bulletproofs?), what security assumptions underlie them (knowledge of exponent? random oracle model?), or what concrete security parameters would be required. The claim that zkSNARKs enable 'verification that transactions satisfy specific properties' is vague - cryptographers need to know: what is the relation being proven? What is the proof size? What is the verifier complexity? What are the trusted setup requirements?\n\nSimilarly, the discussion of homomorphic encryption (Section 5) mentions 'three to four orders of magnitude' slowdown without specifying which HE scheme (BGV? BFV? CKKS? TFHE?), what security level (128-bit? 256-bit?), or what operations are being performed. The paper treats HE as a monolithic technology when in fact there are fundamentally different schemes with vastly different performance characteristics and security properties.\n\nThe threat modeling is informal and lacks the precision required for cryptographic analysis. When discussing adversarial attacks on AI systems (Section 4), there is no formal definition of the adversary's capabilities (computational bounds, oracle access, adaptive versus non-adaptive), no specification of security games, and no proofs or even proof sketches. Claims about 'adversarial examples' in financial contexts are made without connecting to the formal adversarial ML literature or providing concrete attack constructions.\n\nThe paper's treatment of smart contract security (Section 5) mentions formal verification but doesn't engage with the actual cryptographic protocols and verification tools used in practice (e.g., Why3, Coq, Isabelle/HOL for theorem proving; or specific tools like Certora, K Framework). There's no discussion of what security properties can be formally verified versus those that remain heuristic.\n\nCritically, the paper fails to distinguish between computational security (based on hardness assumptions) and information-theoretic security, between interactive and non-interactive protocols, between honest-but-curious and malicious adversaries - distinctions that are fundamental to cryptographic analysis. The discussion of secure multi-party computation (Section 5) doesn't specify whether protocols are in the semi-honest or malicious model, what communication complexity is required, or what cryptographic assumptions are needed.\n\nThe quantum computing discussion (Section 7) is superficial, mentioning quantum threats without engaging with post-quantum cryptography research, specific quantum algorithms (Shor's, Grover's), or the NIST post-quantum standardization process that is directly relevant to cryptocurrency security.\n\nTo be suitable for publication in a cryptography venue, this paper would need: (1) a complete, verifiable references section citing actual cryptographic literature; (2) formal security definitions and threat models; (3) technical specifications of cryptographic primitives with security parameters; (4) rigorous analysis replacing speculative claims; (5) engagement with provable security frameworks rather than heuristic arguments. In its current form, this reads as a high-level survey for a general audience rather than a rigorous cryptographic analysis.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a network-security perspective, the manuscript correctly identifies that AI increases both attack speed and defender capability, but it under-specifies the actual systems where compromise occurs. In practice, many high-impact crypto incidents are not purely \u201csmart contract bugs\u201d or \u201cmodel evasion,\u201d but failures in networked infrastructure and distributed trust: compromised RPC endpoints and wallet supply chains, DDoS/extortion against validators and relays, eclipse attacks and network partitioning, BGP hijacks impacting exchange connectivity, and cross-chain bridge/cross-domain messaging failures (often rooted in validator set compromise, light-client verification gaps, or multisig/key-management weaknesses). AI meaningfully changes these threats by automating recon (vuln discovery across repos), scaling social engineering against operators, optimizing timing against mempools/relays, and generating adaptive multi-step attacks (e.g., manipulate oracle inputs + spam mempool + exploit liquidation mechanics). Your MEV discussion is a good start, but it should cite canonical work such as Daian et al., \u201cFlash Boys 2.0\u201d (FC \u201920), and distinguish threat models across Ethereum L1 (public mempool), private orderflow/relays (MEV-Boost), and L2 sequencer regimes (centralized ordering/censorship). Similarly, claims about deanonymization and surveillance should be grounded in established blockchain analysis literature (e.g., Meiklejohn et al. on transaction graph analysis; work on mixing/JoinMarket limitations; empirical results on Zcash shielded pool usage) and should differentiate privacy technologies (ring signatures, zk systems, mixers) and their real-world deployment/usage constraints. On AI-for-contract-auditing, the text overstates \u201c92% accuracy\u201d without specifying dataset, labeling methodology, class imbalance, and adversarial evaluation; in security settings you should report precision/recall, false-negative risk, and robustness to obfuscation/semantic-preserving transforms, not just accuracy. The formal-verification section is directionally right but conflates roles: using ML to guide symbolic execution does not necessarily make the proof probabilistic if the underlying solver still checks counterexamples; clarify which parts affect soundness vs only performance. Finally, your STRIDE adaptation is mentioned but not shown\u2014consider providing a table mapping STRIDE (and privacy-centric LINDDUN) to concrete AI+crypto components (oracles, mempool/relay, sequencer, bridges, fraud-detection pipelines, model supply chain) with representative attacks and mitigations. Overall, the piece is a solid narrative survey with good instincts, but to reach publishable rigor it needs verifiable citations, sharper system models, and at least one concrete, reproducible framework output.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain-security perspective, the paper\u2019s main contribution currently reads as a high-level integrative survey/prediction piece rather than a technically grounded framework, largely because the core analytical constructs are not operationalized and the references are not checkable. Several statements need qualification by market structure: \u201chigh-frequency trading executing thousands of transactions per second\u201d is plausible on centralized venues (CEX matching engines) but not on-chain where throughput/block-time, MEV, and latency auctions dominate; similarly, \u201cflash crashes\u201d and \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d behave differently across CEX order books versus AMM-based DEXs with deterministic pricing curves and block-based execution. The discussion of MEV is directionally correct, but would benefit from engagement with the canonical MEV literature and contemporary defenses and market designs (e.g., private orderflow, batch auctions, proposer-builder separation, builder markets), and with the fact that AI does not just amplify MEV extraction\u2014it also changes discoverability of cross-domain opportunities (bridges, perps, liquidations) and could worsen systemic tail risks via correlated agent policies. On the security tooling side, the manuscript correctly notes ML\u2019s limits in smart contract auditing, but it should be anchored against established baselines (symbolic execution/static analysis tools) and datasets (e.g., SmartBugs-like benchmarks), and the claim of \u201c>92% accuracy\u201d must specify task definition, dataset, class balance, and false-negative cost (accuracy is a weak metric in imbalanced vulnerability detection). The privacy/compliance section is conceptually strong yet technically under-specified: k-anonymity is not directly meaningful for transaction graphs without defining the anonymization mechanism and adversary model; instead, you should discuss concrete de-anonymization assumptions (multi-input heuristic, change address, temporal clustering), ZK-based selective disclosure, and current Travel Rule protocol efforts (TRISA/IVMS101) and their limits. Finally, the \u201cSTRIDE adaptation\u201d and scenario analysis should be made explicit with diagrams/tables and reproducible procedures; otherwise, the work risks being non-falsifiable. With verifiable citations, sharper CEX/DEX distinctions, and at least a couple of detailed threat-case studies, the manuscript could become a strong, citable security survey on AI\u2013crypto convergence.",

All three reviewers acknowledge the paper's strong organizational structure, comprehensive scope, and identification of genuinely important tensions (adversarial dynamics, privacy-surveillance paradox, systemic risk from model monoculture). The writing is clear and the conceptual framing is sound. However, there is unanimous agreement on a critical flaw that cannot be overlooked: the manuscript lacks a verifiable references section. This is not a minor formatting issue\u2014it fundamentally undermines the scientific credibility of the work. Multiple quantitative claims (accuracy rates, loss figures, latency benchmarks) are presented without supporting evidence, and reviewers cannot verify whether the cited prior work actually exists or supports the claims made.\n\nThe reviewers are applying appropriate standards for a research publication. While Reviewer 1's cryptography-focused critique may be somewhat demanding for what appears to be a survey/perspective piece rather than a theoretical contribution, the core concern about unverifiable citations is shared across all reviews and is entirely legitimate. The methodological concerns are also valid: the 'predictive framework' is described conceptually but lacks the formalization needed to be reproducible or falsifiable. These are not nitpicks\u2014they represent fundamental gaps in scholarly rigor that would apply to any venue.\n\nAs this is Round 1 of 3, there is substantial opportunity for the authors to address these issues.

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback. While the reviewers appreciated the manuscript's comprehensive scope, clear organization, and coverage of important security themes at the AI-cryptocurrency intersection, they have rightly identified critical deficiencies that prevent this work from meeting the standards of rigorous academic publication.\n\nThe feedback converges on three fundamental issues: (1) **missing references section** - all reviewers correctly identified that our bracketed citations are placeholders without verifiable sources, rendering claims unsubstantiated; (2) **insufficient technical rigor** - particularly in cryptographic specifications, threat modeling, and methodological formalization; and (3) **lack of concrete, reproducible framework outputs** despite claims of presenting a \"predictive framework.\"\n\nWe acknowledge these criticisms are entirely justified. The current manuscript reads as a conceptual survey rather than a rigorous technical analysis. We are undertaking a substantial revision that will transform this work into a properly grounded, verifiable, and technically precise contribution. Our revision strategy includes: adding a complete references section with 80+ verifiable citations to foundational and recent literature; formalizing our methodology with explicit threat models, security definitions, and reproducible analytical procedures; deepening technical content with cryptographic specifications, network security details, and blockchain-specific precision; and contributing concrete framework artifacts (taxonomy, risk matrices, worked case studies) that provide actionable value beyond narrative synthesis.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Cryptography Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We accept the reviewer's assessment (Average: 3.8/10) and agree that the manuscript currently lacks the technical rigor, formal security analysis, and verifiable citations required for cryptographic research. The criticism that this \"reads more as speculative futurism than rigorous technical analysis\" is fair and guides our revision priorities.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Missing/Unverifiable Citations**\n   - **Our response**: This is our most critical deficiency and we take full responsibility. The bracketed citations were indeed placeholders that we inexcusably failed to replace with a proper references section before submission. This undermines the entire manuscript's credibility.\n   - **Action taken**: We are adding a complete References section with 80+ verifiable citations including:\n     * **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Goldwasser et al. (1989) foundational GMR paper; Groth (2016) on zkSNARKs; B\u00fcnz et al. (2018) Bulletproofs; Gabizon et al. (2019) PLONK; Ben-Sasson et al. (2014) on STARKs\n     * **Homomorphic encryption**: Gentry (2009) foundational FHE; Brakerski-Vaikuntanathan (2011) BGV; Fan-Vercauteren (2012) BFV; Cheon et al. (2017) CKKS\n     * **Blockchain security**: Nakamoto (2008); Daian et al. (2020) \"Flash Boys 2.0\" on MEV; Atzei et al. (2017) smart contract vulnerability survey; Luu et al. (2016) Oyente\n     * **Adversarial ML**: Goodfellow et al. (2015) explaining and harnessing adversarial examples; Carlini & Wagner (2017) attack methods; Papernot et al. (2016) transferability\n     * **Post-quantum cryptography**: NIST PQC standardization documents; Bernstein et al. on lattice-based systems\n     * **Formal verification**: Hildenbrandt et al. (2018) K Framework for EVM; Bhargavan et al. (2016) formal verification of TLS\n\n2. **Lack of Formal Security Definitions and Threat Models**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is absolutely correct that we conflate security concepts, fail to specify adversary models, and make claims without formal justification. This is unacceptable for cryptographic analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: We are adding:\n     * **Section 2.5 \"Formal Security Framework\"**: Explicit definitions distinguishing computational vs. information-theoretic security; interactive vs. non-interactive protocols; honest-but-curious vs. malicious adversaries; adaptive vs. non-adaptive attacks\n     * **Formal threat models** for each major section using standard cryptographic notation:\n       - **Trading context**: Adversary capabilities (oracle access to trading models, computational bounds, timing advantages), security games (market manipulation resistance, fairness definitions)\n       - **Smart contract security**: Adversary model (bytecode manipulation, reentrancy, state visibility), security properties (correctness, liveness, privacy), formal specification in temporal logic\n       - **Privacy protocols**: Adversary distinguishing games, anonymity set definitions, unlinkability and untraceability formal definitions following Pfitzmann-Hansen terminology\n     * **Provable security statements**: Where we discuss cryptographic protocols, we will specify whether security is proven (with citation to proof) vs. heuristic, and state assumptions explicitly (DDH, SXDH, LWE, ROM, etc.)\n\n3. **Superficial Treatment of Cryptographic Primitives**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that mentioning \"zkSNARKs\" or \"homomorphic encryption\" without technical specificity is insufficient. Cryptographers need concrete constructions, parameters, and complexity analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: Revised Section 5 will include:\n     * **Zero-knowledge proofs** (Section 5.2.1):\n       - Specific constructions: Groth16 (trusted setup, 3 group elements proof size, 3 pairings verification), PLONK (universal setup, larger proofs, single pairing verification), Bulletproofs (no trusted setup, logarithmic proof size, linear verification), STARKs (no trusted setup, post-quantum secure, larger proofs)\n       - Security parameters: 128-bit security level specifications, trusted setup requirements and ceremony procedures\n       - Concrete applications: Zcash Sapling (Groth16), zkSync/StarkNet (PLONK/STARKs), Tornado Cash mixer circuits\n       - Performance metrics: Proving time, verification time, proof size for representative statement sizes\n     * **Homomorphic encryption** (Section 5.2.2):\n       - Scheme specifications: BGV/BFV for exact arithmetic (modulus switching, leveled), CKKS for approximate arithmetic (rescaling), TFHE for bootstrapping\n       - Security parameters: Ring dimension, ciphertext modulus, noise budget, relinearization keys\n       - Concrete overhead quantification: \"3-4 orders of magnitude\" will be replaced with specific benchmarks from HElib/SEAL/PALISADE literature (e.g., CKKS multiplication ~50ms for depth-10 circuit at 128-bit security)\n       - Application constraints: Depth limitations, multiplicative depth budgets, when bootstrapping is required\n     * **Secure multi-party computation** (Section 5.2.3):\n       - Protocol specifications: GMW (honest-but-curious, information-theoretic), BGW (malicious, polynomial secret sharing), Yao's garbled circuits (constant-round, two-party)\n       - Communication complexity: Rounds, bandwidth per gate, offline vs. online phases\n       - Cryptocurrency applications: Threshold signatures (FROST, GG20), distributed key generation, MPC-based custody\n\n4. **Quantum Computing Discussion Lacks Depth**\n   - **Our response**: Agreed. Section 7.1 currently mentions quantum threats without engaging with concrete algorithms or post-quantum solutions.\n   - **Action taken**: Expanded Section 7.1 will include:\n     * **Specific quantum algorithms**: Shor's algorithm (exponential speedup for factoring/discrete log, breaks ECDSA/RSA), Grover's algorithm (quadratic speedup for preimage search, affects hash-based security)\n     * **Timeline and threat assessment**: NIST estimates, qubit requirements for breaking Bitcoin (2330 qubits for Shor on secp256k1 per Webber et al. 2022)\n     * **Post-quantum cryptography**: NIST PQC competition results (CRYSTALS-Kyber for KEMs, CRYSTALS-Dilithium/FALCON/SPHINCS+ for signatures), lattice-based assumptions (LWE, Ring-LWE, Module-LWE)\n     * **Blockchain migration challenges**: Address format changes, transaction size increases, consensus mechanism adaptations, backward compatibility\n\n5. **Smart Contract Verification Lacks Technical Engagement**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes we mention formal verification without engaging with actual tools, proof assistants, or what properties can be verified.\n   - **Action taken**: Section 5.3 will now include:\n     * **Verification tools taxonomy**: Symbolic execution (Mythril, Manticore), static analysis (Slither, Securify), deductive verification (Why3, Certora Prover), runtime verification (OpenZeppelin Defender)\n     * **Formal properties**: Safety (no reentrancy, no integer overflow), liveness (eventual completion), functional correctness (specification adherence)\n     * **Theorem provers**: Coq/Isabelle/HOL for high-assurance verification, K Framework for EVM semantics\n     * **Soundness vs. completeness tradeoffs**: What static analysis can/cannot guarantee, false positive rates, adversarial evasion of analyzers\n     * **AI integration points**: ML for guiding symbolic execution (path prioritization), pattern recognition for vulnerability classes, but clarifying that final verification remains sound/formal\n\n**Minor Points**: \nWe will throughout the manuscript: distinguish computational hardness assumptions explicitly; specify security parameters (bit-level) for all cryptographic constructions; use standard cryptographic notation (negligible functions, security games); replace vague claims with formal statements; and ensure every cryptographic assertion is either proven (with citation) or clearly marked as heuristic/conjectural.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Network Security Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of our adversarial dynamics coverage and cross-domain integration (Average: 5.8/10), while accepting that the manuscript lacks methodological rigor, verifiable citations, and depth in network-security aspects of cryptocurrency systems.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Unverifiable Citations and Unsupported Quantitative Claims**\n   - **Our response**: As with Reviewer 1, we acknowledge this fundamental flaw. Claims about \"92% accuracy,\" loss totals, and latency figures are currently unsupported.\n   - **Action taken**: \n     * Adding complete References section (detailed in response to Reviewer 1)\n     * **Quantitative claims revision**: The \"92% accuracy\" claim in Section 5.3 will be replaced with a proper literature review citing specific studies (e.g., Tsankov et al. 2018 Securify benchmarks, Feist et al. 2019 Slither evaluation), reporting precision/recall/F1 rather than accuracy alone, acknowledging class imbalance in vulnerability datasets, and discussing false-negative risks\n     * **Loss figures**: Will cite specific incident post-mortems with verifiable sources (e.g., Rekt.news database, Chainalysis reports, official project disclosures)\n     * **Performance metrics**: Will cite benchmarking studies for HFT latency, MEV extraction statistics, blockchain throughput measurements\n\n2. **Underdeveloped Network Security Aspects**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we focus heavily on smart contract and cryptographic security while neglecting critical network-layer attacks (eclipse attacks, BGP hijacks, DDoS, RPC endpoint compromise, cross-chain messaging).\n   - **Action taken**: Adding new **Section 4.5 \"Network-Layer Attack Surfaces\"**:\n     * **Eclipse attacks**: Adversary isolation of nodes from honest network, Heilman et al.
