      "detailed_feedback": "From a security analysis perspective, this manuscript covers important ground but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive security analysis. The formal security definitions in Sections 2.1.1 and 3.1.1 are a good start, but the soundness and completeness properties for fraud proofs need tighter specification - particularly around the computational model and what 'PPT adversary' means in the context of interactive protocols with timing constraints. The cryptographic assumptions table in Section 3.1.2 is concerning in its brevity: the Knowledge of Exponent Assumption (KEA) is labeled 'non-standard' without discussing the implications of its potential falsification beyond a single sentence, and the Algebraic Group Model's limitations in capturing real-world attacks deserve deeper treatment. The manuscript correctly identifies that STARK security relies on collision-resistant hash functions, but doesn't address the concrete security bounds or how the hash function instantiation affects the overall security level. The prover centralization analysis in Section 3.4 identifies risks but doesn't formally model the security degradation - what exactly can a malicious prover do given current architectures? The claim that 'soundness is preserved' in proof markets needs justification: while proofs are verified on-chain, a malicious prover could potentially exploit timing, submit proofs for reorged transactions, or engage in selective proving that affects liveness in security-critical ways. The bridge security section is practically useful but the formal security composition claim that 'Security = min(Ethereum consensus, DA layer, Proof system)' is an oversimplification that could mislead practitioners - security composition in layered systems is rarely a simple minimum function and depends critically on the specific properties being composed.",

      "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript represents a solid technical survey of rollup security mechanisms with commendable attention to formal rigor. The security game formulations in Section 2.1.1 and the formal definitions of circuit vulnerabilities in Section 3.3.1 demonstrate appropriate academic rigor. However, several issues warrant attention for a complete review. First, the document is clearly incomplete - Section 4.3.2 ends mid-sentence with an empty table, and the promised analysis of 'upgrade governance risks and emergency intervention mechanisms' from the abstract is entirely missing. This is a significant gap given that upgrade mechanisms represent one of the most critical trust assumptions in current rollup deployments. Second, while the challenge period analysis in Section 2.3 is reasonable, it lacks formal treatment of the economic security bounds - what is the minimum stake required to make fraud proof submission incentive-compatible? How do gas price fluctuations affect the security guarantees? Third, the bridge security analysis, while comprehensive in identifying vulnerability classes, would benefit from a systematic threat model that considers different adversary capabilities (sequencer compromise vs. external attacker vs. governance attack). The cross-layer reentrancy discussion is valuable but could be strengthened with formal invariants that secure bridges should maintain. Finally, the paper would benefit from a clearer distinction between theoretical security properties and the current state of deployed systems - many rollups operate with training wheels (security councils, upgrade keys) that fundamentally alter the trust model from what the theoretical analysis suggests.",

      "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript represents a solid technical survey that will be valuable to practitioners and researchers entering the rollup security space. The formalization efforts are commendable - the security games for fraud proof soundness, the formal definitions of circuit vulnerabilities, and the quantitative analysis of challenge period adequacy all demonstrate rigorous thinking. However, several issues require attention before this work reaches publication quality.\n\nThe most pressing concern is completeness - the manuscript is clearly truncated, with an empty table in Section 4.3.2 and missing sections that were promised in the introduction (forward-looking analysis, actionable recommendations). This makes comprehensive review impossible.\n\nRegarding the specific focus areas requested: The data availability sampling treatment is strong, with proper formalization of security bounds and good discussion of the interaction between blob pruning windows and challenge periods. However, the sequencer centralization analysis, while identifying the risks well, could go deeper on censorship resistance mechanisms - the force-inclusion analysis is good but doesn't fully address scenarios where L1 itself faces congestion or censorship pressure. Most notably, the L1-L2 security inheritance model needs substantial strengthening. The manuscript states rollups 'inherit' L1 security but doesn't rigorously define what this means. Key questions remain unaddressed: What happens to rollup security during L1 reorgs beyond the finality threshold? How do different L1 finality assumptions (Ethereum's LMD-GHOST vs. Casper FFG finality) affect rollup security properties? What are the formal conditions under which the security composition formula presented actually holds?\n\nThe novelty score reflects that this is primarily a synthesis work rather than presenting new theoretical results or empirical findings. This is acceptable for a survey paper, but the contribution would be strengthened by original analysis - perhaps formal verification of specific protocol implementations or novel attack vector identification.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive survey of rollup security mechanisms that demonstrates strong technical understanding and provides valuable formalization of security models for both optimistic and ZK-rollup architectures. All three reviewers consistently praised the well-structured formal security definitions, clear exposition, and practical grounding with specific protocol analysis. The comparative analysis between rollup approaches and the treatment of data availability concerns were noted as particular strengths.\n\nHowever, the reviews converge on several significant concerns that prevent acceptance in the current form. Most critically, the manuscript appears to be incomplete\u2014multiple reviewers noted truncation at Section 4.3.2 with an empty audit findings table and missing sections on upgrade governance and emergency intervention mechanisms that were promised in the scope. This incompleteness alone necessitates major revision. Beyond structural issues, reviewers identified substantive gaps: the cryptographic assumption analysis lacks rigor (no reduction-based security analysis or tightness discussion), empirical validation is weak (MEV estimates are extrapolations without clear methodology), and the L1-L2 security inheritance model lacks formal treatment of finality assumptions. The novelty contribution is also limited, as the work primarily synthesizes existing knowledge rather than presenting new frameworks or attack vectors.\n\nWhile the foundation is solid and the topic is timely, the combination of incomplete content, insufficient cryptographic rigor, and limited empirical validation represents a gap between current state and publication readiness that requires substantial work to address.",

    "recommendation": "The manuscript addresses an important topic and has a solid foundation, but requires substantial completion and strengthening before it can be accepted.

Given this is round 2 of 3, authors have one more opportunity to address these concerns comprehensively.",
