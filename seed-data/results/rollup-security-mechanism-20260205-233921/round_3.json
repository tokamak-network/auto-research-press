      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a general security perspective, this manuscript represents strong work that successfully bridges theoretical foundations with practical implementation analysis. The formalization of the bisection protocol security proof and the detailed treatment of cryptographic assumptions are particularly valuable contributions. However, several areas warrant attention for a complete security analysis.\n\nThe treatment of bridge contracts is notably thin given their historical significance as attack vectors (Ronin, Wormhole, Nomad bridges collectively lost over $1B). The manuscript should formalize the security properties required for cross-layer message passing, including message ordering guarantees, replay protection mechanisms, and the trust assumptions in message relayers. The current discussion of L1-L2 security inheritance would benefit from explicit treatment of how bridge contract vulnerabilities can break the security inheritance model.\n\nThe withdrawal mechanism analysis, while including useful economic considerations, lacks formal treatment of the withdrawal proof verification process itself. Questions such as: What happens if a withdrawal proof references a state root that gets challenged? How do fast withdrawal providers verify proof validity before fronting funds? What are the exact conditions under which a withdrawal can be censored or delayed? These deserve rigorous analysis.\n\nThe upgrade governance section is particularly underdeveloped relative to its importance. The Security Council mechanisms mentioned for Arbitrum and Optimism represent significant trust assumptions that could override the cryptographic and economic security guarantees analyzed elsewhere. A formal threat model for upgrade mechanisms\u2014including analysis of timelock adequacy, multisig compromise scenarios, and the tension between emergency response capability and decentralization\u2014would strengthen the manuscript considerably.\n\nThe empirical data sources are well-documented, which is commendable. However, the manuscript would benefit from sensitivity analysis on key parameters\u2014for instance, how do the security conclusions change if L1 censorship resistance degrades due to validator concentration trends?\n\nFinally, the abrupt truncation suggests this is incomplete work. The circuit vulnerability case study was building toward important conclusions that are now missing. Completing this section and ensuring all promised analysis is delivered would significantly improve the manuscript's value.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a security analysis perspective, this manuscript makes solid contributions to systematizing rollup security knowledge, particularly in its formalization of the optimistic rollup security model and comparative cryptographic assumption analysis. The proof of the bisection protocol theorem is correct and well-presented, and the treatment of network synchrony assumptions appropriately captures the realistic partially synchronous model. However, several areas warrant deeper investigation. First, the soundness analysis for ZK-rollups should address the concrete security of deployed systems more rigorously - for instance, what is the actual soundness error when accounting for the number of proofs verified over the system's lifetime? The birthday bound implications for systems processing millions of proofs deserve attention. Second, the manuscript would benefit from analyzing composition security: when multiple rollups share infrastructure (sequencers, provers, bridges), how do correlated failures affect the aggregate security? Third, the economic security analysis for fraud proofs, while useful, doesn't adequately address the game-theoretic equilibria - specifically, under what conditions might rational challengers coordinate to not challenge (e.g., if challenging reveals profitable MEV strategies)? The KEA assumption discussion is valuable but should note recent work on falsifiable alternatives and their applicability to deployed systems. Finally, the circuit vulnerability framework is a good start but would benefit from connection to formal methods literature on constraint system analysis and automated vulnerability detection tools currently in development.",

      "detailed_feedback": "This manuscript demonstrates strong technical competence in formalizing rollup security mechanisms. The treatment of optimistic rollup fraud proofs is particularly well-done, with the bisection protocol proof being mathematically rigorous and the economic analysis providing actionable insights. The cryptographic foundations section for ZK-rollups shows good understanding of the assumption hierarchy and the practical implications of different proof systems.\n\nHowever, several issues need attention. First, the manuscript is incomplete - it cuts off during the circuit vulnerability case study, and critical topics promised in the scope (data availability sampling, sequencer centralization, L1-L2 finality) are not adequately covered. The data availability section is especially important given its centrality to rollup security; the current treatment is superficial.\n\nSecond, while the formal models are sound, some claims need qualification. The 1-of-N honest assumption analysis should more explicitly address the distinction between theoretical and practical honest parties - having one honest observer is different from having one honest observer with sufficient capital, infrastructure, and incentive to challenge. The economic analysis begins this but doesn't fully connect to the formal model.\n\nThird, the treatment of ZK-rollup prover centralization is mentioned but not analyzed in depth. Given that most ZK-rollups currently have single provers, this represents a significant trust assumption that deserves formal treatment similar to the sequencer analysis for optimistic rollups.\n\nFinally, the manuscript would benefit from a threat model taxonomy that clearly distinguishes between: (1) cryptographic attacks on proof systems, (2) economic attacks on incentive mechanisms, (3) operational attacks on infrastructure, and (4) governance attacks on upgrade mechanisms. This would help readers understand the multi-layered nature of rollup security.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript presents a comprehensive and technically rigorous analysis of rollup security mechanisms, demonstrating strong expertise in both optimistic and ZK-rollup architectures. All three reviewers consistently praised the excellent formalization of security models, including well-constructed security games, reduction-based analysis, and rigorous treatment of cryptographic assumptions. The empirical grounding with specific protocol parameters, TVL data, and concrete vulnerability case studies from actual audits significantly strengthens the practical relevance of the work. The comparative analysis of cryptographic assumptions and the treatment of economic security considerations (stake derivation, gas price sensitivity, incentive compatibility) represent notable contributions to the systematization of knowledge in this domain.\n\nHowever, all reviewers identified a critical structural issue: the manuscript is incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence in Section 3.3.3, leaving promised sections on data availability, bridge security, and upgrade governance unaddressed. This truncation is particularly problematic given that bridge contract vulnerabilities and cross-layer message verification were explicitly identified as key review focus areas. Additionally, reviewers noted limited novelty beyond systematization, insufficient treatment of emerging topics (shared sequencing, cross-rollup security, recursive proof composition), and gaps in the analysis of prover centralization risks and L1-L2 security inheritance. While the technical quality of the completed sections is high (accuracy scores of 8/10 across all reviewers), the incompleteness prevents acceptance in the current form.\n\nGiven that this is the final review round and the average score of 7.4 falls within the minor revision range, the manuscript merits conditional acceptance pending completion of the missing sections. The core technical contributions are sound and valuable to the research community, and the identified gaps are addressable without fundamental restructuring of the work.",
