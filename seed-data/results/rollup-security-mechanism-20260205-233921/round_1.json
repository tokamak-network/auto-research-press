      "summary": "This is a well-structured and comprehensive overview of rollup security mechanisms that successfully synthesizes complex technical concepts for a broad audience. While the manuscript demonstrates strong technical accuracy and excellent clarity, it lacks depth in several critical security areas specified in the review focus, particularly around bridge contract vulnerabilities and withdrawal mechanism security analysis.",

        "Practical and actionable security evaluation framework in Section 6 that provides genuine utility for practitioners assessing rollup deployments",
        "Good use of comparative tables and code examples to illustrate technical concepts, particularly the interactive fraud proof bisection protocol"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Bridge contract vulnerability analysis is superficial - references external bridge hacks (Ronin, Wormhole, Nomad) but fails to deeply analyze canonical rollup bridge-specific vulnerabilities such as message replay attacks, cross-layer reentrancy, or state root manipulation vectors",
        "Withdrawal mechanism security analysis lacks rigor - the challenge period discussion doesn't adequately address withdrawal delay attacks, liquidity provider risks, or the security implications of fast withdrawal services that bypass challenge periods",
        "Emergency intervention mechanisms and upgrade governance risks are mentioned but not systematically analyzed - missing threat models for security council key compromise, timelock bypass scenarios, and the tension between emergency response capability and decentralization"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Expand Section 4.3 to include detailed analysis of canonical bridge vulnerabilities specific to rollups, including cross-layer message verification edge cases, deposit/withdrawal race conditions, and the security implications of L1-L2 state synchronization delays",
        "Add a dedicated subsection analyzing withdrawal mechanism attack vectors including: griefing attacks on challenge periods, economic attacks on liquidity providers offering fast withdrawals, and the security assumptions underlying withdrawal proof verification",
        "Develop a formal threat model for upgrade governance that addresses: security council operational security requirements, attack scenarios involving compromised council members, and quantitative analysis of timelock adequacy under different adversarial assumptions"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "The manuscript provides a solid foundation for understanding rollup security but requires significant strengthening in the specific areas of bridge security, withdrawal mechanisms, and upgrade governance that are critical to the practical security of deployed systems. The bridge security section (4.3) correctly identifies the importance of canonical bridges but then pivots to discussing non-rollup bridge hacks without deeply analyzing rollup-specific vulnerabilities. For instance, the cross-layer message verification process deserves detailed scrutiny: how do rollups verify that a deposit message on L1 corresponds to a legitimate deposit transaction? What happens if the sequencer observes a deposit event but the L1 transaction is later reorged? The manuscript should analyze the security of message hashing schemes, the handling of L1 reorgs during the deposit flow, and potential vulnerabilities in the event parsing logic. Similarly, the withdrawal mechanism analysis focuses primarily on challenge period length but neglects critical security considerations such as: the economic security of the challenge game under various stake distributions, the implications of withdrawal batching on individual user security, and the trust assumptions introduced by fast withdrawal providers who effectively become trusted intermediaries. The upgrade governance discussion would benefit from quantitative analysis - for example, what is the minimum safe timelock duration given realistic assumptions about community response time and attacker capabilities? The manuscript references L2Beat's Stages framework but doesn't critically examine whether the Stage 1/2 criteria adequately capture upgrade security risks. Finally, while the manuscript mentions emergency intervention mechanisms, it doesn't analyze the fundamental tension between having effective emergency response capabilities and achieving meaningful decentralization - this deserves a dedicated threat model analysis.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a security analysis perspective, this manuscript serves as a useful survey but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive security analysis. The treatment of validity proofs is particularly concerning\u2014while the paper correctly identifies that ZK-rollups provide 'computational soundness,' it never formally defines what this means in terms of security reductions or concrete security parameters. For instance, when discussing SNARK-based systems, the paper should specify that soundness relies on assumptions like the Knowledge of Exponent Assumption (KEA) or the Algebraic Group Model, and discuss the implications of these assumptions being falsified. The fraud proof analysis similarly lacks depth: the bisection protocol is described procedurally but without analysis of its security properties under adversarial conditions. Key questions remain unaddressed: What happens if the challenger runs out of gas? How does the protocol handle situations where both parties are malicious? What are the exact conditions under which the 1-of-N assumption provides security, and what network synchrony assumptions are required? The paper mentions that 'periods shorter than 5 days may be insufficient' citing Kelkar et al., but this citation appears misattributed (the referenced paper is about order-fairness, not challenge period analysis). The circuit security section identifies important concerns but lacks formal treatment\u2014what does it mean for a circuit to have a 'soundness bug'? This should be formalized in terms of the constraint system admitting satisfying witnesses for invalid statements. Finally, the prover/verifier complexity discussion needs substantial expansion: the security implications of centralized proving extend beyond liveness and censorship to include potential for undetectable proof manipulation if the prover has implementation-level vulnerabilities that aren't caught by the verification circuit.",

        "Data availability sampling (DAS) treatment is superficial\u2014the manuscript mentions EIP-4844 and alternative DA layers but fails to analyze the cryptographic guarantees of DAS, erasure coding schemes, or the specific security assumptions underlying data availability sampling in proto-danksharding",

      "suggestions": [
        "Expand Section 4.2 to include formal treatment of data availability sampling: analyze the 2D Reed-Solomon erasure coding in danksharding, derive the security bounds for DAS with specific assumptions about honest node participation, and discuss the implications of blob pruning after ~18 days for long-term data retrievability",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "The manuscript demonstrates solid foundational knowledge of rollup architectures but falls short of the rigor expected for a comprehensive security analysis. Regarding data availability, the treatment of EIP-4844 is particularly thin\u2014while blob transactions are mentioned, there's no discussion of how data availability sampling actually works, what the honest minority assumptions are, or how the 18-day pruning window interacts with the 7-day challenge period for optimistic rollups. This is a critical gap since DA is fundamental to rollup security. The claim that 'Security = min(Ethereum, DA layer security)' for external DA is an oversimplification that ignores the nuanced ways these security guarantees compose.\n\nOn sequencer centralization, the manuscript correctly identifies the risks but provides no formal analysis. What is the expected value of MEV extraction for a malicious sequencer? Under what conditions would a sequencer rationally choose to censor transactions? How do force-inclusion delays interact with time-sensitive DeFi operations? These questions require game-theoretic modeling that is absent from the current work.\n\nThe L1-L2 security inheritance discussion is perhaps the weakest aspect. The manuscript assumes that posting data and proofs to L1 automatically confers L1-level security, but this ignores several subtleties: (1) L1 reorgs can invalidate rollup state that users believed was final, (2) the security of validity proofs depends on cryptographic assumptions that are independent of L1 consensus security, (3) bridge security depends on correct implementation of verification logic, not just L1 finality. A rigorous treatment would define a formal security model specifying exactly which L1 properties are inherited and under what assumptions.\n\nThe references, while appropriate, are somewhat dated and miss recent academic work on rollup security formalization. The practical evaluation framework is useful but would benefit from connection to formal verification efforts and existing security audit methodologies. Overall, this is a competent survey that would benefit significantly from deeper analytical treatment of its core claims.",

    "meta_review": "The three reviewers converge on a consistent assessment of this manuscript: it is a well-organized, clearly written survey of rollup security mechanisms that provides genuine value for practitioners, but it falls short of the analytical rigor expected for a top-tier venue. All reviewers praised the comprehensive taxonomy, clear presentation, and practical utility of the security evaluation framework. However, they unanimously identified a pattern of superficial treatment where deeper analysis is warranted\u2014the manuscript describes security mechanisms but often fails to formally analyze them.\n\nThe most significant concerns center on three areas. First, the cryptographic and formal foundations are underdeveloped: security properties are stated without formal definitions, security games, or reduction arguments. Second, critical security-relevant topics receive inadequate depth, including bridge contract vulnerabilities, withdrawal mechanism attacks, data availability sampling guarantees, and sequencer centralization risks. Third, the claimed L1-L2 security inheritance is asserted rather than rigorously defined and proven. The novelty scores (5-6 across reviewers) also indicate that the manuscript synthesizes existing knowledge without contributing new theoretical insights or empirical findings.\n\nDespite these limitations, the reviewers recognize the manuscript's potential value as a comprehensive reference. The issues identified are addressable through revision, though the scope of required changes is substantial. The authors must significantly deepen the analytical treatment of multiple sections rather than simply adding surface-level content.",

    "recommendation": "This manuscript has a solid foundation but requires substantial deepening of its analytical content to meet publication standards. The authors should focus on transforming descriptive content into rigorous analysis: replace qualitative statements with formal definitions, add security games and proofs where security properties are claimed, and provide quantitative analysis of risks that are currently only described qualitatively. Consider whether the scope should be narrowed to allow deeper treatment of fewer topics, or whether the manuscript should be positioned explicitly as a practitioner-oriented survey (which would require different framing and potentially a different venue). The reviewers see clear potential, but the current version reads more as a technical tutorial than a research contribution with novel analytical depth.",
