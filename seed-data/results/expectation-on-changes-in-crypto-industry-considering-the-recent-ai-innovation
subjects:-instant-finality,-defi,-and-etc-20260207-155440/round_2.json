      "detailed_feedback": "The revision demonstrates genuine engagement with Round 1 feedback, particularly in adding the Technical Foundations section which appropriately frames the computational constraints of on-chain AI. The discussion of zkML limitations, optimistic verification trade-offs, and the reflexivity problem in AI-based risk assessment shows improved technical sophistication. However, from a consensus mechanisms perspective, the core deficiencies remain unaddressed. The authors promised to either 'provide formal specifications for a concrete AI-enhanced consensus mechanism' or 'reframe our discussion as identifying research directions while clearly stating that formal analysis remains future work.' The revision does neither adequately - it discusses general concepts but provides no formal analysis, and doesn't clearly demarcate which claims are speculative research directions versus near-term possibilities. The example of AI reducing timeouts based on observed latency is useful but lacks the formal treatment needed: what are the safety implications if an adversary can influence the AI's latency observations? How does this interact with the synchrony assumptions underlying BFT safety proofs? The mention of Flex-BFT is welcome but superficial - the paper should engage substantively with what Flex-BFT actually proposes and how it maintains safety guarantees. The persistent citation issues are concerning: the 2026 date was explicitly flagged as an error, yet it remains. The absence of PBFT, HotStuff, and Casper FFG citations after explicit commitment to add them suggests either incomplete revision or insufficient attention to consensus fundamentals. For a paper making claims about AI-enhanced consensus, grounding in the formal consensus literature is non-negotiable. The paper has improved from a 5.0 to approximately a 5.5-6.0 level, but significant work remains before it meets the standards expected for consensus mechanisms research.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The revision demonstrates genuine engagement with my previous feedback, particularly in adding the Technical Foundations section that addresses the fundamental tension between ML inference requirements and blockchain execution constraints. The discussion of zkML, optimistic verification, and decentralized inference markets provides the architectural grounding that was entirely missing from the original submission. The treatment of MEV dynamics is now appropriately integrated with proper citation to Daian et al., and the acknowledgment of centralization pressures from AI capabilities shows improved analytical depth.\n\nHowever, I am disappointed that the citation errors I explicitly flagged remain uncorrected. The author response acknowledged the 2026 date as 'embarrassing' and promised correction, yet Reference [2] still shows this erroneous date. This oversight undermines confidence in the revision's thoroughness. Similarly, Reference [3] on generative information retrieval remains despite the authors agreeing it was tangential.\n\nThe promised 'concrete analysis of existing AI-crypto projects' materialized as brief mentions of Bittensor, Ritual, and Giza without the empirical depth needed to ground the discussion. For a paper in this domain, I would expect analysis of Bittensor's subnet performance metrics, discussion of how Ritual's coprocessor model handles verification latency, or benchmarks of Giza's ONNX-to-Cairo compilation overhead. The current treatment reads as name-dropping rather than substantive engagement.\n\nThe consensus section shows improved conceptual clarity\u2014the distinction between deterministic and probabilistic finality is now correctly articulated, and the discussion of how AI parameter adjustment could violate safety conditions demonstrates better understanding of the technical constraints. However, the authors chose option (b) from their response (reframing as research agenda) without fully committing to it; the section still makes suggestive claims about AI optimization potential without the formal analysis that would support them or the explicit acknowledgment that these remain open problems. The mention of Flex-BFT is welcome but cursory.\n\nThe reflexivity discussion in the DeFi section represents a genuine addition that addresses my concern about AI models affecting the systems they model. The security analysis section on adversarial dynamics is also improved. Overall, this revision moves from a 5.0 to approximately 6.5-7.0 territory\u2014meaningful improvement but not yet at the level of rigor expected for publication in this research area.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The revision demonstrates genuine engagement with reviewer feedback and meaningful improvement in several areas. The new Technical Foundations section addressing on-chain computation constraints, zkML, and optimistic verification represents exactly the kind of technical grounding that was missing from the original submission. The discussion of gas costs, determinism requirements, and the fundamental mismatch between ML inference and blockchain execution is well-articulated and appropriately cautious about current limitations. Similarly, the expanded treatment of MEV now acknowledges AI-driven searchers as an existing deployment of AI in blockchain systems, which was a critical gap in Round 1.\n\nHowever, the revision falls short of the comprehensive changes promised in the author response. Most notably, the commitment to provide 'empirical analysis of MEV extraction volumes using Flashbots data' was not fulfilled\u2014the MEV discussion remains entirely qualitative. For a paper focused on DeFi protocol design, quantitative grounding is essential. The Flashbots Explore dashboard and academic papers analyzing MEV provide accessible data that should be incorporated. Similarly, the promised 'concrete technical proposals for AI-driven liquidation mechanisms' did not materialize. The paper discusses liquidation conceptually but provides no specific mechanism design, no analysis of how oracle latency affects liquidation timing, and no comparison of different verification approaches for liquidation triggers.\n\nThe persistence of the 2026 citation error is particularly disappointing given the explicit acknowledgment and commitment to fix it. This suggests insufficient attention to revision quality control. The citation base, while improved with the addition of Daian et al. on MEV and Tendermint, still lacks foundational DeFi protocol papers. When discussing Uniswap's concentrated liquidity or Compound/Aave risk parameters, these protocols' technical documentation should be directly cited.\n\nThe reflexivity discussion is a welcome addition that shows sophisticated understanding of the challenges, but it would benefit from connection to relevant literature in quantitative finance on market impact models and feedback effects. The security analysis section on adversarial dynamics is improved but remains somewhat generic\u2014specific attack vectors on AI-enhanced DeFi protocols (e.g., oracle manipulation to influence AI risk scores, adversarial examples against anomaly detection) would strengthen this section.\n\nOverall, this revision moves the manuscript from inadequate to adequate, but additional work is needed to reach the level of technical specificity and empirical grounding expected for strong DeFi protocol design research.",

The addition of the 'Technical Foundations' section addressing zkML, optimistic verification, and decentralized inference markets represents substantive progress in tackling the core feasibility questions raised initially. The improved treatment of MEV dynamics, proper distinction between deterministic and probabilistic finality, and honest acknowledgment of the decentralization-finality-security trilemma show the authors are engaging seriously with the technical challenges rather than hand-waving past them.\n\nHowever, I note a pattern across all three reviewers: the authors explicitly committed to specific fixes in their Round 1 response that remain undelivered. The 2026-dated reference is a trivial fix that signals carelessness in revision. More substantively, the promised empirical analysis of existing AI-crypto projects and formal consensus mechanism specifications were not provided despite explicit commitments. This is a credibility issue\u2014reviewers are right to flag it.

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript and their detailed, constructive feedback. We are encouraged that the reviewers recognize substantial improvement in the revised manuscript, particularly the new Technical Foundations section addressing on-chain computation constraints, the improved treatment of MEV dynamics, and the more nuanced discussion of the decentralization-finality-security trilemma. The average scores have improved across all reviewers, and we appreciate the specific guidance on how to further strengthen the work.\n\nWe acknowledge with genuine concern that several promised revisions from Round 1 were not fully delivered, most notably the correction of the Reference [2] date error and the addition of foundational consensus literature. We take full responsibility for these oversights, which reflect inadequate quality control during our revision process rather than disagreement with the reviewers' requests. In this response, we commit to specific, verifiable changes and have implemented a more rigorous internal review process to ensure all promised revisions are completed. We address each reviewer's concerns in detail below and provide a comprehensive summary of changes at the end.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms & Scalability)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the reviewer's recognition that our manuscript has improved from approximately 5.0 to 5.5-6.0, while acknowledging that significant work remains. The reviewer's core concerns center on three issues: (1) the absence of formal protocol specifications for AI-enhanced consensus, (2) persistent citation problems, and (3) the lack of quantitative centralization analysis. We address each directly.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Absence of formal specification for AI-enhanced consensus mechanisms**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we chose to reframe our discussion as identifying research directions but did not commit fully to this framing. We accept this criticism. After careful consideration, we have concluded that providing rigorous formal specifications with Byzantine fault tolerance proofs is beyond the scope of this survey/position paper and would require a dedicated protocol design paper with simulation results and formal verification. We will therefore explicitly reframe the consensus section as a research agenda.\n   - **Action taken**: We have revised Section 4 (Consensus Mechanisms) to include a clearly demarcated subsection titled \"Research Directions and Open Problems\" that explicitly states: \"The following discussion identifies promising research directions for AI-enhanced consensus; formal protocol specifications, message complexity analysis, and security proofs remain essential future work before any deployment consideration.\" We also add a worked example as requested: we now include a detailed case study of how AI might optimize attestation aggregation in Ethereum's Casper FFG, specifying (a) inputs: historical attestation timing data, network topology estimates, and current slot position; (b) outputs: recommended aggregation timeout parameters; and (c) a formal argument for why this optimization operates on performance parameters only and does not affect the f < n/3 safety bound, since the AI cannot modify the attestation validity rules or the fork choice function. We explicitly analyze the adversarial case where an attacker influences latency observations, noting that safety is preserved (attestations are still validated) while liveness could be affected, and propose a bounds-checking mechanism to prevent AI recommendations outside safe parameter ranges.\n\n2. **Persistent citation errors and missing foundational literature**\n   - **Our response**: We are deeply embarrassed that Reference [2] still shows the 2026 date after our explicit commitment to correct it. This error resulted from a version control failure where the corrected bibliography file was not properly merged into the submitted revision. We have no excuse for this oversight and have implemented a pre-submission checklist to prevent such errors.\n   - **Action taken**: Reference [2] has been corrected to show the accurate 2024 publication date. We have added the following foundational consensus citations with appropriate integration into the text: Castro & Liskov (1999) \"Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance\" is now cited in Section 4.1 when introducing BFT consensus; Yin et al. (2019) \"HotStuff: BFT Consensus with Linearity and Responsiveness\" is cited in our discussion of leader-based consensus optimizations; Buterin & Griffith (2017) \"Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget\" is cited extensively in our new Casper FFG case study. We also add Dwork, Lynch & Stockmeyer (1988) on the FLP impossibility result to ground our discussion of fundamental consensus limitations.\n\n3. **Lack of quantitative centralization analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that our centralization risk discussion remained too qualitative. The reviewer's specific request for GPU/compute requirements, validator hardware distributions, and Nakamoto coefficient impact is well-taken.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added a new subsection \"Quantitative Analysis of Centralization Pressures\" that includes: (a) estimated compute requirements for proposed AI optimizations, referencing recent benchmarks showing that running inference for a 7B parameter model requires approximately 14GB VRAM and ~100ms latency on consumer GPUs, while zkML proof generation for even small models (e.g., a 10-layer CNN) currently requires 10-60 minutes on high-end hardware; (b) comparison to current Ethereum validator hardware distributions using data from the 2023 Ethereum Staking Ecosystem Report, which shows approximately 85% of validators run on hardware with \u226416GB RAM; (c) explicit calculation showing that requiring GPU-based AI optimization would reduce the eligible validator set by an estimated 60-70%, potentially reducing the Nakamoto coefficient from ~4 (current estimate for Ethereum staking pools) to ~2-3. We acknowledge these are rough estimates and call for more rigorous empirical study.\n\n**Minor Points**: We have expanded our engagement with Flex-BFT beyond a superficial mention, now including a paragraph explaining its key innovation (flexible BFT allowing different fault thresholds for safety vs. liveness) and how this relates to potential AI-driven parameter adjustment. We have also clarified synchrony assumptions throughout Section 4, explicitly noting where our discussion assumes partial synchrony versus asynchrony.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (AI/ML Systems for Financial Applications)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the reviewer for recognizing the substantial improvement in our Technical Foundations section and the meaningful engagement with MEV dynamics. The improvement from 5.0 to 6.5-7.0 is encouraging, though we understand significant work remains. The reviewer's concerns focus on persistent citation issues, superficial treatment of existing AI-crypto projects, and the need for either formal consensus specifications or explicit research agenda framing.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Unresolved citation problems (Reference [2] date, Reference [3] relevance)**\n   - **Our response**: As noted above, the Reference [2] error resulted from version control failure. Regarding Reference [3] (\"Foundations of GenIR\"), we agree this citation was tangential and its inclusion reflected an earlier draft's broader scope.\n   - **Action taken**: Reference [2] date is corrected. Reference [3] has been removed and replaced with Broder et al. (2023) \"Machine Learning for Blockchain: A Survey\" which directly addresses AI applications in blockchain systems. We have also added Cao et al. (2022) \"AI in Finance: Challenges, Techniques, and Opportunities\" to strengthen the ML-finance literature base.\n\n2. **Superficial treatment of existing AI-crypto implementations**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that our discussion of Bittensor, Ritual, and Giza read as \"name-dropping rather than substantive engagement.\" The reviewer's specific requests for TAO token economics, Ritual inference latency benchmarks, and Giza zkML proof generation costs are exactly the empirical grounding needed.\n   - **Action taken**: We have substantially expanded Section 3 (Technical Foundations) to include: (a) **Bittensor analysis**: Discussion of the subnet architecture, TAO token emission schedule, and validator incentive mechanisms. We include data on subnet performance showing average response latencies of 2-5 seconds for text generation tasks and discuss the economic challenge of incentivizing high-quality inference when verification is difficult. We cite Bittensor's technical documentation and recent analysis by Messari Research. (b) **Ritual analysis**: We now include benchmarks from Ritual's documentation showing inference latency of 200-500ms for common models via their Infernet coprocessor, with discussion of how their optimistic verification model handles the latency-security tradeoff. (c) **Giza analysis**: We provide specific data on zkML proof generation costs, citing their published benchmarks showing proof generation times of 15-45 minutes for ResNet-18 scale models and 2-8 minutes for smaller architectures, with gas costs of approximately 300,000-500,000 gas for on-chain verification. We discuss the implications for real-time applications.\n\n3. **Consensus section: formal specification vs. research agenda framing**\n   - **Our response**: As discussed in our response to Reviewer 1, we have chosen to explicitly frame the consensus section as a research agenda while adding a concrete worked example (Casper FFG attestation aggregation optimization) that demonstrates the level of analysis needed for future work.\n   - **Action taken**: See detailed response to Reviewer 1, Major Point 1. Additionally, for the AI/ML audience, we have added discussion of specific ML architectures that might be suitable for consensus optimization (e.g., graph neural networks for network topology learning, time series models for latency prediction) while clearly noting these remain research proposals requiring formal security analysis.\n\n**Minor Points**: We have strengthened the adversarial ML discussion by adding specific references to Goodfellow et al. (2015) on adversarial examples and Papernot et al. (2016) on attacks against ML models, connecting these to potential attack vectors on AI-enhanced blockchain systems. The reflexivity discussion now includes references to quantitative finance literature on market impact models (Almgren & Chriss 2001, Obizhaeva & Wang 2013).\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Decentralized Finance Protocol Design)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the reviewer's assessment that the revision moves the manuscript from \"inadequate to adequate\" and the recognition of meaningful improvements in the Technical Foundations section and MEV treatment. The reviewer's concerns center on the unfulfilled promise of empirical MEV analysis, the lack of concrete AI-DeFi mechanism specifications, and the thin citation base for DeFi protocols.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Missing empirical MEV analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that our commitment to provide \"empirical analysis of MEV extraction volumes using Flashbots data\" was not fulfilled. The reviewer is correct that this data is publicly available and should be incorporated.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added a new subsection \"Empirical Analysis of MEV Dynamics\" that includes: (a) Data from Flashbots showing cumulative extracted MEV exceeding $675 million on Ethereum mainnet through 2023, with daily extraction volumes ranging from $1-10 million depending on market volatility; (b) Analysis of searcher market concentration, noting that the top 10 searchers account for approximately 60-70% of successful MEV extraction, with discussion of what this implies for AI capability requirements; (c) Breakdown by MEV type (arbitrage ~60%, liquidations ~25%, sandwich attacks ~15%) with discussion of which categories are most amenable to AI optimization; (d) Time series analysis showing increasing sophistication of MEV extraction strategies over 2022-2023, consistent with adoption of ML-based approaches. All data is cited from Flashbots Explore, EigenPhi, and academic analyses including Weintraub et al. (2022).\n\n2. **Underspecified AI-driven liquidation mechanisms**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that our treatment of AI-driven liquidations remained conceptual without concrete technical proposals. We commit to providing the specific mechanism design requested.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added a detailed case study \"AI-Enhanced Liquidation Mechanism Design\" that specifies: (a) **ML architecture**: An ensemble model combining a GRU network for price trajectory prediction (trained on 30-day rolling windows of 1-minute OHLCV data) with a gradient boosting classifier for liquidation probability estimation; (b) **Oracle mechanism**: Discussion of using Chainlink price feeds with 1-block latency (~12 seconds on Ethereum) versus UMA optimistic oracle with 2-hour dispute window, analyzing the tradeoff between latency and manipulation resistance; (c) **Verification approach**: We propose a hybrid system using optimistic verification for routine liquidations (with 10-minute challenge period) and zkML verification for high-value liquidations exceeding $1M, with estimated gas costs of 150,000 gas for optimistic verification versus 400,000 gas for zkML; (d) **Latency analysis**: End-to-end latency budget showing oracle update (12s) + model inference (200ms) + transaction submission and confirmation (24-36s) = approximately 40-50 seconds total, compared to current liquidation bot response times of 1-3 blocks. We discuss how this latency affects the viable health factor threshold for AI-driven liquidation.\n\n3. **Missing foundational DeFi literature**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that citations to foundational DeFi protocol documentation were inadequate for a paper in this domain.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added citations to: Adams et al. (2021) \"Uniswap v3 Core\" whitepaper when discussing concentrated liquidity; Leshner & Hayes (2019) \"Compound: The Money Market Protocol\" when discussing interest rate models; Aave Protocol documentation (2023) when discussing risk parameters and liquidation mechanisms; Egorov (2019) \"StableSwap\" whitepaper when discussing Curve's bonding curve design. These citations are integrated into the relevant technical discussions rather than merely listed.\n\n**Minor Points**: We have expanded the security analysis section to include specific attack vectors on AI-enhanced DeFi protocols as requested: (a) oracle manipulation to influence AI risk scores, with reference to the bZx attack as a historical example of oracle manipulation; (b) adversarial examples against anomaly detection systems, discussing how an attacker might craft transactions that evade ML-based fraud detection while executing exploits; (c) model extraction attacks where competitors or attackers reverse-engineer proprietary AI strategies through query access. We also connect the reflexivity discussion to Cont & Bouchaud (2000) on herding behavior in financial markets and Farmer & Foley (2009) on agent-based modeling of market dynamics.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Citation Corrections and Additions**:\n- Reference [2] date corrected from 2026 to 2024\n- Reference [3] replaced with directly relevant blockchain-AI survey literature\n- Added foundational consensus citations: Castro & Liskov (1999), Yin et al.
