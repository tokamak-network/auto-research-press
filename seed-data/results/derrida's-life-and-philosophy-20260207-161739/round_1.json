      "detailed_feedback": "As a general review, this manuscript demonstrates competent expository writing about a notoriously difficult philosopher, and the author shows genuine understanding of deconstruction's core insights. The connection between Derrida's Algerian Jewish background and his philosophical preoccupations with marginality is handled sensitively. However, the paper cannot be considered publication-ready in its current state due to fundamental scholarly deficiencies. The proliferation of '[citation needed]' markers is unacceptable for any academic submission\u2014these represent not minor gaps but the absence of basic documentation for nearly every factual and interpretive claim. The three citations that do appear are problematic: while Maleuvre's piece on 'Monolingualism of the Other' is relevant, the Schneider reference on extraterrestrial life appears to be included artificially, perhaps to meet some citation requirement, but it contributes nothing substantive to understanding Derrida. The paper would benefit enormously from direct engagement with Derrida's texts\u2014quotations, close readings, specific page references\u2014rather than paraphrasing concepts at a distance. Additionally, the treatment of Derrida's critics is somewhat superficial; engaging with specific objections from Searle, Habermas, or analytic philosophers would strengthen the critical dimension. The contemporary relevance section gestures toward interesting connections with digital technology but remains underdeveloped. For a short paper, narrowing focus to one aspect of Derrida's thought\u2014perhaps the supplement or diff\u00e9rance\u2014and treating it with greater depth and proper documentation would be preferable to this broad but inadequately supported survey.",

The absence of direct citations from Derrida's works is particularly problematic when discussing specific concepts like diff\u00e9rance or the supplement\u2014these discussions should reference the relevant passages from 'Of Grammatology' or 'Margins of Philosophy.' The inclusion of Schneider's paper on extraterrestrial life as reference [4] is puzzling and undermines the paper's credibility; the analogy drawn is superficial and does not illuminate Derrida's project in any substantive way. The paper would benefit from engaging with the substantial body of Derrida scholarship, including works by Gayatri Spivak (whose translator's introduction to 'Of Grammatology' remains essential), Simon Critchley on ethics, or Martin H\u00e4gglund's 'Radical Atheism' for more recent interpretations. The discussion of the Cambridge controversy and critical reception is accurate but would be strengthened by specific references to the published exchanges. Finally, while the paper is well-written, it reads more as an encyclopedia entry than a scholarly contribution\u2014there is no clear argumentative throughline or original interpretive claim that would justify publication in its current form.",

The most pressing issue is the citation apparatus: a research paper on a major philosopher cannot rely on three references, especially when two are only marginally relevant. The Maleuvre piece on 'Monolingualism of the Other' is appropriately cited, but the paper desperately needs direct engagement with Derrida's primary texts and with the substantial body of Derrida scholarship. Works by Spivak, Bennington, Gasch\u00e9, Norris, and Culler are standard references that should inform any serious treatment of this subject. The comparison to debates about defining extraterrestrial life (reference [4]) is strained and adds little analytical value\u2014it appears to be an attempt to create interdisciplinary resonance that ultimately distracts from the philosophical substance. Substantively, the paper accurately presents key concepts but occasionally oversimplifies; for instance, the treatment of the speech/writing hierarchy could more carefully distinguish Derrida's position from a simple inversion. The discussion of the Cambridge controversy is interesting but lacks citation to the actual documents involved. The paper's greatest weakness is its lack of a distinctive scholarly contribution\u2014it synthesizes existing knowledge competently but does not advance any new interpretation or argument. For a short paper, this could be remedied by narrowing the focus considerably and developing a specific thesis about some aspect of Derrida's thought rather than attempting comprehensive coverage.",

    "meta_review": "All three reviewers converge on remarkably consistent assessments, which strengthens my confidence in their calibration. The manuscript succeeds as clear, accessible philosophical exposition\u2014reviewers uniformly praise its prose quality, logical organization, and competent synthesis of Derrida's key concepts. However, the weaknesses identified are not mere nitpicking but represent fundamental scholarly deficiencies: approximately 15-20 '[citation needed]' placeholders indicate an incomplete manuscript, the absence of any primary Derrida texts is a serious omission for a paper purporting to discuss his philosophy, and the inclusion of a tangential reference on extraterrestrial life (Schneider) appears forced and undermines credibility.\n\nThe reviewers are applying appropriate standards for a humanities research publication. Their demand for primary source engagement and proper citation apparatus is not excessive\u2014it is the baseline expectation for any scholarly work on a major philosopher. The criticism that the paper reads as 'an encyclopedia entry rather than a research manuscript' is substantive and valid. A research publication requires either original argument, novel interpretation, or at minimum, rigorous engagement with the scholarly conversation. Currently, this manuscript offers competent summary without scholarly contribution.\n\nGiven this is Round 1 of 2, major revision is appropriate and realistic. The core writing quality and conceptual understanding are solid foundations. The required changes\u2014completing citations, engaging primary texts, developing a thesis\u2014are substantial but achievable for an author who clearly understands the material. The path to acceptance is clear: transform this from an informative overview into a genuine scholarly contribution with proper apparatus and argumentative focus.",

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their constructive feedback. The reviewers have provided remarkably consistent assessments, which helps us identify clear priorities for revision. We are grateful for the recognition of the paper's strengths\u2014particularly its accessible prose, logical organization, and thoughtful integration of biographical context with philosophical development.\n\nThe reviewers have converged on three critical concerns: (1) the severely inadequate citation apparatus, including numerous '[citation needed]' placeholders and absence of primary Derrida texts; (2) the problematic inclusion of the Schneider reference on extraterrestrial life; and (3) the lack of a distinctive argumentative thesis or novel scholarly contribution. We accept these criticisms as valid and substantive. Our revision strategy will prioritize comprehensive citation remediation, removal of the tangential Schneider reference, and restructuring the paper around a more focused argumentative claim. We appreciate the reviewers' specific suggestions for secondary sources and their guidance toward a more rigorous scholarly contribution.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Expert 1)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Expert 1 for their balanced evaluation (average 5.5/10) and appreciate their recognition of the paper's clarity and organizational strengths while identifying fundamental scholarly deficiencies that require immediate attention.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Critically inadequate citation apparatus with '[citation needed]' placeholders**\n   - **Our response**: We fully acknowledge this serious deficiency. The submission of a manuscript with placeholder citations was a significant oversight that falls below acceptable scholarly standards. We understand this undermines the credibility of every factual and interpretive claim in the paper.\n   - **Action taken**: We will replace all '[citation needed]' placeholders with proper references. Specifically, we will add direct citations to *Of Grammatology* (1967/1976), *Writing and Difference* (1967/1978), *Speech and Phenomena* (1967/1973), and *Margins of Philosophy* (1972/1982). We will also incorporate key secondary sources including Spivak's translator's introduction, Gasch\u00e9's *The Tain of the Mirror*, Bennington and Derrida's *Jacques Derrida*, and Norris's *Derrida*.\n\n2. **Tangential references (Long on liturgy, Schneider on extraterrestrial life)**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. The Schneider reference was included to suggest interdisciplinary resonance regarding definitional instability, but we recognize this parallel is strained and detracts from rather than enhances the philosophical analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: We will remove the Schneider reference entirely. The Long reference on liturgy will be evaluated for relevance; if the connection to Derrida's work on religion and the messianic is not sufficiently developed, it will also be removed or replaced with more directly relevant scholarship (e.g., Caputo's *The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida*).\n\n3. **Lack of argumentative thesis or novel contribution**\n   - **Our response**: We appreciate this important critique. The reviewer correctly identifies that the paper reads as an encyclopedia entry rather than a research contribution.\n   - **Action taken**: We will restructure the paper around a focused thesis examining the relationship between Derrida's biographical experience of marginality (as an Algerian Jew under Vichy laws) and the development of his theoretical apparatus for analyzing exclusion and the logic of the supplement. This will transform the biographical material from context into evidence for an interpretive argument.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will address the reviewer's observation about oversimplification of the speech/writing hierarchy by more carefully articulating that Derrida's project involves neither simple inversion nor neutralization but rather a demonstration of how the hierarchical opposition is always already contaminated. We will also add citations to the published documents from the Cambridge controversy.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Expert 2)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Expert 2 for their thorough evaluation (average 5.5/10) and their constructive suggestions for improving the manuscript's scholarly apparatus and argumentative focus.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Severe citation deficiencies and absence of primary source engagement**\n   - **Our response**: We agree completely. A paper discussing specific concepts like *diff\u00e9rance* and the supplement without direct textual engagement fails to meet basic scholarly standards.\n   - **Action taken**: We will incorporate direct quotations and close readings of key passages, including Derrida's explanation of *diff\u00e9rance* in \"Diff\u00e9rance\" (from *Margins of Philosophy*), the analysis of the supplement in Part II of *Of Grammatology*, and the discussion of iterability in \"Signature Event Context.\" Page references will accompany all textual discussions.\n\n2. **Problematic Schneider reference**\n   - **Our response**: We concur that this reference is \"puzzling\" and \"undermines the paper's credibility.\" The attempted analogy does not illuminate Derrida's project substantively.\n   - **Action taken**: This reference will be removed in the revised manuscript.\n\n3. **No original argument or contribution to Derrida scholarship**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism and appreciate the reviewer's specific suggestions for developing originality.\n   - **Action taken**: Following the reviewer's guidance, we will develop a sustained analysis focusing on how Derrida's concept of the supplement (as articulated in his reading of Rousseau) provides resources for understanding contemporary debates about identity, authenticity, and technological mediation. This will engage with more recent scholarship including H\u00e4gglund's *Radical Atheism* to position our argument within current interpretive conversations.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will add references to Spivak's translator's introduction, Critchley's work on Derrida and ethics, and the published Searle-Derrida exchange in *Limited Inc* to strengthen our discussion of critical reception. The contemporary relevance section will be either substantially developed with proper citations or condensed to avoid underdeveloped gestures.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Expert 3)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank Expert 3 for their detailed feedback (average 5.5/10) and particularly appreciate their recognition of the paper's handling of Derrida's colonial experience and the accessibility of its prose.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Critical citation failures and absence of primary Derrida texts**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. The reviewer is correct that approximately 20 '[citation needed]' placeholders represent \"not minor gaps but the absence of basic documentation.\"\n   - **Action taken**: Complete citation remediation as detailed above. We will ensure that every factual claim about Derrida's biography is supported by reference to established biographies (Peeters's *Derrida: A Biography*; Powell's *Jacques Derrida: A Biography*), and every interpretive claim is grounded in primary texts or acknowledged secondary scholarship.\n\n2. **Forced Schneider reference**\n   - **Our response**: We agree this \"appears to be an artificial connection that weakens rather than strengthens the argument.\"\n   - **Action taken**: The reference will be removed entirely.\n\n3. **Superficial treatment of critics and underdeveloped contemporary relevance**\n   - **Our response**: We appreciate this specific feedback. The current treatment of critical reception lacks the depth necessary for scholarly contribution.\n   - **Action taken**: We will engage specifically with Searle's objections in \"Reiterating the Differences\" and Derrida's response in *Limited Inc*, as well as Habermas's critique in *The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity*. The contemporary relevance section will either be developed with substantive analysis of specific applications (e.g., Stiegler's technics, Butler's performativity theory) or removed to allow for deeper treatment of core concepts.\n\n**Minor Points**: We appreciate the suggestion to narrow focus to one aspect of Derrida's thought. Given the paper's existing strength in connecting biography to philosophy, we will focus on the supplement and its relationship to Derrida's experience of exclusion, treating this with \"greater depth and proper documentation\" as the reviewer recommends.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Revisions Planned**:\n- Complete replacement of all '[citation needed]' placeholders with proper references to primary and secondary sources\n- Addition of direct citations to Derrida's major works: *Of Grammatology*, *Writing and Difference*, *Speech and Phenomena*, *Margins of Philosophy*, and *Limited Inc*\n- Incorporation of canonical secondary sources: Spivak, Gasch\u00e9, Bennington, Norris, Culler, and Caputo\n- Removal of the Schneider reference on extraterrestrial life\n- Development of a focused argumentative thesis connecting Derrida's biographical experience of marginality to his theoretical apparatus of the supplement\n- Substantive engagement with specific critics (Searle, Habermas) with proper citations\n\n**Structural Changes**:\n- Narrowing the paper's scope from comprehensive survey to focused argument\n- Adding close readings of specific passages from Derrida's texts\n- Either substantially developing or removing the underdeveloped contemporary relevance section\n\n**Clarifications**:\n- More careful articulation of Derrida's position on the speech/writing hierarchy\n- Addition of citations to Cambridge controversy documents\n- Engagement with contested interpretive questions in Derrida scholarship\n\nWe are committed to addressing these deficiencies thoroughly and believe the revised manuscript will meet the scholarly standards appropriately expected by the reviewers. We welcome any additional guidance as we undertake these revisions.",
