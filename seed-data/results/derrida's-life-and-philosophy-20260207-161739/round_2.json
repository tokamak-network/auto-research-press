The removal of the Schneider reference and the more developed treatment of the Searle exchange also show responsiveness to criticism. However, the most critical deficiency identified in Round 1\u2014the absence of proper citations to primary Derrida texts\u2014remains essentially unaddressed. The author response explicitly promised to add citations to Of Grammatology, Writing and Difference, Speech and Phenomena, Margins of Philosophy, and Limited Inc, along with secondary sources including Spivak, Gasch\u00e9, Bennington, and Caputo. None of these appear in the References section. The paper discusses these texts substantively but fails to cite them formally, which is a fundamental scholarly lapse. The '[citation needed]' placeholders have been removed, but they have been replaced with uncited claims rather than proper references. For a paper making interpretive arguments about Derrida's philosophy, the absence of any primary source citations is a serious deficiency that must be remedied before publication. The two references that do appear\u2014Maleuvre on Monolingualism of the Other and Long on liturgy\u2014are legitimate but insufficient to support the paper's claims. The Long reference, while more integrated than the previous Schneider citation, still feels somewhat tangential to the main argument about the supplement and exclusion.",

It discusses Speech and Phenomena, Writing and Difference, Margins of Philosophy, and Limited Inc without citing any of them. The Maleuvre reference on Monolingualism of the Other is appropriate but insufficient to support a paper making extensive claims about Derrida's broader corpus. The Long reference on liturgy remains tangentially relevant at best. The argumentative improvement is real\u2014the thesis connecting biographical marginality to the logic of the supplement is genuinely interesting and represents a scholarly contribution rather than mere summary. But a paper cannot make claims about what Derrida 'writes' or 'argues' in specific texts without citing those texts. This is not a matter of scholarly convention but of basic intellectual accountability. The revision has moved from having inadequate citations with placeholders to having inadequate citations without placeholders\u2014which is arguably worse, as it now presents unsupported claims as if they were properly documented. A third revision must prioritize what should have been addressed first: proper engagement with the primary texts that constitute the paper's subject matter.",

The authors have successfully transformed what was an encyclopedic survey into a paper with a clear, defensible thesis connecting Derrida's biographical experience of marginality to his concept of the supplement. The prose quality is consistently praised across all three reviewers, and the structural reorganization demonstrates meaningful engagement with Round 1 feedback. The removal of the tangential Schneider reference and the addition of substantive discussion of the Searle-Derrida exchange show the authors are capable of responsive revision.\n\nHowever, all three reviewers identify the same critical deficiency: the citation apparatus remains inadequate, and crucially, the authors explicitly promised in their response to add primary Derrida texts and canonical secondary sources but failed to deliver on this commitment. This is not nitpicking\u2014a philosophy paper discussing specific passages from Of Grammatology, Margins of Philosophy, and Limited Inc without citing these works represents a genuine scholarly deficiency. The fact that the reference count actually decreased (from 3 to 2) while the authors promised substantial additions is concerning. That said, this is a clearly fixable problem, not a fundamental flaw in the argument or analysis.\n\nGiven this is the final round, I must weigh whether the citation issue is fatal or whether it can be addressed through a targeted minor revision. The intellectual contribution is sound, the argument is coherent, and the writing is strong. The missing citations are a mechanical (if important) fix that does not require reconceptualizing the paper. Demanding another major revision cycle for what amounts to bibliography completion would be disproportionate. A focused minor revision with a strict, bounded scope is the appropriate path forward.",

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe thank all three reviewers for their continued careful engagement with our manuscript and for recognizing the genuine improvements in argumentative focus and coherence achieved in the first revision. We are gratified that reviewers acknowledge the paper now advances \"a clear, defensible thesis about the relationship between Derrida's experience of colonial exclusion and his theoretical development of supplementarity\" (Expert 2) and that the transformation from \"encyclopedic survey\" to \"focused argument\" (Expert 3) represents meaningful progress.\n\nHowever, we must offer an unequivocal apology regarding the citation apparatus. All three reviewers have rightly identified that we failed to implement the most fundamental revision we explicitly promised: the addition of proper citations to primary Derrida texts and canonical secondary scholarship. This failure is inexcusable. We committed to specific additions\u2014Of Grammatology, Margins of Philosophy, Limited Inc, along with secondary sources including Spivak, Gasch\u00e9, and Bennington\u2014and delivered none of them. We take full responsibility for this lapse and will prioritize comprehensive citation revision in this round. The reviewers are correct that a paper making interpretive claims about specific Derrida texts cannot be considered scholarly work without citing those texts, regardless of how well-argued the interpretation may be.\n\n### Response to Expert 3\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We accept Expert 3's scores (Average 6.0/10, with Citations at 4/10) as fair given our failure to deliver on promised revisions. The recognition of improved argumentative focus is appreciated, but we understand that scholarly merit cannot compensate for citation deficiencies.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. *No primary Derrida texts cited despite explicit promises*\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely valid. We have no defense for this failure. The gap between our Round 1 promises and our actual revision is unacceptable.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add the following primary source citations with full bibliographic information:\n     - Derrida, J. (1976). *Of Grammatology* (G. C. Spivak, Trans.). Johns Hopkins University Press. (Original work published 1967)\n     - Derrida, J. (1982). *Margins of Philosophy* (A. Bass, Trans.). University of Chicago Press. (Original work published 1972)\n     - Derrida, J. (1988). *Limited Inc*. Northwestern University Press.\n     - Derrida, J. (1998). *Monolingualism of the Other; or, The Prosthesis of Origin* (P. Mensah, Trans.). Stanford University Press. (Original work published 1996)\n\n2. *Absence of promised secondary sources (Spivak, Gasch\u00e9, Bennington, Caputo, Peeters)*\n   - **Our response**: Again, we accept this criticism without reservation. We will add:\n     - Bennington, G., & Derrida, J. (1993). *Jacques Derrida*. University of Chicago Press.\n     - Gasch\u00e9, R. (1986). *The Tain of the Mirror: Derrida and the Philosophy of Reflection*. Harvard University Press.\n     - Spivak, G. C. (1976). Translator's preface. In J. Derrida, *Of Grammatology* (pp. ix\u2013lxxxvii). Johns Hopkins University Press.\n   - **Action taken**: These sources will be integrated into the discussion of the supplement and diff\u00e9rance, providing scholarly grounding for our interpretive claims.\n\n3. *Missing page references for direct quotations*\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that our quotation about the supplement (\"adds only to replace\") lacks proper citation.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add the page reference (Of Grammatology, pp. 144-145 in the Spivak translation) and ensure all direct quotations include specific page numbers.\n\n**Minor Points**: We appreciate the suggestion regarding the Long reference. We will either develop its connection to Derrida's later ethical turn more explicitly or replace it with Caputo's *The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida* (1997), which more directly addresses the themes of marginality and the messianic that inform our argument.\n\n### Response to Expert 1\n\n**Overall Assessment**: Expert 1's scores (Average 6.0/10, Citations 4/10) accurately reflect the manuscript's current state. We are particularly struck by the observation that the revision \"moved from having inadequate citations with placeholders to having inadequate citations without placeholders\u2014which is arguably worse.\" This is a fair and sobering assessment.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. *Failure to implement promised primary source citations*\n   - **Our response**: Expert 1 correctly identifies the \"frustrating paradox\" of improved argumentation alongside citation failure. We understand that \"a paper cannot make claims about what Derrida 'writes' or 'argues' in specific texts without citing those texts\" and that \"this is not a matter of scholarly convention but of basic intellectual accountability.\"\n   - **Action taken**: As detailed above, we will add complete citations to Of Grammatology, Margins of Philosophy, Limited Inc, and Monolingualism of the Other. We will also add Speech and Phenomena (1973, trans. Allison) for the discussion of presence and voice.\n\n2. *Absence of promised secondary scholarship*\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer notes that our reference count actually decreased from three to two, which is the opposite of what we promised. We will rectify this comprehensively.\n   - **Action taken**: In addition to Bennington, Gasch\u00e9, and Spivak's translator's preface, we will add Peeters's biography *Derrida: A Biography* (2013) to support biographical claims, ensuring these are not presented as unsupported assertions.\n\n3. *Uncited direct quotation from Of Grammatology*\n   - **Our response**: Expert 1 is correct that presenting a direct quotation without citation is a fundamental scholarly lapse.\n   - **Action taken**: The quotation will receive proper citation with page reference. We will review the entire manuscript to ensure no other quotations or specific textual claims lack documentation.\n\n**Minor Points**: We accept the suggestion to either properly cite the Cambridge controversy or acknowledge it as widely documented in secondary literature (we will cite Peeters's account of this episode).\n\n### Response to Expert 2\n\n**Overall Assessment**: Expert 2's scores (Average 6.0/10, Citations 4/10) and characterization of the citation apparatus as \"critically inadequate\" are justified. We appreciate the recognition that \"the paper's argument is now more focused and interesting\" while acknowledging it \"cannot be considered scholarly work without proper documentation.\"\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. *No primary Derrida texts in references despite extensive discussion*\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism fully. Expert 2's observation that \"the gap between the author response's promises and the actual revision is concerning\" is warranted.\n   - **Action taken**: Complete primary source citations as detailed in our response to Expert 3.\n\n2. *Citation count decreased rather than increased*\n   - **Our response**: This is an accurate and damning observation. We committed to expanding our scholarly apparatus and instead contracted it.\n   - **Action taken**: The revised manuscript will include a minimum of 8-10 references: four primary Derrida texts, three canonical secondary sources, and the existing Maleuvre reference (which Expert 2 correctly notes is \"appropriate for the Monolingualism discussion\").\n\n3. *Long reference remains underdeveloped*\n   - **Our response**: We will either develop the connection between Long's liturgical analysis and Derrida's later work on religion, hospitality, and the messianic, or replace it with Caputo's work, which more directly engages the themes of marginality and ethical responsibility central to our argument.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a sentence explicitly connecting liturgical supplementarity to Derrida's arguments in *The Gift of Death* and *Acts of Religion*, or substitute Caputo's *Prayers and Tears* as a more directly relevant secondary source.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will ensure that the discussion of \"Diff\u00e9rance\" properly cites Margins of Philosophy with page references, and that the Searle-Derrida exchange cites both Limited Inc and Searle's original essay \"Reiterating the Differences\" (1977).\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Primary Source Citations to be Added**:\n- Derrida, J. (1973). *Speech and Phenomena* (D. B. Allison, Trans.). Northwestern University Press.\n- Derrida, J. (1976). *Of Grammatology* (G. C. Spivak, Trans.). Johns Hopkins University Press.\n- Derrida, J. (1982). *Margins of Philosophy* (A. Bass, Trans.). University of Chicago Press.\n- Derrida, J. (1988). *Limited Inc*. Northwestern University Press.\n- Derrida, J.

Translator's preface to *Of Grammatology*.\n- Caputo, J. D. (1997). *The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida*. Indiana University Press. (if Long reference is replaced)\n\n**Additional Revisions**:\n- Page references added to all direct quotations\n- Cambridge controversy documented with biographical citation\n- Searle's \"Reiterating the Differences\" cited for completeness of the exchange discussion\n- Long reference either developed with explicit connection to Derrida's religious turn or replaced with Caputo\n\nWe recognize that this response contains promises similar to those we failed to fulfill in Round 1. We understand that reviewers have legitimate reason to be skeptical. We commit to prioritizing citation revision before any other changes in this round, and we will verify that all promised references appear in the final manuscript before resubmission. We thank the reviewers for their patience and their continued investment in improving this work.",
