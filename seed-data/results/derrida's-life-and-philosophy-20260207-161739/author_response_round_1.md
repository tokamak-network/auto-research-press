## Author Response - Round 1

### Overview

We sincerely thank all three reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their constructive feedback. The reviewers have provided remarkably consistent assessments, which helps us identify clear priorities for revision. We are grateful for the recognition of the paper's strengths—particularly its accessible prose, logical organization, and thoughtful integration of biographical context with philosophical development.

The reviewers have converged on three critical concerns: (1) the severely inadequate citation apparatus, including numerous '[citation needed]' placeholders and absence of primary Derrida texts; (2) the problematic inclusion of the Schneider reference on extraterrestrial life; and (3) the lack of a distinctive argumentative thesis or novel scholarly contribution. We accept these criticisms as valid and substantive. Our revision strategy will prioritize comprehensive citation remediation, removal of the tangential Schneider reference, and restructuring the paper around a more focused argumentative claim. We appreciate the reviewers' specific suggestions for secondary sources and their guidance toward a more rigorous scholarly contribution.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Expert 1)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank Expert 1 for their balanced evaluation (average 5.5/10) and appreciate their recognition of the paper's clarity and organizational strengths while identifying fundamental scholarly deficiencies that require immediate attention.

**Major Points**:

1. **Critically inadequate citation apparatus with '[citation needed]' placeholders**
   - **Our response**: We fully acknowledge this serious deficiency. The submission of a manuscript with placeholder citations was a significant oversight that falls below acceptable scholarly standards. We understand this undermines the credibility of every factual and interpretive claim in the paper.
   - **Action taken**: We will replace all '[citation needed]' placeholders with proper references. Specifically, we will add direct citations to *Of Grammatology* (1967/1976), *Writing and Difference* (1967/1978), *Speech and Phenomena* (1967/1973), and *Margins of Philosophy* (1972/1982). We will also incorporate key secondary sources including Spivak's translator's introduction, Gasché's *The Tain of the Mirror*, Bennington and Derrida's *Jacques Derrida*, and Norris's *Derrida*.

2. **Tangential references (Long on liturgy, Schneider on extraterrestrial life)**
   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. The Schneider reference was included to suggest interdisciplinary resonance regarding definitional instability, but we recognize this parallel is strained and detracts from rather than enhances the philosophical analysis.
   - **Action taken**: We will remove the Schneider reference entirely. The Long reference on liturgy will be evaluated for relevance; if the connection to Derrida's work on religion and the messianic is not sufficiently developed, it will also be removed or replaced with more directly relevant scholarship (e.g., Caputo's *The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida*).

3. **Lack of argumentative thesis or novel contribution**
   - **Our response**: We appreciate this important critique. The reviewer correctly identifies that the paper reads as an encyclopedia entry rather than a research contribution.
   - **Action taken**: We will restructure the paper around a focused thesis examining the relationship between Derrida's biographical experience of marginality (as an Algerian Jew under Vichy laws) and the development of his theoretical apparatus for analyzing exclusion and the logic of the supplement. This will transform the biographical material from context into evidence for an interpretive argument.

**Minor Points**: We will address the reviewer's observation about oversimplification of the speech/writing hierarchy by more carefully articulating that Derrida's project involves neither simple inversion nor neutralization but rather a demonstration of how the hierarchical opposition is always already contaminated. We will also add citations to the published documents from the Cambridge controversy.

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Expert 2)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank Expert 2 for their thorough evaluation (average 5.5/10) and their constructive suggestions for improving the manuscript's scholarly apparatus and argumentative focus.

**Major Points**:

1. **Severe citation deficiencies and absence of primary source engagement**
   - **Our response**: We agree completely. A paper discussing specific concepts like *différance* and the supplement without direct textual engagement fails to meet basic scholarly standards.
   - **Action taken**: We will incorporate direct quotations and close readings of key passages, including Derrida's explanation of *différance* in "Différance" (from *Margins of Philosophy*), the analysis of the supplement in Part II of *Of Grammatology*, and the discussion of iterability in "Signature Event Context." Page references will accompany all textual discussions.

2. **Problematic Schneider reference**
   - **Our response**: We concur that this reference is "puzzling" and "undermines the paper's credibility." The attempted analogy does not illuminate Derrida's project substantively.
   - **Action taken**: This reference will be removed in the revised manuscript.

3. **No original argument or contribution to Derrida scholarship**
   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism and appreciate the reviewer's specific suggestions for developing originality.
   - **Action taken**: Following the reviewer's guidance, we will develop a sustained analysis focusing on how Derrida's concept of the supplement (as articulated in his reading of Rousseau) provides resources for understanding contemporary debates about identity, authenticity, and technological mediation. This will engage with more recent scholarship including Hägglund's *Radical Atheism* to position our argument within current interpretive conversations.

**Minor Points**: We will add references to Spivak's translator's introduction, Critchley's work on Derrida and ethics, and the published Searle-Derrida exchange in *Limited Inc* to strengthen our discussion of critical reception. The contemporary relevance section will be either substantially developed with proper citations or condensed to avoid underdeveloped gestures.

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Expert 3)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank Expert 3 for their detailed feedback (average 5.5/10) and particularly appreciate their recognition of the paper's handling of Derrida's colonial experience and the accessibility of its prose.

**Major Points**:

1. **Critical citation failures and absence of primary Derrida texts**
   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. The reviewer is correct that approximately 20 '[citation needed]' placeholders represent "not minor gaps but the absence of basic documentation."
   - **Action taken**: Complete citation remediation as detailed above. We will ensure that every factual claim about Derrida's biography is supported by reference to established biographies (Peeters's *Derrida: A Biography*; Powell's *Jacques Derrida: A Biography*), and every interpretive claim is grounded in primary texts or acknowledged secondary scholarship.

2. **Forced Schneider reference**
   - **Our response**: We agree this "appears to be an artificial connection that weakens rather than strengthens the argument."
   - **Action taken**: The reference will be removed entirely.

3. **Superficial treatment of critics and underdeveloped contemporary relevance**
   - **Our response**: We appreciate this specific feedback. The current treatment of critical reception lacks the depth necessary for scholarly contribution.
   - **Action taken**: We will engage specifically with Searle's objections in "Reiterating the Differences" and Derrida's response in *Limited Inc*, as well as Habermas's critique in *The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity*. The contemporary relevance section will either be developed with substantive analysis of specific applications (e.g., Stiegler's technics, Butler's performativity theory) or removed to allow for deeper treatment of core concepts.

**Minor Points**: We appreciate the suggestion to narrow focus to one aspect of Derrida's thought. Given the paper's existing strength in connecting biography to philosophy, we will focus on the supplement and its relationship to Derrida's experience of exclusion, treating this with "greater depth and proper documentation" as the reviewer recommends.

- Addition of direct citations to Derrida's major works: *Of Grammatology*, *Writing and Difference*, *Speech and Phenomena*, *Margins of Philosophy*, and *Limited Inc*
- Incorporation of canonical secondary sources: Spivak, Gasché, Bennington, Norris, Culler, and Caputo
- Removal of the Schneider reference on extraterrestrial life
- Development of a focused argumentative thesis connecting Derrida's biographical experience of marginality to his theoretical apparatus of the supplement
- Substantive engagement with specific critics (Searle, Habermas) with proper citations

**Structural Changes**:
- Narrowing the paper's scope from comprehensive survey to focused argument
- Adding close readings of specific passages from Derrida's texts
