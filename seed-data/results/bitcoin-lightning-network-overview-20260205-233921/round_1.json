      "summary": "This manuscript provides a competent overview of the Lightning Network suitable for educational purposes, covering the major architectural components and current state of the network. However, it lacks the technical depth expected for a research contribution, particularly in the areas of HTLC security analysis, commitment transaction mechanics, and Bitcoin script constraints that underpin the protocol's security guarantees.",

        "The HTLC script example is oversimplified and omits critical elements including the actual witness structure, the distinction between offered and received HTLCs, and the timeout/success transaction construction that enables atomic resolution",
        "Commitment transaction structure lacks essential detail on asymmetric construction, the to_local/to_remote output scripts, anchor outputs, and the specific revocation mechanism using revocation_basepoint and per_commitment_point derivation",
        "No substantive discussion of SegWit's role in enabling Lightning (transaction malleability fix), nor the specific Bitcoin script opcodes (OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) and their interaction with relative/absolute timelocks"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Expand Section 2.3 to include complete HTLC-success and HTLC-timeout transaction structures, explaining how the two-stage HTLC resolution prevents certain attack vectors and why the CLTV delta between hops must account for blockchain confirmation times",
        "Add a dedicated subsection on commitment transaction asymmetry explaining why each party holds a different version, how revocation keys are derived using SHA256(revocation_basepoint || per_commitment_point), and the penalty transaction construction",
        "Include technical discussion of SegWit dependency, specifically how BIP141 witness segregation eliminates TXID malleability that would otherwise allow funding transaction invalidation before channel establishment"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a technical review perspective focused on HTLC construction, commitment transactions, and Bitcoin script constraints, this manuscript requires substantial strengthening. The HTLC presentation glosses over the two-stage resolution mechanism where HTLCs are first resolved via HTLC-success or HTLC-timeout transactions before funds become spendable\u2014this is not merely an implementation detail but fundamental to the security model preventing certain race conditions. The commitment transaction discussion omits the critical asymmetric construction where Alice's version allows Bob to spend immediately while Alice must wait through a CSV delay, and vice versa\u2014this asymmetry is what makes the revocation mechanism enforceable. The revocation key derivation using elliptic curve point addition (revocationpubkey = revocation_basepoint * SHA256(revocation_basepoint || per_commitment_point) + per_commitment_point * SHA256(per_commitment_point || revocation_basepoint)) deserves explicit treatment as it represents elegant cryptographic engineering. The manuscript's failure to discuss SegWit's transaction malleability fix is a significant omission\u2014without SegWit, the funding transaction's TXID could be mutated by miners, invalidating all pre-signed commitment transactions and making the protocol fundamentally insecure. The anchor outputs addition (specified in BOLT #3) addressing fee estimation challenges in commitment transactions also warrants mention. For a research contribution rather than a tutorial, the manuscript should engage more deeply with the formal security properties: atomicity guarantees of HTLCs, the game-theoretic analysis of punishment mechanisms, and the specific assumptions required (honest majority of hashpower, bounded network delay, watchtower availability) for the security model to hold.",

      "summary": "This manuscript provides a well-structured and accessible overview of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, covering fundamental concepts through recent developments. While technically sound in its descriptions, the paper lacks original research contributions and would benefit from deeper analytical rigor in its treatment of routing algorithms, liquidity management strategies, and fee market dynamics.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The pathfinding algorithm discussion is superficial\u2014mentioning 'modified Dijkstra's algorithm' without detailing the specific modifications, heuristics, or how implementations handle the NP-hard nature of finding optimal paths under liquidity uncertainty",
        "Liquidity management section lacks quantitative analysis of rebalancing costs, success rates of different strategies, or formal models of liquidity dynamics across the network",
        "Fee market dynamics treatment is descriptive rather than analytical\u2014no game-theoretic modeling of routing node competition, no analysis of fee elasticity, and no discussion of potential market failures or equilibrium states"
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Expand Section 2.4 to include formal treatment of pathfinding complexity, discussing algorithms like JIT routing, probabilistic path selection, and the tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation in route discovery",
        "Add quantitative analysis of liquidity rebalancing including empirical data on circular rebalancing success rates, submarine swap costs relative to on-chain fees, and the economic efficiency of liquidity marketplaces like Pool and Magma",
        "Develop a formal model of the fee market incorporating concepts from mechanism design\u2014analyze whether current fee structures lead to efficient routing, discuss the potential for fee wars or collusion among major routing nodes, and examine how fee policies affect network topology evolution"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "The manuscript serves well as an educational overview but falls short of the analytical depth expected for a research contribution. Regarding source-based onion routing, the paper correctly describes Sphinx packet construction but omits critical details about how senders estimate channel liquidity for pathfinding\u2014the 'probing' techniques, mission control systems in LND, and the fundamental information asymmetry problem deserve dedicated treatment. The claim that 'current implementations typically employ modified Dijkstra's algorithm' understates the sophistication of modern pathfinding; implementations use probability-based routing, historical success weighting, and multi-criteria optimization that warrant detailed examination. On liquidity management, the enumeration of strategies (circular rebalancing, submarine swaps, etc.) lacks the quantitative framework needed to evaluate their relative efficiency. What are the typical costs of each approach? Under what conditions does each strategy dominate? How do liquidity providers price their services, and is this market efficient? These questions remain unaddressed. The fee market analysis is particularly thin given its importance to network sustainability. The observation that 'low fee environment raises sustainability questions' is correct but unexplored\u2014what fee levels would be required for routing node profitability at scale? Is there evidence of fee coordination or competition? How do fee policies interact with channel selection in pathfinding? The paper would benefit from incorporating recent empirical work on Lightning Network economics and potentially original data analysis. Additionally, the network statistics cited (Q4 2024) should include confidence intervals and methodology notes, as different measurement approaches yield substantially different estimates. The treatment of centralization concerns would be strengthened by formal network analysis metrics (Gini coefficients, betweenness centrality distributions) rather than the informal percentage-based claims presented.",

    "meta_review": "Both reviewers agree that this manuscript provides a well-organized, pedagogically sound overview of the Lightning Network that is accessible to readers with varying technical backgrounds. The paper demonstrates competent coverage of protocol fundamentals, the channel lifecycle, and practical limitations including centralization concerns. The clarity of presentation is consistently praised, with scores of 8/10 and 9/10 respectively, indicating strong technical writing.\n\nHowever, both reviewers identify significant gaps that prevent this work from meeting the standards expected of a research contribution. The technical depth is insufficient in several critical areas: HTLC script mechanics lack essential details on witness structures and two-stage resolution; commitment transaction asymmetry and revocation key derivation are inadequately explained; and the foundational role of SegWit in enabling Lightning is not discussed. Beyond these protocol-level gaps, the analytical treatment of routing algorithms, liquidity dynamics, and fee markets remains descriptive rather than rigorous\u2014lacking formal models, quantitative analysis, or game-theoretic frameworks that would constitute original research contributions.\n\nThe novelty scores of 5/10 from both reviewers underscore a fundamental concern: while the manuscript succeeds as educational material, it does not advance the state of knowledge in the field. For acceptance at this venue, the authors must either substantially deepen the technical exposition to serve as a definitive reference, or contribute original analytical frameworks and empirical findings that extend beyond existing literature.",

    "recommendation": "This manuscript has clear merit as an accessible introduction to the Lightning Network, but in its current form falls short of the technical depth and analytical rigor expected for publication at this venue. The authors face a strategic choice: (1) significantly expand the technical exposition to create a definitive protocol reference, including complete script examples, cryptographic derivations, and Bitcoin-level dependencies; or (2) pivot toward original research by developing formal models of routing efficiency, liquidity economics, or fee market dynamics with quantitative validation. Either path could lead to acceptance, but the current middle ground\u2014too shallow for a technical reference, too descriptive for a research contribution\u2014must be resolved. We encourage resubmission after substantial revision addressing the specific technical gaps identified by both reviewers.",
