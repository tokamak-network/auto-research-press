      "weaknesses": [
        "The paper contains no quantitative technical detail on VQE or QPE implementations: no discussion of specific ansatz choices (UCCSD, hardware-efficient, ADAPT-VQE), no circuit depth or gate count analysis, no comparison of encoding overhead between Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev for specific molecular systems, and no concrete resource estimates beyond vaguely citing Blunt et al.'s cytochrome P450 numbers.",
        "Claims of quantum advantage or potential advantage are never substantiated with benchmarking data. The paper does not present or even summarize any head-to-head comparison between quantum algorithms and classical state-of-the-art methods (DMRG, CCSD(T), AFQMC, selected CI) for any specific molecular system, despite correctly noting that such benchmarking is essential.",

For instance, compare the qubit and gate overhead of Jordan-Wigner vs. Bravyi-Kitaev for a drug-relevant molecule of ~50-100 spin-orbitals, and discuss how symmetry reduction, active space selection, and Hamiltonian decomposition techniques (double factorization, tensor hypercontraction) affect feasibility.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of quantum algorithms for molecular simulation, this manuscript falls substantially short of the technical rigor required for a meaningful contribution. The paper correctly identifies VQE and QPE as the two primary algorithmic paradigms but treats them at a superficial level that would be appropriate for a general-audience explainer, not a research paper. For VQE, there is no discussion of ansatz design\u2014the choice between unitary coupled cluster (UCCSD), hardware-efficient ans\u00e4tze, or adaptive approaches (ADAPT-VQE) has profound implications for circuit depth, parameter count, and susceptibility to barren plateaus, yet none of this is addressed. The mention of barren plateaus is welcome but cursory; the paper does not discuss the theoretical results of McClean et al. (2018) or the mitigation strategies that have been proposed (local cost functions, layerwise training, problem-informed ans\u00e4tze). For QPE, the paper mentions 'thousands of logical qubits and millions of T-gates' for cytochrome P450 but does not unpack what these numbers mean in terms of specific algorithmic choices (first vs. second quantization, qubitization vs. Trotterization, Hamiltonian factorization strategies). The seminal resource estimation papers by Reiher et al. (2017) for FeMoco and Lee et al. (2021) for improved qubitization bounds are not cited, which is a significant omission for a paper claiming to review this space. The discussion of encoding schemes (Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev) is limited to a single paragraph that acknowledges their existence without any quantitative comparison of their impact on circuit complexity. For pharmacologically relevant molecules with 50-200+ spin-orbitals, the choice of encoding can change qubit counts and two-qubit gate counts by significant factors, and recent work on compact encodings and symmetry-adapted mappings deserves attention. The benchmarking discussion is particularly weak: the paper repeatedly states that quantum methods must be compared against classical state-of-the-art but never actually presents such a comparison for any system. A short paper could still include a table summarizing known resource estimates for representative drug-relevant molecules alongside the accuracy achievable by CCSD(T), DMRG, or AFQMC for the same systems. The inclusion of reference [9] on 'time-travel paradoxes on a quantum computer' is puzzling and appears to have no connection to drug discovery or molecular simulation. Several other references are to industry reports (McKinsey, WEF, Drug Discovery World) rather than peer-reviewed technical literature, which is acceptable for contextualizing industry interest but cannot substitute for rigorous algorithmic references. The paper would benefit enormously from narrowing its scope to a specific technical question\u2014such as a comparative resource analysis for a particular drug target, or a critical assessment of VQE accuracy vs. classical methods for a benchmark set of drug-like molecules\u2014rather than attempting to survey the entire field at a level that has already been covered more thoroughly by Blunt et al. (2022) and others.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "There is a complete absence of quantitative benchmarking against established classical drug discovery tools. No comparison is made to FEP+ (which routinely achieves ~1 kcal/mol RMSE in relative binding free energy predictions), Glide SP/XP docking, or the Schr\u00f6dinger suite. Without such comparisons, claims about quantum computing's potential to 'improve accuracy' in lead optimization and virtual screening are unsubstantiated and impossible to evaluate.",
        "The manuscript does not engage with the actual accuracy requirements of structure-based drug design. For lead optimization, relative binding free energy differences of ~0.5-1.0 kcal/mol are needed to rank congeneric series. The paper never discusses whether quantum electronic structure improvements at the active-site level would propagate meaningfully through the sampling, solvation, and entropic contributions that dominate binding free energy errors in practice. The bottleneck in FEP calculations is often conformational sampling and force field accuracy for the protein environment, not the QM accuracy of the ligand's electronic structure.",
        "The novelty is essentially zero\u2014this is a literature summary with no original analysis, no new framework, no case study, and no quantitative assessment. For a short paper, a single focused contribution explored in depth would be far more valuable than this breadth-without-depth approach."

      "suggestions": [
        "Focus the paper on a single, well-defined question\u2014for example, 'For which specific subtasks in a hit-to-lead optimization campaign would quantum-derived electronic structure data meaningfully change compound ranking relative to FEP+/MM-GBSA?' Provide a quantitative error budget analysis showing where QM accuracy improvements would (or would not) matter given the other sources of error in binding affinity prediction.",
        "Include explicit numerical comparisons: cite the known accuracy of VQE calculations on small molecules (e.g., H2, LiH, BeH2) in terms of chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol), and contrast this with the system sizes and accuracy levels routinely achieved by classical methods like DLPNO-CCSD(T) or \u03c9B97X-D for drug-like molecules (20-80 heavy atoms). This would ground the discussion in reality rather than aspiration.",
        "Address the integration feasibility problem concretely: a typical virtual screening campaign evaluates 10^6-10^9 compounds. Discuss the throughput limitations of quantum processors (circuit execution times, shot noise requirements) and estimate how many compounds per day could realistically be evaluated with a quantum-enhanced scoring function versus classical docking. Reference [9] (Violaris, on causality and time-travel paradoxes) appears entirely irrelevant to drug discovery and should be removed."
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of computational medicinal chemistry and structure-based drug design, this manuscript suffers from a fundamental disconnect between its claims and the practical realities of the field. The paper repeatedly asserts that quantum computing will improve binding affinity prediction, virtual screening, and lead optimization, but never engages with the quantitative details that would make these claims credible or falsifiable. In modern pharmaceutical CADD, the state of the art for relative binding free energy prediction is FEP+ and related alchemical methods, which achieve RMSEs of approximately 0.9-1.2 kcal/mol for well-behaved congeneric series. The dominant sources of error in these calculations are force field inaccuracies for the protein-ligand complex, inadequate conformational sampling, and treatment of explicit solvation\u2014not the electronic structure accuracy of the ligand in isolation. A quantum computer providing exact electronic energies for a 50-atom ligand in vacuum would not address these bottlenecks. The paper should critically examine whether the QM/MM interface problem (coupling a quantum-computed QM region with a classically-described MM environment) would preserve the quantum accuracy advantage, given that the MM region introduces errors of several kcal/mol. Furthermore, the manuscript's discussion of virtual screening ignores the throughput problem entirely: classical docking with Glide can screen millions of compounds per day, whereas a single VQE energy evaluation on current hardware requires thousands of circuit executions and minutes to hours of wall time. The claim that quantum-enhanced scoring functions will reduce false-positive rates in virtual screening is unsupported by any evidence or even a plausible mechanism. The reference list includes several questionable choices: reference [9] on time-travel paradoxes has no relevance to drug discovery, and several references are to non-peer-reviewed sources (McKinsey reports, World Economic Forum articles, Drug Discovery World) that, while acceptable for context, should not serve as primary support for scientific claims. Key references from the computational chemistry community are missing, including the seminal work by Reiher et al. (PNAS 2017) on quantum resource estimates for FeMoco, and recent work by Google/Boehringer Ingelheim on quantum chemistry for drug discovery. The paper would benefit enormously from narrowing its scope to a single well-defined question and providing the quantitative analysis that the field needs, rather than offering another high-level narrative that computational medicinal chemists cannot act upon.",

    "meta_review": "Both reviewers converge on the same fundamental diagnosis: this manuscript is a broad, clearly written narrative review of quantum computing in drug discovery that lacks any original contribution\u2014no novel framework, no quantitative benchmarking, no resource estimates, no case study, and no critical analysis beyond what is already available in existing reviews. The reviewers are not being unreasonably harsh; their criticisms are substantive and well-calibrated. Even for a review article rather than original research, the field expects either a new organizing framework, a systematic comparison, or a focused critical analysis that advances understanding. This manuscript provides none of these. The concerns are consistent across both reviewers and reflect genuine deficiencies rather than nitpicking.\n\nCritically, the manuscript also appears to be truncated (flagged as ending mid-sentence), which alone would preclude acceptance. Additionally, both reviewers independently flagged Reference [9] (on causality and time-travel paradoxes) as entirely irrelevant to the topic, raising concerns about citation quality and editorial care. The complete absence of quantitative grounding\u2014no comparison of quantum algorithm performance against classical state-of-the-art methods (FEP+, DMRG, CCSD(T)), no circuit resource estimates, no discussion of throughput feasibility for real drug discovery campaigns\u2014means the paper cannot substantiate its claims about quantum computing's potential.\n\nHowever, the paper does have a solid structural foundation: clear writing, logical organization, and correct identification of key challenges (barren plateaus, NISQ limitations, need for classical benchmarking). This provides a viable skeleton for a substantially improved revision. The path to an acceptable manuscript is clear but requires significant additional work: the authors must either (a) narrow the scope to a specific, well-defined question and provide original quantitative analysis, or (b) transform this into a rigorous systematic review with concrete benchmarks and critical evaluation rather than a high-level survey.",

  "author_response": "# Author Response - Round 1\n\n## Overview\n\nWe thank both reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback. The reviews converge on several critical points: (1) the manuscript reads as a narrative literature survey rather than a research contribution with original technical or conceptual depth; (2) the paper lacks quantitative benchmarking data comparing quantum approaches to state-of-the-art classical methods; (3) technical discussions of algorithms, resource estimates, and encoding schemes are superficial; and (4) the scope is too broad for the depth provided. We recognize these criticisms as valid and substantive. Rather than defend the current manuscript, we have decided to restructure the work fundamentally around a single, well-defined technical contribution with concrete quantitative analysis. Below, we outline our response to each reviewer's major concerns and describe the revised approach.\n\n---\n\n## Response to Reviewer 1: Quantum Algorithms for Molecular Simulation\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's score (4.5/10) and agree with the core assessment: the current manuscript lacks the technical rigor, quantitative specificity, and novel contribution expected from a quantum algorithms perspective. The criticisms regarding missing resource estimates, absent ansatz analysis, and lack of benchmarking are well-founded.\n\n### Major Points\n\n**1. Absence of quantitative technical detail on VQE and QPE implementations**\n\n- **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that the current treatment of VQE and QPE is superficial. We did not discuss ansatz choices (UCCSD vs. hardware-efficient vs. ADAPT-VQE), circuit depths, gate counts, or encoding overhead comparisons. This was a significant oversight that undermines credibility in the algorithms community.\n  \n- **Action taken**: We will restructure the manuscript around a **focused case study**: a comparative resource analysis for a pharmacologically relevant molecular system (a metalloenzyme active site with ~60-100 spin-orbitals, e.g., a simplified model of a P450 active site or FeMoco-like system). We will provide:\n  - Original or updated resource estimates comparing Jordan-Wigner (JW) vs. Bravyi-Kitaev (BK) encodings for this specific system, with explicit qubit counts and two-qubit gate counts under each scheme\n  - Detailed discussion of ansatz choices (UCCSD, hardware-efficient, ADAPT-VQE) and their impact on circuit depth and parameter count\n  - Quantitative analysis of how symmetry reduction and active space selection affect feasibility\n  - Comparison of Hamiltonian factorization strategies (double factorization, tensor hypercontraction) and their circuit-level implications\n\n**2. Lack of benchmarking data and unsubstantiated claims of quantum advantage**\n\n- **Our response**: The reviewer correctly notes that we claim benchmarking is essential but provide no actual benchmarks. This is a critical gap. We cannot claim quantum advantage or potential advantage without concrete comparisons.\n  \n- **Action taken**: We will include a **quantitative benchmarking table** (or short section) that:\n  - Summarizes known VQE accuracy results for small benchmark molecules (H\u2082, LiH, BeH2, H\u2082O) in terms of error relative to FCI/CCSD(T)\n  - Compares these to the accuracy achievable by classical state-of-the-art methods (CCSD(T), DMRG, AFQMC) for the same systems\n  - Explicitly discusses the \"quantum advantage threshold\"\u2014the problem size and accuracy requirement at which quantum methods would outperform classical alternatives\u2014based on current resource estimates\n  - Acknowledges that this threshold remains beyond current NISQ capabilities and provides a realistic timeline based on published roadmaps\n\n**3. Zero novelty and poor citation quality**\n\n- **Our response**: We accept that the current manuscript is a literature survey without novel contribution. The inclusion of reference [9] (Violaris 2025, on causality and time-travel paradoxes) is indefensible and represents a citation error on our part.\n  \n- **Action taken**: \n  - We will **remove reference [9]** entirely.\n  - We will restructure the paper to present an **original technical contribution**: either (a) new resource estimates for a specific drug-relevant target under different encoding/ansatz choices, or (b) a critical analysis of the quantum advantage threshold for drug discovery, showing under what conditions quantum methods would be preferable to classical alternatives.\n  - We will strengthen the citation base with key technical references currently missing:\n    - Lee et al. (2021) on improved qubitization resource estimates\n    - Goings et al. (2022) on fault-tolerant quantum chemistry for drug discovery\n    - Reiher et al. (2017) on FeMoco resource estimates\n    - von Burg et al. (2021) on tensor hypercontraction for quantum chemistry\n    - McClean et al. (2018) on barren plateaus and mitigation strategies\n\n### Minor Points\n\n- We will expand the discussion of barren plateaus beyond a single mention to include mitigation strategies (local cost functions, layerwise training, problem-informed ans\u00e4tze) and their implications for circuit depth and wall-clock time.\n- We will add a dedicated section on encoding schemes with quantitative comparison of JW vs. BK vs. compact mappings for a representative drug-like molecule, showing how these choices affect qubit and gate counts.\n- We will clarify the distinction between \"quantum advantage\" (outperforming all classical methods) and \"quantum utility\" (providing useful results faster or more accurately than available classical tools), and frame our discussion in terms of realistic near-term utility rather than asymptotic advantage.\n\n---\n\n## Response to Reviewer 2: Computational Medicinal Chemistry and Structure-Based Drug Design\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the reviewer's score (4.3/10) and agree that the manuscript fails to engage with the practical realities of computational drug discovery. The absence of comparisons to production-grade tools (FEP+, Glide, etc.) and the disconnect between quantum computing claims and actual pharmaceutical requirements are serious weaknesses.\n\n### Major Points\n\n**1. Complete absence of quantitative benchmarking against classical drug discovery tools**\n\n- **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that we make claims about improving accuracy in binding affinity prediction and virtual screening without any numerical comparison to FEP+, Glide, or other standard tools. This is a fundamental credibility problem for the medicinal chemistry audience.\n  \n- **Action taken**: We will include an **error budget analysis** that:\n  - Cites the known accuracy of FEP+ (~0.9\u20131.2 kcal/mol RMSE for relative binding free energies)\n  - Compares this to the accuracy achievable by VQE for small ligands (currently limited to <10 heavy atoms with chemical accuracy ~1 kcal/mol)\n  - Discusses the dominant error sources in binding free energy calculations: force field inaccuracy for the protein-ligand complex, conformational sampling, solvation treatment, and entropic contributions\u2014most of which are not improved by better electronic structure for the ligand alone\n  - Provides a realistic assessment of where quantum-derived electronic structure data would (and would not) meaningfully change compound ranking in a lead optimization campaign\n  - Acknowledges the QM/MM interface problem: coupling a quantum-computed QM region to a classically-described MM environment may erode the quantum advantage\n\n**2. Failure to engage with actual accuracy requirements and the sampling/solvation bottleneck**\n\n- **Our response**: The reviewer makes an excellent point: improving the electronic structure of a ligand in vacuum does not necessarily improve binding affinity predictions when the bottleneck is conformational sampling, protein environment description, and solvation. We did not address this critical gap.\n  \n- **Action taken**: We will add a **detailed discussion** of:\n  - The typical error budget for FEP calculations, showing that QM accuracy improvements for the ligand represent only a small fraction of total error\n  - Why the conformational sampling and force field accuracy for the protein-ligand complex dominate binding affinity errors in practice\n  - The specific subtasks in a hit-to-lead campaign where quantum-derived data might matter (e.g., electronic effects on ionization states, pKa shifts, metal-ligand bonding in metalloproteins) versus where they would not (e.g., relative binding free energies for congeneric series with similar conformational ensembles)\n  - A case study or worked example showing how quantum improvements would propagate (or fail to propagate) through a real FEP calculation\n\n**3. No engagement with throughput and integration feasibility**\n\n- **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we ignore the throughput problem: classical docking screens millions of compounds per day, while VQE evaluations require minutes to hours per molecule. This is a fatal problem for virtual screening applications that we did not address.\n  \n- **Action taken**: We will add a **concrete feasibility analysis** including:\n  - Realistic estimates of quantum processor throughput (circuit execution times, shot noise requirements, error correction overhead) based on published hardware roadmaps\n  - A calculation of how many compounds per day could realistically be evaluated with a quantum-enhanced scoring function versus classical docking (likely many orders of magnitude fewer)\n  - Discussion of whether quantum screening would be useful for early-stage campaigns (large libraries, low accuracy requirements) versus lead optimization (smaller libraries, high accuracy requirements)\n  - Acknowledgment that quantum-enhanced scoring is unlikely to be competitive with classical methods for virtual screening at scale in the foreseeable future, but may have niche applications in QM/MM refinement of a pre-selected subset\n\n### Minor Points\n\n- We will remove reference [9] and strengthen citations to peer-reviewed computational chemistry literature, particularly work from the Reiher group and recent publications on quantum chemistry for drug discovery.\n- We will replace or supplement industry reports (McKinsey, WEF) with peer-reviewed technical references, using the industry reports only for contextualizing market interest rather than supporting scientific claims.\n- We will clarify the distinction between drug discovery phases and where quantum computing might realistically contribute (e.g., QM/MM refinement for hit-to-lead optimization of metalloproteins, not large-scale virtual screening).\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n### Structural Revisions\n1. **Refocus the manuscript** from a broad narrative review to a **focused technical contribution**: either (a) original resource estimates for a specific drug-relevant molecular system (metalloenzyme active site) comparing encoding and ansatz choices, or (b) a critical analysis of the quantum advantage threshold for drug discovery applications.\n\n2. **Add a quantitative benchmarking section** that compares VQE/QPE accuracy and resource requirements to state-of-the-art classical methods (CCSD(T), DMRG, AFQMC, FEP+, Glide) for representative drug-like molecules and binding affinity targets.\n\n3. **Expand technical depth** on:\n   - VQE ansatz design and circuit depth implications (UCCSD vs. hardware-efficient vs. ADAPT-VQE)\n   - Encoding schemes with quantitative comparison of JW, BK, and compact mappings\n   - Hamiltonian factorization strategies (double factorization, tensor hypercontraction)\n   - Barren plateau mitigation strategies and their wall-clock time implications\n\n### Content Additions\n4. **Error budget analysis** showing where quantum improvements would and would not matter in binding free energy calculations, with explicit discussion of the sampling/solvation bottleneck.\n\n5. **Throughput and feasibility analysis** for virtual screening and lead optimization, with realistic estimates of quantum processor throughput versus classical methods.\n\n6. **Case study or worked example** demonstrating how quantum-derived electronic structure data would propagate through a real FEP or QM/MM calculation.\n\n### Citation and Clarity Improvements\n7. **Remove reference [9]** (Violaris, time-travel paradoxes) entirely.\n\n8. **Add key technical references**: Lee et al. (2021), Goings et al. (2022), Reiher et al. (2017), von Burg et al. (2021), McClean et al. (2018), and other foundational works in quantum chemistry resource estimation.\n\n9. **Clarify terminology**: distinguish between \"quantum advantage,\" \"quantum utility,\" and \"quantum hype,\" and frame the discussion in terms of realistic near-term applications rather than asymptotic claims.\n\n10. **Strengthen the narrative** around the quantum advantage threshold: at what problem size and accuracy requirement would quantum methods outperform classical alternatives, and when (if ever) might this be relevant for drug discovery?\n\n---\n\n## Closing Remarks\n\nWe recognize that the current manuscript attempts to cover too much ground at insufficient depth, and we appreciate the reviewers' clear articulation of what the field needs: not another high-level survey, but a focused, quantitatively rigorous contribution that either advances our understanding of quantum algorithms for molecular simulation or provides actionable insights for computational drug discovery. We are committed to restructuring the work to meet this standard. We will submit a substantially revised manuscript within 6-8 weeks that addresses these concerns with original technical analysis, concrete benchmarking data, and realistic assessment of quantum computing's role in drug discovery.\n\nThank you again for your time and expertise.",
