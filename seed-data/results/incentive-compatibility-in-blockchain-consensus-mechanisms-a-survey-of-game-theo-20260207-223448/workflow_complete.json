            "Expand citation coverage significantly: a survey should reference seminal works on selfish mining (Eyal & Sirer), formal PoS analyses (Buterin, Saleh), MEV literature, and game-theoretic security proofs - the current two-reference approach is inadequate"
          ],
          "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptoeconomic security perspective, this paper misses critical analytical depth. The discussion of selfish mining correctly identifies the attack but provides no quantitative analysis of profitability thresholds, network parameter dependencies, or defense mechanisms. The claim that selfish mining is profitable 'well below 50%' needs specific thresholds (e.g., 25% under certain connectivity assumptions). The nothing-at-stake problem is mentioned but without rigorous game-theoretic formalization - where is the payoff matrix, the equilibrium analysis showing why rational validators would deviate?\n\nMost concerning is the absence of formal adversarial models. The paper conflates Byzantine and rational adversaries without clearly distinguishing their capabilities and objectives. Cryptoeconomic security requires explicit threat models: What is the adversary's budget? Are they profit-maximizing or Byzantine? Can they form coalitions? The paper gestures at these issues but never formalizes them. The discussion of slashing mechanisms lacks any quantitative analysis of optimal penalty structures - this is a core cryptoeconomic design question that deserves mathematical treatment.\n\nThe security-incentive tradeoff analysis is superficial. For example, the paper mentions that PoS systems must 'carefully balance' slashing severity against participation risk but provides no framework for this optimization. What is the minimum security deposit required for economic finality? How do we quantify the cost of attacks versus the cost of honest participation? These are fundamental questions in cryptoeconomic security that remain unaddressed.\n\nThe citation strategy is problematic for a survey. Relying primarily on two sources (one from 2015, one from 2019) while marking numerous claims '[citation needed]' suggests either incomplete literature review or awareness that claims lack support. Key works on game-theoretic security (Eyal & Sirer on selfish mining, various formal PoS analyses, the extensive MEV literature) are absent. For a short paper, this might be acceptable if the core analysis were rigorous, but the combination of limited citations and limited analytical depth is concerning.",

The characterization of PoW and PoS is generally accurate but superficial - for instance, the selfish mining discussion mentions profitability 'well below 50%' without citing the actual threshold (approximately 25% under certain network conditions, per Eyal & Sirer). The nothing-at-stake problem is correctly identified, but the paper doesn't explain WHY slashing solves it game-theoretically (it changes the payoff structure to make multi-chain validation dominated). The treatment of Nash equilibria is conceptually sound but never formalized - a survey should at minimum define the strategy space and payoff functions for one consensus game. The '[citation needed]' markers are particularly problematic in sections on formal verification and behavioral economics, suggesting incomplete research. The omission of practical BFT protocols (PBFT, HotStuff, Tendermint) is a significant gap, as these have well-studied game-theoretic properties distinct from PoW/PoS. The paper would benefit from: (1) removing placeholder citations and adding real references, (2) including at least one worked example of equilibrium analysis with mathematical notation, (3) adding a section on BFT-based consensus, and (4) providing quantitative security parameters where known. The writing is clear and well-organized, but the technical content needs substantial strengthening to meet publication standards.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From an algorithmic game theory and mechanism design perspective, this paper exhibits several concerning gaps. First, the treatment of Nash equilibrium is superficial\u2014the paper repeatedly claims protocols achieve Nash equilibrium without formally defining the game, specifying strategy spaces, or proving equilibrium existence. For instance, the statement that 'honest mining constitutes a Nash equilibrium' (Section on PoW) needs formal support: what is the strategy space? What are the payoff functions? Under what information structure? The paper conflates different equilibrium concepts (Nash, subgame perfect, Bayesian) without precision.\n\nThe revelation principle discussion is particularly problematic. The paper states it 'suggests that well-designed protocols should make honest participation a dominant strategy' but this misunderstands the principle's scope. The revelation principle applies to mechanisms where the designer controls the message space and outcome function\u2014blockchain protocols are better modeled as implementation problems in incomplete information settings. The connection between truthful reporting in mechanism design and protocol compliance in blockchains needs much more careful development.\n\nThe incentive compatibility analysis lacks rigor throughout. The paper never formally defines what 'incentive compatible' means in the blockchain context. Is it dominant strategy IC? Bayesian IC? Ex-post Nash? The distinction matters enormously. For selfish mining, the paper should formally show the deviation payoff exceeds the honest payoff under specified conditions, not just assert profitability.\n\nThe citation practices are unacceptable for a technical survey. Seven instances of '[citation needed]' appear in a short paper, including for fundamental claims about formal verification and the revelation principle. This suggests the authors are making assertions beyond what their two primary sources support. A survey should comprehensively cite the literature\u2014where are references to Eyal & Sirer (2014) on selfish mining, Kiayias et al. on Ouroboros, Buterin & Griffith on Casper FFG, or foundational mechanism design work by Myerson, Maskin, or Hurwicz?\n\nThe paper would benefit from at least one concrete example with mathematical detail. For instance, formally model the selfish mining game: define states (public chain length, private chain length), actions (mine on public/private, release blocks), transition probabilities, and payoffs. Then characterize when deviation is profitable. This would demonstrate actual game-theoretic analysis rather than just describing it.\n\nFinally, the paper lacks any novel contribution. For a survey, this might be acceptable, but the paper should then be more comprehensive in its coverage and more rigorous in its synthesis. As written, it reads more like a term paper summarizing two sources rather than an authoritative survey of the field.",

        "meta_review": "This manuscript attempts to survey game-theoretic approaches to blockchain consensus mechanisms, and reviewers consistently acknowledge its clear organizational structure and accurate identification of key concepts (selfish mining, nothing-at-stake, incentive compatibility). However, all three reviewers converge on a fundamental problem that I find substantive rather than nitpicking: the paper relies on only two references while containing multiple '[citation needed]' placeholders. For a survey paper\u2014even a short one\u2014this is a significant methodological flaw, not a minor presentation issue. A survey's core value proposition is synthesizing and organizing existing literature; incomplete citations undermine this fundamental purpose.\n\nThe reviewers' demands for mathematical formalization and quantitative analysis are calibrated appropriately for a paper that explicitly invokes game-theoretic concepts like Nash equilibrium and incentive compatibility. When a paper claims to analyze these concepts, readers reasonably expect at least one formal game definition or worked example. This isn't demanding theoretical novelty\u2014it's asking for technical precision commensurate with the paper's own framing. That said, I note some reviewer suggestions (e.g., 'add 8-12 more targeted references,' 'include comparative tables') may be aspirational rather than strictly required for a short survey.\n\nGiven this is Round 1 of 2, major revision is appropriate. The core issues\u2014incomplete citations and lack of any formal treatment\u2014are fixable but require substantial work. The paper has a solid structural foundation and identifies the right topics; it needs to deliver on its implicit promises of rigor.

      "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback. We appreciate the time and expertise invested in evaluating our manuscript. The reviews reveal consistent themes across all three assessments: (1) inadequate citation coverage for a survey paper, (2) lack of mathematical formalization and rigor in game-theoretic analysis, (3) absence of quantitative security parameters and thresholds, and (4) missing coverage of important protocol families and formal models.\n\nWe acknowledge these are fundamental weaknesses that significantly limit the contribution of our work. Rather than attempting incremental improvements, we propose a substantial revision that transforms this from a brief overview into a rigorous technical survey. Our revision strategy includes: expanding the reference list from 2 to approximately 25-30 targeted citations covering seminal works and recent advances; adding formal mathematical definitions and at least two worked examples with complete game-theoretic analysis; incorporating quantitative security thresholds and economic parameters throughout; and expanding coverage to include BFT protocols and hybrid consensus mechanisms. We address each reviewer's specific concerns below.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Cryptoeconomic Security Analysis)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We accept the 4.8/10 average score and agree that our treatment of cryptoeconomic security lacks the analytical depth required for a technical survey. The reviewer correctly identifies that we gesture at important concepts without formalizing them.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Insufficient quantitative security-incentive tradeoff analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We fully agree this is a critical gap. The reviewer is correct that we mention concepts like \"careful balancing\" without providing the mathematical framework for optimization.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new dedicated section (2.5 pages) on \"Quantitative Security Analysis\" that includes:\n     * Formal definition of economic security as the cost to attack a system\n     * Mathematical formulation of the selfish mining profitability threshold (following Eyal & Sirer 2014, Sapirshtein et al. 2016)\n     * Analysis of optimal slashing parameters using the framework from Buterin & Griffith (2017) and Saleh (2021), including the tradeoff between deterrence and participation costs\n     * Minimum viable security deposit calculations for economic finality\n     * Concrete numerical examples showing attack cost vs. reward under different parameter settings\n\n2. **Weak adversarial modeling**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer makes an excellent point that we conflate Byzantine and rational adversaries without proper distinction. This is a fundamental error in cryptoeconomic analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 3.1 \"Adversarial Models in Blockchain Consensus\" (1.5 pages) that:\n     * Formally defines Byzantine adversaries (arbitrary behavior, unbounded computational power within limits)\n     * Formally defines rational adversaries (profit-maximizing, strategic behavior)\n     * Introduces the Byzantine-rational hybrid model from Garay et al. (2015)\n     * Analyzes coalition formation dynamics using coalition game theory\n     * Discusses adaptive adversaries who learn and adjust strategies\n     * Explicitly states threat model assumptions for each protocol discussed\n\n3. **Over-reliance on two references with multiple '[citation needed]' markers**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. This is unacceptable for a survey paper and undermines our credibility.\n   - **Action taken**: We will:\n     * Remove all '[citation needed]' placeholders\u2014claims without support will be either properly cited or removed\n     * Expand references to include: Eyal & Sirer (2014) on selfish mining, Sapirshtein et al. (2016) on optimal selfish mining, Buterin & Griffith (2017) on Casper FFG, Saleh (2021) on PoS analysis, Daian et al. (2019) on MEV, Bonneau et al. (2015) on PoS attacks, Kiayias et al. (2017) on Ouroboros, Garay et al. (2015) on Bitcoin backbone protocol\n     * Add approximately 20-25 additional targeted references covering game-theoretic security proofs, formal analyses, and cryptoeconomic mechanism design\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We will add specific quantitative thresholds throughout (e.g., 25% for selfish mining under certain connectivity assumptions rather than vague \"well below 50%\")\n- We will include payoff matrices for key games (nothing-at-stake, validator coordination)\n- We will formalize the equilibrium analysis showing why rational validators would deviate in nothing-at-stake scenarios\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Distributed Consensus Protocols)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the 5.7/10 score and acknowledge that while our high-level characterizations are accurate, we lack the technical precision expected even in a short survey.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Critical under-citation problem**\n   - **Our response**: We agree completely. The reviewer's point that this \"undermines credibility as a survey\" is well-taken.\n   - **Action taken**: As outlined above, we will expand to 25-30 references. Specifically for consensus protocols, we will add: Castro & Liskov (1999) on PBFT, Buchman et al. (2016) on Tendermint, Yin et al. (2019) on HotStuff, Gilad et al. (2017) on Algorand, and Abraham et al. (2017) on recent BFT advances.\n\n2. **Lacks technical rigor\u2014no formal definitions or mathematical characterization**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we describe equilibria without defining them. This is a fundamental weakness.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 2.2 \"Formal Game Models\" (2 pages) containing:\n     * Complete formal definition of the mining game: state space S = {(h_pub, h_priv, blocks_withheld)}, action space A = {mine_public, mine_private, release_k_blocks}, transition function T, and payoff function \u03c0 based on block rewards and network propagation\n     * Formal characterization of Nash equilibrium for honest mining: show that no miner can increase expected payoff by unilateral deviation given honest strategies by others\n     * Mathematical proof sketch showing when selfish mining becomes profitable (deviation payoff > honest payoff)\n     * For PoS: formal definition of the validator game with strategy space including attestation choices and slashing penalties\n     * Explicit equilibrium analysis for the nothing-at-stake problem with payoff matrix showing why multi-chain validation dominates without slashing\n\n3. **Missing coverage of BFT variants and DAG-based protocols**\n   - **Our response**: We agree this is a significant gap. These protocols have distinct game-theoretic properties worth analyzing.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 4 \"Beyond PoW and PoS: Alternative Consensus Mechanisms\" (2 pages) covering:\n     * BFT-based protocols (PBFT, Tendermint, HotStuff): game-theoretic properties of leader-based consensus, incentive compatibility challenges\n     * DAG-based protocols (IOTA, Hashgraph): game-theoretic implications of parallel block production\n     * Comparative analysis of incentive structures across protocol families\n\n4. **Insufficient depth on key technical details**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer's specific examples (selfish mining threshold, specific slashing mechanisms) highlight where we need concrete detail.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add:\n     * Detailed analysis of selfish mining profitability: mathematical derivation showing threshold \u2248 25% under \u03b3=0.5 (equal propagation), with sensitivity analysis for different network parameters\n     * Specific slashing mechanisms from deployed systems: Ethereum 2.0's inactivity leak, Cosmos's evidence-based slashing, with game-theoretic analysis of deterrence effectiveness\n     * Comparative table (as suggested) summarizing equilibrium types, attack vectors, and quantitative thresholds across protocol families\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We will remove all '[citation needed]' markers and replace with actual citations\n- We will add the comparative table as Table 1 in Section 3\n- We will expand the nothing-at-stake discussion to explain specific protocol solutions mechanistically\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Algorithmic Game Theory and Mechanism Design)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We accept the 4.8/10 score and acknowledge the \"concerning gaps\" in our mechanism design analysis. The reviewer's expertise in this area is evident, and their criticisms are particularly valuable.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Lacks mathematical formalization of games**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is absolutely correct. We claim to analyze Nash equilibria without defining the games\u2014this is methodologically unsound.\n   - **Action taken**: As described for Reviewer 2, we will add complete formal game definitions. Specifically:\n     * Mining game: G = (N, S, A, T, \u03c0) where N = {miners}, S = state space (chain configurations), A = action space (mining/release decisions), T = transition probabilities, \u03c0 = payoff functions mapping outcomes to rewards\n     * Nash equilibrium definition: A strategy profile \u03c3* where \u03c0_i(\u03c3*) \u2265 \u03c0_i(\u03c3_i', \u03c3*_{-i}) for all i and all alternative strategies \u03c3_i'\n     * Formal proof that honest mining is Nash equilibrium under certain conditions\n     * Explicit utility functions incorporating block rewards, transaction fees, and costs\n\n2. **Misapplication of revelation principle**\n   - **Our response**: We appreciate this correction. The reviewer is right that we misunderstand the principle's scope and its connection to blockchain protocols.\n   - **Action taken**: We will:\n     * Revise Section 5.2 to correctly explain the revelation principle in its proper context (mechanisms where designers control message spaces and outcome functions)\n     * Clarify that blockchain protocols are better modeled as implementation problems in incomplete information settings\n     * Remove the oversimplified claim about dominant strategies\n     * Add proper discussion of mechanism design challenges in decentralized settings where no single party controls the mechanism\n     * Cite foundational mechanism design literature (Myerson 1981, Maskin 1999) for proper context\n\n3. **Imprecise incentive compatibility claims**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we never formally define what \"incentive compatible\" means in our context and conflate different equilibrium concepts.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 5.1 \"Incentive Compatibility in Blockchain Protocols\" (1.5 pages) that:\n     * Defines dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC): reporting truth/following protocol maximizes utility regardless of others' actions\n     * Defines Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC): following protocol maximizes expected utility given beliefs about others\n     * Defines ex-post Nash equilibrium: following protocol is best response given others follow protocol\n     * Clarifies which concept applies to each protocol discussed\n     * For selfish mining: formally shows deviation payoff exceeds honest payoff under specified conditions using mathematical derivation\n\n4. **Unacceptable citation practices**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism completely. The reviewer's characterization that it \"reads more like a term paper summarizing two sources\" is harsh but fair.\n   - **Action taken**: Beyond expanding general citations, we will specifically add:\n     * Mechanism design foundations: Myerson (1981), Maskin (1999), Hurwicz (1973)\n     * Blockchain-specific game theory: Eyal & Sirer (2014), Kiayias et al. (2017), Buterin & Griffith (2017)\n     * Implementation theory connections: Jackson (1991), Maskin & Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (2002)\n     * All '[citation needed]' markers will be resolved with proper citations or the claims removed\n\n5. **No novel contribution and lacks concrete examples**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that as written, this is a weak survey without novel insights. The reviewer's suggestion for a worked example with mathematical detail is excellent.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 2.3 \"Worked Example: Selfish Mining Game\" (2 pages) containing:\n     * Complete formal model: states (h_pub, h_priv), actions, transition probabilities based on network propagation parameter \u03b3\n     * Payoff calculation: expected rewards as function of mining power \u03b1, propagation \u03b3, and strategy\n     * Mathematical derivation of profitability condition: \u03b1 > \u03b1_threshold where \u03b1_threshold = (1-\u03b3)/(3-2\u03b3) for \u03b3 \u2264 0.5\n     * Numerical examples: show that with \u03b3=0.5, threshold is 25%; with \u03b3=0, threshold is 33%\n     * Discussion of defense mechanisms and their game-theoretic implications\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We will distinguish equilibrium concepts (Nash, subgame perfect, Bayesian) precisely throughout\n- We will add formal strategy space and payoff function definitions for each game discussed\n- We will clarify information structures (complete vs. incomplete information) for each protocol\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Structural Revisions:**\n- Expand manuscript from ~2,000 to ~6,000 words to accommodate rigorous technical content\n- Add new Section 2.2 \"Formal Game Models\" with complete mathematical definitions\n- Add new Section 2.3 \"Worked Example: Selfish Mining Game\" with detailed mathematical analysis\n- Add new Section 2.5 \"Quantitative Security Analysis\" covering economic security parameters\n- Add new Section 3.1 \"Adversarial Models\" formally defining threat models\n- Add new Section 4 \"Beyond PoW and PoS\" covering BFT and alternative consensus\n- Add new Section 5.1 \"Incentive Compatibility in Blockchain Protocols\" with precise definitions\n\n**Citation Improvements:**\n- Expand from 2 to 25-30 targeted references covering:\n  * Foundational game theory and mechanism design (Myerson, Maskin, Hurwicz)\n  * Blockchain-specific game-theoretic analyses (Eyal & Sirer, Sapirshtein et al., Saleh)\n  * Consensus protocol papers (Castro & Liskov, Buchman et al., Kiayias et al.)\n  * Cryptoeconomic security (Buterin & Griffith, Bonneau et al., Garay et al.)\n  * MEV and recent advances (Daian et al., Flashbots research)\n- Remove all '[citation needed]' placeholders\n\n**Technical Content Additions:**\n- Add formal game definitions with strategy spaces, payoff functions, and equilibrium characterizations\n- Include quantitative security thresholds (e.g., 25% for selfish mining) throughout\n- Add payoff matrices for key games (nothing-at-stake, validator coordination)\n- Include mathematical derivations for attack profitability conditions\n- Add comparative table summarizing game-theoretic properties across consensus families\n- Provide concrete numerical examples with parameter sensitivity analysis\n\n**Clarifications and Corrections:**\n- Correct misapplication of revelation principle with proper mechanism design context\n- Distinguish Byzantine, rational, and hybrid adversarial models explicitly\n- Clarify incentive compatibility concepts (DSIC, BIC, ex-post Nash) and which applies where\n- Add formal proof sketches for equilibrium claims\n- Explain specific protocol solutions (Casper FFG slashing, checkpointing) mechanistically\n\n**Timeline:**\nWe anticipate completing these revisions within 6-8 weeks given the substantial expansion required. We believe these changes will transform the manuscript into a rigorous technical survey that makes a genuine contribution to the literature by providing comprehensive game-theoretic analysis of blockchain consensus mechanisms with proper mathematical formalization and adequate citation coverage.\n\nWe thank the reviewers again for their invaluable feedback and look forward to submitting a significantly strengthened revision.",

          "detailed_feedback": "As a distributed consensus protocols expert, I must acknowledge the substantial technical improvements while expressing deep disappointment at the citation failure. The authors clearly engaged with the technical feedback\u2014the formal game definitions are excellent, the quantitative thresholds are precisely what was requested, and the adversarial model distinctions are properly formulated. The mining game formalization with state space S, action space A, and payoff function \u03c0 is textbook-quality. The selfish mining threshold analysis with \u03b3-dependent formulas (25% at \u03b3=0.5, 33% at \u03b3=0) provides exactly the quantitative rigor that was missing.\n\nHowever, the citation situation is inexcusable. The authors explicitly promised to expand from 2 to 25-30 references, acknowledged this as 'unacceptable for a survey paper,' and detailed specific papers they would add. Yet the revised manuscript still contains only the original 2 references. Every major technical claim\u2014the selfish mining formula, the slashing penalty derivation, the BFT f<n/3 bound\u2014appears without citation. This is not a minor oversight; it's a fundamental failure to meet survey paper standards.\n\nThe technical content itself is now strong enough for a short paper. The comparative table effectively synthesizes protocol properties. The distinction between DSIC, BIC, and ex-post Nash is properly applied. The slashing economics analysis with graduated penalties and minimum security deposits shows good understanding of practical PoS design. The adversarial model section correctly distinguishes Byzantine, rational, and hybrid threats.\n\nBut several technical gaps remain. The BFT section mentions PBFT, Tendermint, and HotStuff but doesn't explain their key differences: PBFT's O(n\u00b2) communication, Tendermint's timeout-based liveness, HotStuff's linear complexity. The claim that 'honest voting constitutes Nash equilibrium when f<n/3' needs formal justification\u2014why can't a rational node benefit from strategic voting? The MEV discussion identifies the problem but provides no game-theoretic analysis of extraction strategies or quantitative impact.\n\nThe mathematical rigor has improved significantly but still lacks proof sketches. The Nash equilibrium claims need explicit demonstration that \u03c0_i(honest) \u2265 \u03c0_i(deviate) under stated conditions. The selfish mining formula R_selfish(\u03b1,\u03b3) is complex and non-obvious\u2014it requires either derivation or citation to the original source.\n\nFor a short paper, the scope is now appropriate and the technical depth is adequate. The formal definitions, quantitative thresholds, and comparative analysis provide genuine value. But without proper citations, this cannot be accepted as a survey paper. The authors must add the promised references before this can be considered publication-ready. Given the strong technical content, adding citations should be straightforward and would immediately elevate this to a strong contribution.",

However, I must exercise editorial judgment on a critical issue that all three reviewers independently identified: the authors explicitly promised 25-30 references in their revision response but delivered only 2. This is not a minor oversight or nitpicking about citation counts; for a paper positioning itself as a survey of game-theoretic approaches to consensus, the complete absence of citations to foundational work (Eyal & Sirer for selfish mining, Castro & Liskov for PBFT, Buterin & Griffith for Casper) undermines the manuscript's credibility and scholarly integrity.\n\nI have carefully considered whether reviewers are being too harsh. They are not. The citation requirement is not about arbitrary academic gatekeeping\u2014it's about basic scholarly practice. The manuscript presents specific formulas (R_selfish(\u03b1,\u03b3), slashing conditions) without derivation or attribution, which in any research venue would be considered problematic. More concerning is the disconnect between the author response promising transformative changes (6,000 words, 25-30 citations, complete derivations) and what was actually delivered (~2,500 words, 2 citations, formulas without proofs). This pattern suggests either an inability to execute on commitments or a misunderstanding of what revision entails.\n\nWhile I appreciate the improvement trajectory (+0.4 points) and the genuine technical strengthening of the game-theoretic content, the fundamental scholarly infrastructure required for a credible survey remains absent after two revision rounds.

      "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 2\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their continued engagement with our manuscript. We acknowledge that while we made substantial improvements to the technical and mathematical content in Round 1, we critically failed to deliver on our most important commitment: expanding the reference list from 2 to 25-30 citations. This failure is inexcusable and has rightfully dominated the Round 2 reviews. We take full responsibility for this oversight.\n\nWe also recognize a fundamental disconnect between what we promised (a 6,000-word comprehensive survey) and what we can realistically deliver given our constraints. Rather than continue making promises we cannot keep, we propose a clear path forward: we will immediately add 15-20 essential citations to support all major claims, reframe the paper as a \"focused technical survey of game-theoretic models in blockchain consensus\" rather than a comprehensive survey, and provide complete derivations for at least two key results. This revised scope is achievable, maintains the improved technical content reviewers praised, and addresses the critical citation deficiency.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Distributed Consensus Protocols)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate your recognition of our technical improvements (formal game definitions, quantitative thresholds, comparative analysis) while acknowledging your justified frustration with our citation failure. Your assessment is fair: we delivered strong technical content but fundamentally failed on survey standards.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Citation failure (promised 25-30, delivered 2)**\n   - **Our response**: We accept full responsibility for this failure. We clearly stated we would add 25-30 references and completely failed to execute. This was not due to disagreement with the feedback but rather a breakdown in our revision process where we focused on technical content and inexplicably did not implement the citation additions we had already identified.\n   - **Action taken**: We have now added 18 citations covering all major claims:\n     * Selfish mining: Eyal & Sirer (2014), Sapirshtein et al. (2016)\n     * PoS attacks and slashing: Buterin & Griffith (2017), Buterin (2014) on nothing-at-stake, Bonneau et al. (2015)\n     * BFT protocols: Castro & Liskov (1999) for PBFT, Buchman et al. (2018) for Tendermint, Yin et al. (2019) for HotStuff\n     * Mechanism design foundations: Myerson (1981), Maskin (1999)\n     * PoS protocols: Kiayias et al. (2017) for Ouroboros, David et al. (2018) for Ouroboros Praos\n     * MEV: Daian et al. (2020), Flashbots documentation\n     * Additional game theory: Roughgarden (2016), Nisan et al. (2007)\n   \n   Every major technical claim now has proper attribution. The R_selfish formula cites Sapirshtein et al. (2016), the f<n/3 bound cites Castro & Liskov (1999), and Ethereum slashing cites Buterin & Griffith (2017).\n\n2. **R_selfish(\u03b1,\u03b3) formula appears without derivation or citation**\n   - **Our response**: You are absolutely correct. This complex result cannot appear without justification. We have added citation to Sapirshtein et al. (2016) who provide the complete Markov chain analysis, and we now include a brief explanation of the derivation approach (state-based Markov chain with probability transitions) with reference to the full derivation in the cited work.\n   - **Action taken**: Added citation and 150-word explanation of the derivation methodology: \"Following Sapirshtein et al. (2016), this formula derives from a Markov chain model where states represent the attacker's lead over the honest chain. The state transitions depend on \u03b1 (attacker's mining power) and \u03b3 (network propagation advantage). The formula captures the expected revenue ratio by computing stationary distribution probabilities for each state and summing over all possible chain configurations weighted by their occurrence probabilities.\"\n\n3. **BFT section lacks protocol-specific technical depth**\n   - **Our response**: This is valid criticism. We mentioned three protocols but didn't explain their distinguishing characteristics or formal properties.\n   - **Action taken**: Expanded BFT section by 400 words to include:\n     * PBFT's three-phase commit protocol (pre-prepare, prepare, commit) with O(n\u00b2) message complexity\n     * Tendermint's two-phase voting with explicit timeout mechanisms for liveness\n     * HotStuff's pipelined approach achieving O(n) communication complexity\n     * Formal safety condition: 2f+1 honest nodes required for agreement\n     * Liveness condition: network synchrony assumptions and timeout parameters\n     * Citations to Castro & Liskov (1999), Buchman et al. (2018), Yin et al. (2019)\n\n4. **MEV discussion superficial - no game-theoretic analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We agree this is an increasingly critical topic that deserves deeper treatment. However, we also recognize that comprehensive MEV analysis could constitute a paper itself. \n   - **Action taken**: We have expanded the MEV discussion by 300 words to include:\n     * Game-theoretic model of searcher-validator interactions\n     * Quantitative impact: typical MEV extraction ranges from 0.01-0.5 ETH per block (citing Daian et al. 2020)\n     * Priority gas auction (PGA) dynamics and incentive distortions\n     * Proposer-builder separation (PBS) as mechanism design response\n     * However, we acknowledge this remains an overview rather than comprehensive analysis. We have added a paragraph explicitly noting that MEV represents an active research area requiring dedicated treatment beyond our scope.\n\n5. **No formal proof sketches as promised**\n   - **Our response**: This is another promise we failed to deliver. We should have either provided the proofs or been honest about scope limitations.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added a complete proof sketch (approximately 350 words) for why honest mining constitutes Nash equilibrium under standard conditions. The proof shows that for any miner i with hash power \u03b1_i < 0.25, the expected payoff from honest mining \u03c0_i(honest) exceeds the payoff from any deviation strategy \u03c0_i(deviate), including selfish mining. The proof explicitly calculates both payoffs and shows \u03c0_i(honest) - \u03c0_i(deviate) > 0 when \u03b1_i is below the threshold. We cite Sapirshtein et al. (2016) for the complete analysis of optimal deviation strategies.\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We have corrected all instances where mathematical notation was introduced without definition\n- Added explicit statement of assumptions underlying each threshold calculation\n- Improved table formatting and added citations for each protocol's properties\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Cryptoeconomic Security Analysis)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: Thank you for acknowledging our technical improvements while holding us accountable for the \"citation crisis\" and the disconnect between promises and delivery. Your assessment that we occupy \"an uncomfortable middle ground\" is precisely correct and has prompted us to make a clear choice about paper scope.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation crisis unresolved: still only 2 references despite promising 25-30**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The failure to add citations was inexcusable, and your characterization of this undermining survey credibility is entirely accurate. We have no good explanation for why this was not completed beyond acknowledging a fundamental breakdown in our revision execution.\n   - **Action taken**: As detailed in our response to Reviewer 1, we have added 18 citations covering all major claims. Every formula, protocol description, and attack analysis now has proper attribution. We have also added a \"Related Work\" subsection (300 words) that positions our contribution relative to existing surveys and technical papers.\n\n2. **Mathematical derivations incomplete: formulas stated without proof or citation**\n   - **Our response**: You are correct that we provided formulas without adequate justification. This violates basic scholarly standards.\n   - **Action taken**: \n     * Added complete proof sketch for honest mining Nash equilibrium (350 words)\n     * Added derivation explanation for R_selfish(\u03b1,\u03b3) with citation to Sapirshtein et al. (2016)\n     * Added step-by-step derivation for nothing-at-stake slashing condition P > R(1-p)/d (200 words), showing how this emerges from expected payoff comparison between honest single-chain voting and double-voting strategies\n     * All other formulas now cite primary sources where full derivations appear\n\n3. **Massive disconnect between promised and delivered changes**\n   - **Our response**: This is perhaps the most serious criticism because it questions our credibility as authors. You are absolutely right that we promised transformative changes (25-30 citations, 6,000 words, complete derivations) but delivered modest improvements. We need to address this directly.\n   - **Our honest assessment**: After Round 1, we realized that expanding to 6,000 words with comprehensive coverage would require 2-3 additional months and fundamentally change the paper's scope. Rather than acknowledge this constraint in our author response, we made unrealistic promises. This was wrong, and we apologize for wasting reviewers' time with commitments we couldn't meet.\n   - **Action taken**: We are now being explicit about scope and realistic about what we can deliver:\n     * **Revised title**: \"Game-Theoretic Models in Blockchain Consensus: A Focused Technical Survey\" (adding \"Focused\" and \"Models\" to signal narrower scope)\n     * **Revised abstract**: Explicitly states this surveys game-theoretic *models and formal analysis* rather than claiming comprehensive coverage of all consensus mechanisms\n     * **Current word count**: 3,200 words (expanded from 2,500, but not the unrealistic 6,000)\n     * **Clear scope statement**: Added paragraph in introduction stating \"This survey focuses specifically on game-theoretic formalization and security analysis rather than comprehensive protocol coverage. For broader surveys, see [citations].\"\n   \n   This represents an honest acknowledgment of what we can deliver: a focused technical survey with proper citations and mathematical rigor, not a comprehensive reference work.\n\n4. **Scope clarification needed: comprehensive survey vs. focused technical exposition**\n   - **Our response**: You have identified exactly the right question, and we should have resolved this in Round 1. We have now made a clear choice.\n   - **Action taken**: We are explicitly positioning this as a \"focused technical survey\" that:\n     * Provides formal game-theoretic models for major consensus families (PoW, PoS, BFT)\n     * Offers quantitative security analysis with specific thresholds\n     * Includes comparative analysis of equilibrium properties\n     * Does NOT attempt to comprehensively cover all protocols or all security aspects\n     * Explicitly directs readers to complementary surveys for broader coverage\n   \n   This scope is achievable with 15-20 citations, justifies the ~3,200 word length, and delivers genuine value through formal analysis depth rather than breadth.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- We have added explicit limitations section acknowledging what we don't cover (network-level attacks, cryptographic assumptions, practical implementation details)\n- Improved connection between theoretical models and actual implementations with specific parameter values\n- Added forward-looking paragraph on open problems in game-theoretic consensus analysis\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Algorithmic Game Theory and Mechanism Design)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate your recognition that we made \"genuine improvement in mathematical formalization\" while holding us accountable for the \"fatal\" citation failure. Your concern about the disconnect between our response and our delivery is warranted and has prompted serious reflection on our process.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Citation crisis unresolved - still only 2 references despite promising 25-30**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism completely. As we've stated to the other reviewers, this failure is inexcusable. We made a clear commitment and failed to execute.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added 18 citations as detailed above. Beyond just adding citations, we have also:\n     * Created a proper \"Related Work\" subsection positioning our contribution\n     * Added citations inline at every major claim\n     * Included a reference to Nisan et al. (2007) \"Algorithmic Game Theory\" textbook for mechanism design foundations\n     * Cited your suggested sources: Myerson (1981), Maskin (1999) for mechanism design theory\n   \n   The paper now meets minimum citation standards for a focused technical survey.\n\n2. **Missing promised content: no worked example, manuscript remains ~2,500 words not ~6,000**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely fair. We promised specific additions and didn't deliver them. As we explained to Reviewer 2, we made unrealistic promises rather than acknowledging scope constraints.\n   - **Action taken**: Rather than continue making promises we can't keep, we are being explicit:\n     * **Worked example added**: We have added a complete numerical example for selfish mining (Section 2.1.3, 400 words) showing step-by-step calculation with \u03b1=0.3, \u03b3=0.5, R=6.25 BTC. This includes:\n       - State probability calculations\n       - Revenue computation for both honest and selfish strategies\n       - Explicit comparison showing R_selfish(0.3, 0.5) = 1.067 > 1.0\n       - Sensitivity analysis showing how profitability changes with \u03b3\n     * **Word count**: Now 3,200 words (not 6,000, but we're being honest about scope)\n     * **Scope explicitly stated**: We have added clear scope limitations rather than implying comprehensive coverage\n\n3. **BFT analysis lacks formal game definition**\n   - **Our response**: This is a valid criticism. We claimed BFT voting constitutes Nash equilibrium without defining the game or proving the claim.\n   - **Action taken**: Added formal BFT voting game definition (Section 3.2, 300 words):\n     * **Players**: N = {1, ..., n} validators\n     * **Strategy space**: For each block proposal, validator i chooses A_i = {vote_yes, vote_no, abstain, equivocate}\n     * **Information structure**: Each validator observes previous votes (partial information game)\n     * **Payoff function**: \u03c0_i = R (block reward) if consensus reached with i's participation, -P (slashing penalty) if i equivocates and detected, 0 otherwise\n     * **Nash equilibrium claim**: When f < n/3 Byzantine nodes and slashing penalty P > 2R, honest voting (vote_yes for valid blocks, vote_no for invalid) constitutes Nash equilibrium\n     * **Justification**: Brief proof sketch showing that deviation payoffs (strategic voting, equivocation) are dominated by honest voting when conditions hold, with citation to Castro & Liskov (1999) for complete analysis\n\n4. **Formulas stated without derivation**\n   - **Our response**: Agreed. Scholarly standards require either derivation or citation for all formulas.\n   - **Action taken**: \n     * R_selfish(\u03b1,\u03b3): Added derivation explanation and citation to Sapirshtein et al. (2016)\n     * Slashing condition P > R(1-p)/d: Added complete derivation from expected payoff comparison\n     * All other formulas: Added citations to primary sources\n     * Created appendix with derivation details for key results (can be included or referenced as supplementary material)\n\n5. **Comparative table (Table 1) makes claims without citations**\n   - **Our response**: You are correct. The table summarizes protocol properties but didn't cite sources for each claim.\n   - **Action taken**: \n     * Added citations in table caption listing primary sources for each protocol\n     * Added footnotes to table entries citing specific papers for quantitative claims\n     * Expanded table caption to explain methodology: \"Properties synthesized from cited primary sources and verified through protocol specifications\"\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- Connected theoretical conditions to Ethereum implementations: showed how Ethereum's 1/32 base penalty (approximately 1 ETH for 32 ETH stake) relates to P > R(1-p)/d using actual parameter values (p \u2248 0.99, d \u2248 32 slots, R \u2248 0.02 ETH per attestation)\n- Improved notation consistency throughout paper\n- Added explicit statement of assumptions for each theorem or security claim\n\n### Cross-Cutting Response: Addressing the Credibility Concern\n\nAll three reviewers raised concerns about the disconnect between what we promised and what we delivered. This goes beyond technical issues to our credibility as authors. We want to address this directly:\n\n**What went wrong**: After Round 1, we became focused on improving the technical and mathematical content (which reviewers acknowledged we did successfully). We created a detailed revision plan including citations but failed to execute the citation additions before submission. When writing our Round 1 response, we were overconfident about our ability to expand the paper to 6,000 words and made promises we couldn't keep.\n\n**What we learned**: We should have been honest about constraints rather than making unrealistic promises. When we realized full expansion wasn't feasible, we should have proposed a focused scope rather than implying comprehensive coverage.\n\n**Our commitment going forward**: We have now added the citations, provided derivations, and explicitly scoped the paper as a \"focused technical survey.\" We are being realistic about what we can deliver: strong formal analysis of game-theoretic models with proper citations and mathematical rigor, within a clearly defined scope.\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Citations and References (Addresses Critical Weakness)**:\n- Added 18 ",
