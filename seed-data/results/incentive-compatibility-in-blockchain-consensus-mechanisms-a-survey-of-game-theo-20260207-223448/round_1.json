While the paper correctly identifies major attack vectors and incentive challenges, it lacks rigorous treatment of adversarial models, quantitative security-incentive tradeoffs, and formal game-theoretic proofs. The heavy reliance on only two references undermines the survey's comprehensiveness.",

      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Add quantitative analysis of security-incentive tradeoffs: include specific examples of attack profitability thresholds, optimal slashing parameters, or minimum viable security deposits with mathematical formulations",
        "Strengthen adversarial model discussion: explicitly define threat models (Byzantine vs. rational vs. hybrid), analyze coalition formation incentives, and discuss adaptive adversary strategies",
        "Expand citation coverage significantly: a survey should reference seminal works on selfish mining (Eyal & Sirer), formal PoS analyses (Buterin, Saleh), MEV literature, and game-theoretic security proofs - the current two-reference approach is inadequate"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptoeconomic security perspective, this paper misses critical analytical depth. The discussion of selfish mining correctly identifies the attack but provides no quantitative analysis of profitability thresholds, network parameter dependencies, or defense mechanisms. The claim that selfish mining is profitable 'well below 50%' needs specific thresholds (e.g., 25% under certain connectivity assumptions). The nothing-at-stake problem is mentioned but without rigorous game-theoretic formalization - where is the payoff matrix, the equilibrium analysis showing why rational validators would deviate?\n\nMost concerning is the absence of formal adversarial models. The paper conflates Byzantine and rational adversaries without clearly distinguishing their capabilities and objectives. Cryptoeconomic security requires explicit threat models: What is the adversary's budget? Are they profit-maximizing or Byzantine? Can they form coalitions? The paper gestures at these issues but never formalizes them. The discussion of slashing mechanisms lacks any quantitative analysis of optimal penalty structures - this is a core cryptoeconomic design question that deserves mathematical treatment.\n\nThe security-incentive tradeoff analysis is superficial. For example, the paper mentions that PoS systems must 'carefully balance' slashing severity against participation risk but provides no framework for this optimization. What is the minimum security deposit required for economic finality? How do we quantify the cost of attacks versus the cost of honest participation? These are fundamental questions in cryptoeconomic security that remain unaddressed.\n\nThe citation strategy is problematic for a survey. Relying primarily on two sources (one from 2015, one from 2019) while marking numerous claims '[citation needed]' suggests either incomplete literature review or awareness that claims lack support. Key works on game-theoretic security (Eyal & Sirer on selfish mining, various formal PoS analyses, the extensive MEV literature) are absent. For a short paper, this might be acceptable if the core analysis were rigorous, but the combination of limited citations and limited analytical depth is concerning.",

The characterization of PoW and PoS is generally accurate but superficial - for instance, the selfish mining discussion mentions profitability 'well below 50%' without citing the actual threshold (approximately 25% under certain network conditions, per Eyal & Sirer). The nothing-at-stake problem is correctly identified, but the paper doesn't explain WHY slashing solves it game-theoretically (it changes the payoff structure to make multi-chain validation dominated). The treatment of Nash equilibria is conceptually sound but never formalized - a survey should at minimum define the strategy space and payoff functions for one consensus game. The '[citation needed]' markers are particularly problematic in sections on formal verification and behavioral economics, suggesting incomplete research. The omission of practical BFT protocols (PBFT, HotStuff, Tendermint) is a significant gap, as these have well-studied game-theoretic properties distinct from PoW/PoS. The paper would benefit from: (1) removing placeholder citations and adding real references, (2) including at least one worked example of equilibrium analysis with mathematical notation, (3) adding a section on BFT-based consensus, and (4) providing quantitative security parameters where known. The writing is clear and well-organized, but the technical content needs substantial strengthening to meet publication standards.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From an algorithmic game theory and mechanism design perspective, this paper exhibits several concerning gaps. First, the treatment of Nash equilibrium is superficial\u2014the paper repeatedly claims protocols achieve Nash equilibrium without formally defining the game, specifying strategy spaces, or proving equilibrium existence. For instance, the statement that 'honest mining constitutes a Nash equilibrium' (Section on PoW) needs formal support: what is the strategy space? What are the payoff functions? Under what information structure? The paper conflates different equilibrium concepts (Nash, subgame perfect, Bayesian) without precision.\n\nThe revelation principle discussion is particularly problematic. The paper states it 'suggests that well-designed protocols should make honest participation a dominant strategy' but this misunderstands the principle's scope. The revelation principle applies to mechanisms where the designer controls the message space and outcome function\u2014blockchain protocols are better modeled as implementation problems in incomplete information settings. The connection between truthful reporting in mechanism design and protocol compliance in blockchains needs much more careful development.\n\nThe incentive compatibility analysis lacks rigor throughout. The paper never formally defines what 'incentive compatible' means in the blockchain context. Is it dominant strategy IC? Bayesian IC? Ex-post Nash? The distinction matters enormously. For selfish mining, the paper should formally show the deviation payoff exceeds the honest payoff under specified conditions, not just assert profitability.\n\nThe citation practices are unacceptable for a technical survey. Seven instances of '[citation needed]' appear in a short paper, including for fundamental claims about formal verification and the revelation principle. This suggests the authors are making assertions beyond what their two primary sources support. A survey should comprehensively cite the literature\u2014where are references to Eyal & Sirer (2014) on selfish mining, Kiayias et al. on Ouroboros, Buterin & Griffith on Casper FFG, or foundational mechanism design work by Myerson, Maskin, or Hurwicz?\n\nThe paper would benefit from at least one concrete example with mathematical detail. For instance, formally model the selfish mining game: define states (public chain length, private chain length), actions (mine on public/private, release blocks), transition probabilities, and payoffs. Then characterize when deviation is profitable. This would demonstrate actual game-theoretic analysis rather than just describing it.\n\nFinally, the paper lacks any novel contribution. For a survey, this might be acceptable, but the paper should then be more comprehensive in its coverage and more rigorous in its synthesis. As written, it reads more like a term paper summarizing two sources rather than an authoritative survey of the field.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript attempts to survey game-theoretic approaches to blockchain consensus mechanisms, and reviewers consistently acknowledge its clear organizational structure and accurate identification of key concepts (selfish mining, nothing-at-stake, incentive compatibility). However, all three reviewers converge on a fundamental problem that I find substantive rather than nitpicking: the paper relies on only two references while containing multiple '[citation needed]' placeholders. For a survey paper\u2014even a short one\u2014this is a significant methodological flaw, not a minor presentation issue. A survey's core value proposition is synthesizing and organizing existing literature; incomplete citations undermine this fundamental purpose.\n\nThe reviewers' demands for mathematical formalization and quantitative analysis are calibrated appropriately for a paper that explicitly invokes game-theoretic concepts like Nash equilibrium and incentive compatibility. When a paper claims to analyze these concepts, readers reasonably expect at least one formal game definition or worked example. This isn't demanding theoretical novelty\u2014it's asking for technical precision commensurate with the paper's own framing. That said, I note some reviewer suggestions (e.g., 'add 8-12 more targeted references,' 'include comparative tables') may be aspirational rather than strictly required for a short survey.\n\nGiven this is Round 1 of 2, major revision is appropriate. The core issues\u2014incomplete citations and lack of any formal treatment\u2014are fixable but require substantial work. The paper has a solid structural foundation and identifies the right topics; it needs to deliver on its implicit promises of rigor. I am not rejecting because the organizational clarity and accurate conceptual coverage suggest the authors understand the domain\u2014they simply need to complete the scholarly apparatus that makes a survey credible.",

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback. We appreciate the time and expertise invested in evaluating our manuscript. The reviews reveal consistent themes across all three assessments: (1) inadequate citation coverage for a survey paper, (2) lack of mathematical formalization and rigor in game-theoretic analysis, (3) absence of quantitative security parameters and thresholds, and (4) missing coverage of important protocol families and formal models.\n\nWe acknowledge these are fundamental weaknesses that significantly limit the contribution of our work. Rather than attempting incremental improvements, we propose a substantial revision that transforms this from a brief overview into a rigorous technical survey. Our revision strategy includes: expanding the reference list from 2 to approximately 25-30 targeted citations covering seminal works and recent advances; adding formal mathematical definitions and at least two worked examples with complete game-theoretic analysis; incorporating quantitative security thresholds and economic parameters throughout; and expanding coverage to include BFT protocols and hybrid consensus mechanisms. We address each reviewer's specific concerns below.\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Cryptoeconomic Security Analysis)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We accept the 4.8/10 average score and agree that our treatment of cryptoeconomic security lacks the analytical depth required for a technical survey. The reviewer correctly identifies that we gesture at important concepts without formalizing them.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Insufficient quantitative security-incentive tradeoff analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We fully agree this is a critical gap. The reviewer is correct that we mention concepts like \"careful balancing\" without providing the mathematical framework for optimization.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new dedicated section (2.5 pages) on \"Quantitative Security Analysis\" that includes:\n     * Formal definition of economic security as the cost to attack a system\n     * Mathematical formulation of the selfish mining profitability threshold (following Eyal & Sirer 2014, Sapirshtein et al. 2016)\n     * Analysis of optimal slashing parameters using the framework from Buterin & Griffith (2017) and Saleh (2021), including the tradeoff between deterrence and participation costs\n     * Minimum viable security deposit calculations for economic finality\n     * Concrete numerical examples showing attack cost vs. reward under different parameter settings\n\n2. **Weak adversarial modeling**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer makes an excellent point that we conflate Byzantine and rational adversaries without proper distinction. This is a fundamental error in cryptoeconomic analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 3.1 \"Adversarial Models in Blockchain Consensus\" (1.5 pages) that:\n     * Formally defines Byzantine adversaries (arbitrary behavior, unbounded computational power within limits)\n     * Formally defines rational adversaries (profit-maximizing, strategic behavior)\n     * Introduces the Byzantine-rational hybrid model from Garay et al. (2015)\n     * Analyzes coalition formation dynamics using coalition game theory\n     * Discusses adaptive adversaries who learn and adjust strategies\n     * Explicitly states threat model assumptions for each protocol discussed\n\n3. **Over-reliance on two references with multiple '[citation needed]' markers**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism without reservation. This is unacceptable for a survey paper and undermines our credibility.\n   - **Action taken**: We will:\n     * Remove all '[citation needed]' placeholders\u2014claims without support will be either properly cited or removed\n     * Expand references to include: Eyal & Sirer (2014) on selfish mining, Sapirshtein et al. (2016) on optimal selfish mining, Buterin & Griffith (2017) on Casper FFG, Saleh (2021) on PoS analysis, Daian et al. (2019) on MEV, Bonneau et al. (2015) on PoS attacks, Kiayias et al. (2017) on Ouroboros, Garay et al. (2015) on Bitcoin backbone protocol\n     * Add approximately 20-25 additional targeted references covering game-theoretic security proofs, formal analyses, and cryptoeconomic mechanism design\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We will add specific quantitative thresholds throughout (e.g., 25% for selfish mining under certain connectivity assumptions rather than vague \"well below 50%\")\n- We will include payoff matrices for key games (nothing-at-stake, validator coordination)\n- We will formalize the equilibrium analysis showing why rational validators would deviate in nothing-at-stake scenarios\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Distributed Consensus Protocols)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the 5.7/10 score and acknowledge that while our high-level characterizations are accurate, we lack the technical precision expected even in a short survey.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Critical under-citation problem**\n   - **Our response**: We agree completely. The reviewer's point that this \"undermines credibility as a survey\" is well-taken.\n   - **Action taken**: As outlined above, we will expand to 25-30 references. Specifically for consensus protocols, we will add: Castro & Liskov (1999) on PBFT, Buchman et al. (2016) on Tendermint, Yin et al. (2019) on HotStuff, Gilad et al. (2017) on Algorand, and Abraham et al. (2017) on recent BFT advances.\n\n2. **Lacks technical rigor\u2014no formal definitions or mathematical characterization**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we describe equilibria without defining them. This is a fundamental weakness.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 2.2 \"Formal Game Models\" (2 pages) containing:\n     * Complete formal definition of the mining game: state space S = {(h_pub, h_priv, blocks_withheld)}, action space A = {mine_public, mine_private, release_k_blocks}, transition function T, and payoff function \u03c0 based on block rewards and network propagation\n     * Formal characterization of Nash equilibrium for honest mining: show that no miner can increase expected payoff by unilateral deviation given honest strategies by others\n     * Mathematical proof sketch showing when selfish mining becomes profitable (deviation payoff > honest payoff)\n     * For PoS: formal definition of the validator game with strategy space including attestation choices and slashing penalties\n     * Explicit equilibrium analysis for the nothing-at-stake problem with payoff matrix showing why multi-chain validation dominates without slashing\n\n3. **Missing coverage of BFT variants and DAG-based protocols**\n   - **Our response**: We agree this is a significant gap. These protocols have distinct game-theoretic properties worth analyzing.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 4 \"Beyond PoW and PoS: Alternative Consensus Mechanisms\" (2 pages) covering:\n     * BFT-based protocols (PBFT, Tendermint, HotStuff): game-theoretic properties of leader-based consensus, incentive compatibility challenges\n     * DAG-based protocols (IOTA, Hashgraph): game-theoretic implications of parallel block production\n     * Comparative analysis of incentive structures across protocol families\n\n4. **Insufficient depth on key technical details**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer's specific examples (selfish mining threshold, specific slashing mechanisms) highlight where we need concrete detail.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add:\n     * Detailed analysis of selfish mining profitability: mathematical derivation showing threshold \u2248 25% under \u03b3=0.5 (equal propagation), with sensitivity analysis for different network parameters\n     * Specific slashing mechanisms from deployed systems: Ethereum 2.0's inactivity leak, Cosmos's evidence-based slashing, with game-theoretic analysis of deterrence effectiveness\n     * Comparative table (as suggested) summarizing equilibrium types, attack vectors, and quantitative thresholds across protocol families\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We will remove all '[citation needed]' markers and replace with actual citations\n- We will add the comparative table as Table 1 in Section 3\n- We will expand the nothing-at-stake discussion to explain specific protocol solutions mechanistically\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Algorithmic Game Theory and Mechanism Design)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We accept the 4.8/10 score and acknowledge the \"concerning gaps\" in our mechanism design analysis. The reviewer's expertise in this area is evident, and their criticisms are particularly valuable.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Lacks mathematical formalization of games**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is absolutely correct. We claim to analyze Nash equilibria without defining the games\u2014this is methodologically unsound.\n   - **Action taken**: As described for Reviewer 2, we will add complete formal game definitions. Specifically:\n     * Mining game: G = (N, S, A, T, \u03c0) where N = {miners}, S = state space (chain configurations), A = action space (mining/release decisions), T = transition probabilities, \u03c0 = payoff functions mapping outcomes to rewards\n     * Nash equilibrium definition: A strategy profile \u03c3* where \u03c0_i(\u03c3*) \u2265 \u03c0_i(\u03c3_i', \u03c3*_{-i}) for all i and all alternative strategies \u03c3_i'\n     * Formal proof that honest mining is Nash equilibrium under certain conditions\n     * Explicit utility functions incorporating block rewards, transaction fees, and costs\n\n2. **Misapplication of revelation principle**\n   - **Our response**: We appreciate this correction. The reviewer is right that we misunderstand the principle's scope and its connection to blockchain protocols.\n   - **Action taken**: We will:\n     * Revise Section 5.2 to correctly explain the revelation principle in its proper context (mechanisms where designers control message spaces and outcome functions)\n     * Clarify that blockchain protocols are better modeled as implementation problems in incomplete information settings\n     * Remove the oversimplified claim about dominant strategies\n     * Add proper discussion of mechanism design challenges in decentralized settings where no single party controls the mechanism\n     * Cite foundational mechanism design literature (Myerson 1981, Maskin 1999) for proper context\n\n3. **Imprecise incentive compatibility claims**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we never formally define what \"incentive compatible\" means in our context and conflate different equilibrium concepts.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 5.1 \"Incentive Compatibility in Blockchain Protocols\" (1.5 pages) that:\n     * Defines dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC): reporting truth/following protocol maximizes utility regardless of others' actions\n     * Defines Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC): following protocol maximizes expected utility given beliefs about others\n     * Defines ex-post Nash equilibrium: following protocol is best response given others follow protocol\n     * Clarifies which concept applies to each protocol discussed\n     * For selfish mining: formally shows deviation payoff exceeds honest payoff under specified conditions using mathematical derivation\n\n4. **Unacceptable citation practices**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism completely. The reviewer's characterization that it \"reads more like a term paper summarizing two sources\" is harsh but fair.\n   - **Action taken**: Beyond expanding general citations, we will specifically add:\n     * Mechanism design foundations: Myerson (1981), Maskin (1999), Hurwicz (1973)\n     * Blockchain-specific game theory: Eyal & Sirer (2014), Kiayias et al. (2017), Buterin & Griffith (2017)\n     * Implementation theory connections: Jackson (1991), Maskin & Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (2002)\n     * All '[citation needed]' markers will be resolved with proper citations or the claims removed\n\n5. **No novel contribution and lacks concrete examples**\n   - **Our response**: We acknowledge that as written, this is a weak survey without novel insights. The reviewer's suggestion for a worked example with mathematical detail is excellent.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add Section 2.3 \"Worked Example: Selfish Mining Game\" (2 pages) containing:\n     * Complete formal model: states (h_pub, h_priv), actions, transition probabilities based on network propagation parameter \u03b3\n     * Payoff calculation: expected rewards as function of mining power \u03b1, propagation \u03b3, and strategy\n     * Mathematical derivation of profitability condition: \u03b1 > \u03b1_threshold where \u03b1_threshold = (1-\u03b3)/(3-2\u03b3) for \u03b3 \u2264 0.5\n     * Numerical examples: show that with \u03b3=0.5, threshold is 25%; with \u03b3=0, threshold is 33%\n     * Discussion of defense mechanisms and their game-theoretic implications\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We will distinguish equilibrium concepts (Nash, subgame perfect, Bayesian) precisely throughout\n- We will add formal strategy space and payoff function definitions for each game discussed\n- We will clarify information structures (complete vs. incomplete information) for each protocol\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Major Structural Revisions:**\n- Expand manuscript from ~2,000 to ~6,000 words to accommodate rigorous technical content\n- Add new Section 2.2 \"Formal Game Models\" with complete mathematical definitions\n- Add new Section 2.3 \"Worked Example: Selfish Mining Game\" with detailed mathematical analysis\n- Add new Section 2.5 \"Quantitative Security Analysis\" covering economic security parameters\n- Add new Section 3.1 \"Adversarial Models\" formally defining threat models\n- Add new Section 4 \"Beyond PoW and PoS\" covering BFT and alternative consensus\n- Add new Section 5.1 \"Incentive Compatibility in Blockchain Protocols\" with precise definitions\n\n**Citation Improvements:**\n- Expand from 2 to 25-30 targeted references covering:\n  * Foundational game theory and mechanism design (Myerson, Maskin, Hurwicz)\n  * Blockchain-specific game-theoretic analyses (Eyal & Sirer, Sapirshtein et al., Saleh)\n  * Consensus protocol papers (Castro & Liskov, Buchman et al., Kiayias et al.)\n  * Cryptoeconomic security (Buterin & Griffith, Bonneau et al., Garay et al.)\n  * MEV and recent advances (Daian et al., Flashbots research)\n- Remove all '[citation needed]' placeholders\n\n**Technical Content Additions:**\n- Add formal game definitions with strategy spaces, payoff functions, and equilibrium characterizations\n- Include quantitative security thresholds (e.g., 25% for selfish mining) throughout\n- Add payoff matrices for key games (nothing-at-stake, validator coordination)\n- Include mathematical derivations for attack profitability conditions\n- Add comparative table summarizing game-theoretic properties across consensus families\n- Provide concrete numerical examples with parameter sensitivity analysis\n\n**Clarifications and Corrections:**\n- Correct misapplication of revelation principle with proper mechanism design context\n- Distinguish Byzantine, rational, and hybrid adversarial models explicitly\n- Clarify incentive compatibility concepts (DSIC, BIC, ex-post Nash) and which applies where\n- Add formal proof sketches for equilibrium claims\n- Explain specific protocol solutions (Casper FFG slashing, checkpointing) mechanistically\n\n**Timeline:**\nWe anticipate completing these revisions within 6-8 weeks given the substantial expansion required. We believe these changes will transform the manuscript into a rigorous technical survey that makes a genuine contribution to the literature by providing comprehensive game-theoretic analysis of blockchain consensus mechanisms with proper mathematical formalization and adequate citation coverage.\n\nWe thank the reviewers again for their invaluable feedback and look forward to submitting a significantly strengthened revision.",
