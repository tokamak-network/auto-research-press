      "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed consensus protocols perspective, this paper demonstrates understanding of high-level concepts but lacks the technical rigor expected even for a short survey. The most critical issue is protocol accuracy and specificity. The paper discusses 'proof-of-stake' generically without distinguishing between chain-based PoS (like Ethereum's Gasper), BFT-based PoS (like Tendermint), or hybrid approaches\u2014each has fundamentally different game-theoretic properties and security models. The nothing-at-stake problem is mentioned but not rigorously analyzed; there's no discussion of weak subjectivity, long-range attacks, or the specific slashing conditions that make modern PoS protocols secure.\n\nThe treatment of consensus families is incomplete. Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocols (PBFT, HotStuff, Tendermint) represent a major family with distinct incentive structures\u2014they achieve deterministic finality but require different assumptions about validator sets and network synchrony. DAG-based protocols (Hashgraph, Avalanche) are entirely absent despite their novel approaches to incentive design. The paper would benefit from a taxonomy that clearly delineates these families and their game-theoretic properties.\n\nRegarding security tradeoffs, the paper makes assertions without quantitative backing. For example, it states that PoW security depends on attack cost exceeding gain, but doesn't analyze the actual economics: what is the cost function for a 51% attack? How does it scale with network hashrate? What about selfish mining thresholds (the critical 25-33% range)? The Bonneau et al. reference [1] actually provides detailed analysis of these tradeoffs that should be summarized.\n\nThe extensive use of '[citation needed]' is particularly problematic for a survey paper. MEV is a well-studied phenomenon with substantial literature (Daian et al., Qin et al., others), yet the paper treats it as if citations don't exist. Similarly, collusion resistance has been analyzed formally in multiple contexts (Eyal's work on miner's dilemma, analysis of pooled mining, cartel formation in PoS). These gaps suggest the survey may not have comprehensively covered the relevant literature.\n\nPositively, the paper correctly identifies incentive compatibility as the central challenge and appropriately frames it using Nash equilibrium concepts. The discussion of mechanism design principles is sound, though it could be more technical. The acknowledgment of implementation challenges and bounded rationality shows good awareness of theory-practice gaps. However, for a consensus protocols expert, this reads more as a general introduction than a rigorous technical survey.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptoeconomic security perspective, this paper has fundamental gaps that prevent it from serving as a reliable survey. The most critical issue is the treatment of attack vectors and adversarial models. The paper mentions selfish mining, nothing-at-stake, and long-range attacks but provides no rigorous analysis of these threats. For example, the selfish mining discussion in the PoW section lacks any mention of the threshold mining power required (typically analyzed as >25% under certain network conditions), the role of network propagation delays, or the actual profitability calculations that determine when this attack is rational. \n\nThe adversarial model is never formally specified. A rigorous cryptoeconomic analysis requires stating assumptions about adversary capabilities: Are we assuming a computationally bounded adversary? What fraction of stake/hashpower can they control? Can they adaptively corrupt validators? Can they manipulate network delays? These questions are fundamental to security analysis but are entirely absent. The paper conflates different security models (Byzantine fault tolerance, rational deviations, coalition attacks) without clearly delineating when each applies.\n\nThe security-incentive tradeoff analysis is particularly weak. The paper states that 'block rewards and transaction fees must be calibrated' but provides no framework for this calibration. What is the minimum reward needed to ensure security? How does this scale with network value? What happens when block rewards decrease over time (as in Bitcoin)? These are central questions in cryptoeconomic security that remain unaddressed. The paper needs quantitative analysis: attack cost vs. attack reward calculations, security margins expressed as ratios, and concrete parameter recommendations.\n\nThe MEV section is especially problematic for a survey paper. MEV represents one of the most significant recent developments in cryptoeconomic security, yet the entire section consists of unsupported claims marked '[citation needed]'. This is unacceptable for a survey\u2014either cite the extensive MEV literature (Flashbots research, academic papers on MEV-Boost, front-running analyses) or remove the section. The same applies to the collusion resistance discussion, which mentions important concepts but provides no citations to the substantial literature on this topic.\n\nThe paper would benefit from incorporating formal security definitions (e.g., chain quality, common prefix, chain growth properties) and proving or citing proofs that specific mechanisms satisfy these properties under stated adversarial assumptions. The current treatment is too informal for rigorous cryptoeconomic analysis. Additionally, the paper should discuss security parameter selection: how to choose block times, confirmation depths, slashing penalties, and other parameters to achieve desired security levels given specific threat models.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a mechanism design perspective, this survey exhibits significant gaps in rigor and technical depth. The paper repeatedly invokes 'incentive compatibility' and 'Nash equilibrium' without providing formal definitions or demonstrating how these concepts apply to the specific mechanisms discussed. For instance, when discussing Bitcoin's proof-of-work, the paper claims it achieves 'a form of incentive compatibility' but never specifies whether this means dominant strategy incentive compatibility, Bayesian incentive compatibility, or ex-post incentive compatibility\u2014distinctions that are fundamental in mechanism design. The treatment of selfish mining mentions that it 'can yield higher returns' but provides no formal analysis of the conditions under which this occurs or the equilibrium structure of the mining game.\n\nThe mechanism design section is particularly weak. It mentions 'reverse game theory' but fails to discuss the revelation principle, which is foundational to mechanism design and highly relevant to consensus protocols. The paper does not address the fundamental tension in mechanism design between incentive compatibility and budget balance\u2014a critical issue for blockchain systems that must be self-sustaining. There is no discussion of implementation theory or the conditions under which desired social choice functions can be implemented in equilibrium.\n\nThe excessive reliance on '[citation needed]' markers (appearing over 20 times) is unacceptable even for a short paper. The entire MEV section, which discusses a significant incentive problem, lacks any citations despite substantial existing literature (Daian et al.'s 'Flash Boys 2.0', Flashbots research, academic work on transaction ordering). This suggests the author is aware of gaps but has not completed the necessary scholarship. Similarly, claims about coalition-proof mechanisms, governance games, and cross-chain incentives are made without support.\n\nThe paper also conflates different equilibrium concepts without precision. It discusses Nash equilibrium but then mentions 'coalition-proof' mechanisms without formally defining coalition-proof Nash equilibrium or strong Nash equilibrium. The treatment of proof-of-stake mechanisms mentions 'slashing conditions' but never analyzes them as mechanism design tools\u2014what game do they induce? What are the equilibrium properties? Under what conditions do they achieve the desired incentive properties?\n\nFor a survey claiming to examine 'game-theoretic approaches,' the paper is surprisingly light on actual game theory. There are no formal game trees, no payoff matrices, no equilibrium calculations, and no proofs or even proof sketches. The discussion remains at a high conceptual level without demonstrating mastery of the technical tools. A stronger paper would include at least one detailed game-theoretic analysis of a specific mechanism, showing explicitly how the equilibrium is derived and what properties it satisfies.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript attempts to survey game-theoretic approaches to blockchain consensus, a topic of genuine importance to both researchers and practitioners. The reviewers consistently praise the paper's clear structure, accessible writing, and logical progression from foundational concepts to advanced topics. However, all three reviewers identify a critical, convergent concern: the manuscript contains 15-20+ '[citation needed]' placeholders throughout sections on MEV, collusion resistance, and attack vectors. This is not a minor presentation issue\u2014it represents incomplete scholarship that fundamentally undermines the paper's credibility as a survey. A survey's core value proposition is synthesizing existing literature; a survey riddled with missing citations fails at its primary function.\n\nThe reviewers' criticisms are substantive and well-calibrated for a survey paper. While some demands (formal proofs, quantitative security bounds) might be excessive for a short survey format, the citation gaps and lack of formal definitions are legitimate concerns that any venue would flag. The reviewers are not demanding groundbreaking novelty\u2014they're asking for basic scholarly completeness. The paper's strengths (clear writing, good structure, appropriate scope acknowledgment) provide a solid foundation, but the current draft reads more like a well-organized outline than a finished survey.\n\nAs this is Round 1 of 2, major revision is appropriate. The author has demonstrated capability in structuring and presenting complex material clearly\u2014the core issues are addressable with dedicated effort. The path to acceptance is clear: complete the literature review, add formal definitions for key concepts, and either properly support or remove the unsupported claims.

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback on our manuscript. We appreciate the time and expertise invested in reviewing our work, and we acknowledge that the reviews have identified significant weaknesses that must be addressed before this manuscript can be considered publication-ready.\n\nThe reviewers have converged on several critical themes: (1) the excessive use of '[citation needed]' placeholders (20+ instances) that fundamentally undermines the credibility of a survey paper; (2) insufficient technical rigor and formal analysis for a game-theoretic survey; (3) lack of depth in analyzing specific consensus protocols and their mechanisms; (4) missing treatment of important protocol families (BFT variants, DAG-based protocols); and (5) superficial discussion of security tradeoffs without quantitative analysis. We accept these criticisms as valid and have undertaken a comprehensive revision to address each concern systematically.\n\nOur revision strategy involves: (1) completing a thorough literature review to replace all '[citation needed]' markers with proper citations or removing unsupported claims; (2) adding formal game-theoretic definitions and at least two detailed protocol analyses with mathematical rigor; (3) including a comparative taxonomy of consensus families with their distinct incentive structures; (4) strengthening security analysis with quantitative attack cost calculations and formal adversarial models; and (5) adding empirical data from actual blockchain systems to ground theoretical claims. We recognize that these revisions represent substantial additional work, but we believe they are necessary to meet the standards expected for publication.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Distributed Consensus Protocols)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 5.2/10 and accept that our manuscript lacks the technical rigor and citation coverage expected for a consensus protocols survey. The reviewer's expertise in this area has identified critical gaps that we will address comprehensively.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Extensive use of '[citation needed]' placeholders undermining credibility**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The presence of 15+ '[citation needed]' markers is unacceptable for a survey paper and reflects incomplete scholarship on our part. We should have either completed the literature review before submission or removed unsupported claims.\n   - **Action taken**: We have conducted a comprehensive literature review and replaced all placeholders with proper citations. Specifically: For MEV, we now cite Daian et al. (2019) \"Flash Boys 2.0,\" Qin et al. (2021) on MEV quantification, and Flashbots research reports. For collusion, we cite Eyal (2015) \"The Miner's Dilemma,\" Bonneau (2016) on mining pool centralization, and recent work on cartel formation in PoS. For layer-2 solutions, we cite specific protocol papers (Lightning Network, Plasma, Optimistic Rollups). We have also removed two claims that we could not adequately support with citations.\n\n2. **Lack of technical depth on specific consensus protocols**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that discussing 'proof-of-stake' generically without distinguishing between fundamentally different implementations is a critical flaw. The reviewer is correct that chain-based PoS (Gasper), BFT-based PoS (Tendermint), and hybrid approaches have distinct game-theoretic properties.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added a new section (2.5 pages) providing detailed analysis of three specific protocols: (a) Ethereum's Gasper (chain-based PoS) with formal analysis of LMD GHOST fork choice, justification/finalization conditions, and the game induced by slashing; (b) Tendermint (BFT-based PoS) with analysis of the two-phase commit protocol, validator rotation, and incentive properties under partial synchrony; (c) Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus with formal selfish mining analysis including threshold calculations. Each analysis includes: formal game definition (players, strategies, payoffs), equilibrium conditions, and known attack vectors with quantitative bounds.\n\n3. **Missing discussion of critical consensus protocol families**\n   - **Our response**: We accept that omitting BFT variants and DAG-based protocols represents a significant gap. These families have fundamentally different incentive structures that warrant discussion even in a short survey.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added Section 4.3 \"Alternative Consensus Families\" (1.5 pages) covering: (a) Classical and modern BFT protocols (PBFT, HotStuff) with analysis of their deterministic finality, view-change mechanisms, and incentive assumptions; (b) DAG-based protocols (Hashgraph, Avalanche) with discussion of their novel approaches to parallel block production and incentive design; (c) A comparative table showing different consensus families with their incentive mechanisms, security assumptions, liveness/safety tradeoffs, and known vulnerabilities. This addition increases the paper length but provides necessary coverage.\n\n4. **Insufficient treatment of security tradeoffs without quantitative analysis**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that we made assertions without quantitative backing. Stating that 'PoW security depends on attack cost exceeding gain' without analyzing actual economics is insufficient.\n   - **Action taken**: We have substantially expanded Section 5 on security tradeoffs (now 2 pages) to include: (a) Quantitative 51% attack analysis with cost functions based on network hashrate, hardware costs, and electricity prices, including worked examples for Bitcoin and smaller chains; (b) Selfish mining threshold analysis showing the critical 25-33% range with formal derivation from Eyal & Sirer (2014); (c) CAP theorem implications for incentive design with discussion of consistency-availability tradeoffs under partition; (d) Formal analysis of safety vs. liveness tradeoffs under different network conditions (synchrony, partial synchrony, asynchrony) and their impact on incentive structures; (e) Security margin calculations expressing attack cost vs. network value ratios for different mechanisms.\n\n5. **Superficial selfish mining discussion**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that mentioning selfish mining without engaging with the extensive literature on optimal mining strategies is inadequate.\n   - **Action taken**: The expanded protocol analysis (point 2 above) now includes a detailed selfish mining section with: formal game-theoretic model showing the state machine and strategy space; threshold analysis proving the >25% profitability bound under certain network conditions; discussion of the role of network propagation delays and connectivity; analysis of optimal mining strategies and the arms race between selfish miners; citations to the full literature including Eyal & Sirer (2014), Sapirshtein et al. (2016) on optimal strategies, and Nayak et al. (2016) on stubborn mining.\n\n**Minor Points**: \n- We have added the formal definition of weak subjectivity and discussion of long-range attacks in the PoS section, with specific slashing conditions that make modern PoS secure.\n- We have clarified the nothing-at-stake problem with formal analysis showing why rational validators would sign multiple chains without penalties.\n- We have added discussion of validator set assumptions and network synchrony requirements for different BFT protocols.\n- The Bonneau et al. [1] reference is now used more extensively with specific page citations to their analysis of attack economics and security tradeoffs.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Cryptoeconomic Security Analysis)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 4.8/10 and accept that our manuscript has fundamental gaps in cryptoeconomic security analysis. The lack of formal adversarial models and rigorous security-incentive tradeoff analysis represents a critical weakness that we will address.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Critical security sections contain numerous '[citation needed]' markers**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism and recognize that incomplete citations in MEV and collusion sections are particularly problematic for a survey claiming to cover cryptoeconomic security.\n   - **Action taken**: As detailed in our response to Reviewer 1, we have completed comprehensive literature review and replaced all '[citation needed]' markers. The MEV section now extensively cites the Flash Boys 2.0 paper, Flashbots research, MEV-Boost analysis, and recent work on PBS (proposer-builder separation). The collusion section cites Eyal's miner's dilemma, pooled mining analysis, and recent work on PoS cartel formation. We have verified that every substantive claim in these sections now has proper citation support.\n\n2. **Adversarial models are never formally defined or rigorously analyzed**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is absolutely correct that we conflated different security models (Byzantine fault tolerance, rational deviations, coalition attacks) without clearly delineating when each applies. This is a fundamental flaw for a cryptoeconomic security paper.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added a new Section 3 \"Formal Adversarial Models\" (2 pages) that provides: (a) Formal definition of the Byzantine adversary model with specification of adversary capabilities (computational power bounds, stake fraction control, network manipulation abilities); (b) Distinction between static adversaries (fixed corruption set) and adaptive adversaries (dynamic corruption) with discussion of when each model applies; (c) Rational adversary model where deviations must be profitable, with formal definition of rationality assumptions; (d) Coalition adversary model for analyzing coordinated attacks; (e) For each consensus mechanism discussed, we now explicitly state which adversarial model applies and what fraction of adversarial power can be tolerated (e.g., BFT protocols tolerate f < n/3 Byzantine faults, PoW assumes honest majority hashrate, PoS assumes honest majority stake with specific economic bounds).\n\n3. **Security-incentive tradeoffs discussed superficially without quantitative analysis**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that claiming 'block rewards must be calibrated' without providing a framework for calibration is insufficient. The reviewer's questions about minimum rewards, scaling with network value, and long-term sustainability are central to cryptoeconomic security.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added Section 5.2 \"Quantitative Security-Incentive Analysis\" (2.5 pages) including: (a) Formal framework for reward calibration based on attack cost vs. attack reward, with derivation of minimum security budget as function of network value; (b) Analysis of Bitcoin's long-term security as block rewards decrease, including calculations of when transaction fees must exceed certain thresholds; (c) Security margin analysis expressing attack cost/network value ratios, with concrete examples: Bitcoin's 51% attack cost (~$20B at current prices) vs. market cap, comparison with smaller PoW chains that have been attacked; (d) Parameter selection guidelines for block times, confirmation depths, and slashing penalties based on desired security levels and threat models; (e) Worked examples with numerical calculations showing security-incentive tradeoffs for specific parameter choices.\n\n4. **Missing analysis of concrete attack vectors**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that mentioning attacks without rigorous analysis is inadequate. Eclipse attacks, timejacking, and network-level attacks all affect incentive structures and should be covered.\n   - **Action taken**: We have expanded Section 6 \"Attack Vectors and Defenses\" (2 pages) to include: (a) Selfish mining with detailed analysis (as described in response to Reviewer 1); (b) Eclipse attacks with analysis of how network isolation affects consensus incentives and enables double-spending; (c) Timejacking and timestamp manipulation attacks with game-theoretic analysis; (d) Network-level attacks (partitioning, delay attacks) and their impact on consensus safety and liveness; (e) For each attack, we provide: formal description of attacker strategy, conditions under which attack is profitable, quantitative analysis of attack cost and success probability, and defensive mechanisms with their incentive properties.\n\n5. **Paper claims to be a 'survey' but relies on only 2-3 core references**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. A survey should comprehensively cover relevant literature, not rely primarily on a single foundational reference (Bonneau et al.).\n   - **Action taken**: We have expanded our reference list from 8 citations to 47 citations, covering: foundational game theory and mechanism design papers, original consensus protocol papers (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tendermint, etc.), security analysis papers (selfish mining, nothing-at-stake, long-range attacks), MEV literature (Daian et al., Flashbots research, recent PBS work), collusion and cartel analysis, empirical studies of actual attacks, and recent developments in layer-2 and cross-chain systems. Each section now cites multiple relevant papers rather than relying on one or two core references.\n\n**Minor Points**:\n- We have added formal security definitions (chain quality, common prefix, chain growth) in Section 3.1 with citations to the formal analysis literature.\n- We have included empirical attack data: documented 51% attacks on smaller chains (Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold) with cost analysis and lessons learned.\n- We have added discussion of MEV extraction statistics from Flashbots data to ground theoretical analysis in reality.\n- The security parameter selection discussion now includes concrete recommendations based on threat models and desired security levels.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Algorithmic Game Theory and Mechanism Design)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We acknowledge the score of 4.8/10 and accept that our manuscript lacks the technical rigor expected for a paper claiming to survey 'game-theoretic approaches.' The absence of formal game-theoretic definitions and analysis is a critical omission that we will address comprehensively.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Lacks formal game-theoretic definitions and analysis**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is absolutely correct that a paper surveying 'game-theoretic approaches' must provide formal definitions of Nash equilibrium, incentive compatibility, and the games being analyzed. Our failure to do so represents a fundamental gap.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added Section 2 \"Game-Theoretic Foundations\" (3 pages) providing: (a) Formal definition of strategic form games (players, strategy spaces, payoff functions) with application to consensus protocols; (b) Precise definition of Nash equilibrium with distinction between pure and mixed strategy equilibria; (c) Formal definition of incentive compatibility with distinction between dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC), Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC), and ex-post incentive compatibility; (d) Definition of coalition-proof Nash equilibrium and strong Nash equilibrium for analyzing coordinated deviations; (e) For each consensus mechanism discussed in later sections, we now explicitly define the induced game and analyze its equilibrium properties using these formal tools.\n\n2. **Over 20 instances of '[citation needed]' undermining credibility**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism fully and recognize that this represents the most serious flaw in our submission. The reviewer is correct that this indicates incomplete scholarship.\n   - **Action taken**: As detailed in responses to Reviewers 1 and 2, we have completed comprehensive literature review and replaced all '[citation needed]' markers with proper citations (expanding from 8 to 47 references). The MEV section now extensively cites the substantial existing literature. The coalition resistance section cites formal game-theoretic analysis of coalitions in blockchain systems. The governance section cites mechanism design papers on voting and collective decision-making. We have verified that no '[citation needed]' markers remain in the revised manuscript.\n\n3. **Superficial treatment of mechanism design principles**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that we failed to discuss the revelation principle, implementation theory, or distinguish between different notions of incentive compatibility. For a paper claiming to examine mechanism design approaches to consensus, these omissions are critical.\n   - **Action taken**: We have substantially expanded Section 2.3 \"Mechanism Design Principles\" (2.5 pages) to include: (a) The revelation principle and its implications for consensus mechanism design\u2014discussion of when direct mechanisms are sufficient and when they are not (e.g., when computational complexity matters); (b) Implementation theory with analysis of when desired social choice functions can be implemented in equilibrium; (c) Clear distinction between DSIC and BIC with discussion of when each is appropriate for blockchain consensus (DSIC is ideal but often impossible; BIC may be achievable under common prior assumptions); (d) The fundamental tension between incentive compatibility and budget balance, with analysis of why blockchain systems require external subsidies (block rewards) to achieve incentive compatibility; (e) Discussion of impossibility results from mechanism design and their implications for consensus protocols.\n\n4. **Missing analysis of known impossibility results and limitations**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that discussing mechanism design without addressing fundamental limitations and tradeoffs is incomplete. The CAP theorem's implications for incentive design and the IC-budget balance tension are central issues we should have covered.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added Section 2.4 \"Impossibility Results and Fundamental Limitations\" (1.5 pages) covering: (a) CAP theorem and its implications for incentive design\u2014analysis of how partition tolerance requirements constrain the achievable incentive properties; (b) The impossibility of achieving both perfect incentive compatibility and budget balance without external subsidies, with formal statement and proof sketch; (c) Tradeoffs between different equilibrium concepts\u2014when DSIC is impossible, what weaker properties can be achieved?; (d) Limitations of game-theoretic models in capturing bounded rationality, irrational behavior, and social factors that affect real blockchain systems; (e) The fundamental tension between decentralization (many anonymous participants) and accountability (ability to punish deviations).\n\n5. **Discussion of proof-of-stake mechanisms lacks technical depth**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer is correct that we never formally modeled the nothing-at-stake problem or analyzed slashing conditions as mechanism design tools. This represents a missed opportunity for rigorous game-theoretic analysis.\n   - **Action taken**: We have added detailed game-theoretic analysis",
