The revision successfully addresses most previous cryptographic concerns, particularly around trusted setups, security assumptions, and failure modes. Minor technical refinements and additional formal security analysis would strengthen the work further.",

        "The fraud proof bisection protocol description (Section 2.3) could be more precise about the cryptographic commitments used at each bisection step. The protocol relies on Merkle tree commitments to execution traces, and the security depends on the binding property of these commitments\u2014this should be explicit.",
        "Missing discussion of specific cryptographic vulnerabilities that have affected production ZK rollups. For example, the Polygon zkEVM soundness bug (2023) where circuit constraints were insufficient, or zkSync's PLONK implementation issues. These real-world examples would strengthen the failure mode analysis.",
        "The trusted setup discussion for SNARKs could clarify the multi-party computation (MPC) ceremony structure more precisely. The statement 'one honest participant suffices' is correct but should note that this assumes the MPC protocol itself is correctly implemented and that the honest participant's randomness is truly random and destroyed.",
        "Verification gas costs (250k-300k for SNARKs, 500k-1M for STARKs) are presented as ranges without specifying which implementations or parameter choices yield these values. zkSync's PLONK verification is closer to 400k gas, while Polygon zkEVM's custom SNARK is ~350k. More precision would improve accuracy."

      "suggestions": [
        "Add a subsection on cryptographic parameter choices and their security implications: field sizes for SNARKs (BN254 provides ~100-bit security, not 128-bit; BLS12-381 provides ~128-bit), FRI parameters for STARKs (blowup factor, number of queries), and how these affect proof size vs security trade-offs.",
        "Include formal security definitions for the key cryptographic properties. For example, define computational soundness formally: 'For all probabilistic polynomial-time adversaries A, Pr[A generates accepting proof for false statement] \u2264 negl(\u03bb)' where \u03bb is the security parameter. This would elevate the rigor.",
        "Expand the quantum resistance discussion to quantify the threat timeline. Current estimates suggest large-scale quantum computers capable of breaking 256-bit elliptic curve discrete log may emerge in 15-30 years. This contextualizes the SNARK vs STARK quantum resistance trade-off more concretely.",
        "Add a comparison table of specific proof system implementations used by each rollup (e.g., zkSync uses PLONK with KZG commitments, StarkNet uses FRI-based STARKs with Poseidon hash, Polygon zkEVM uses custom SNARK with Groth16-like structure). This would provide concrete technical grounding."
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic perspective, this manuscript represents a significant improvement over previous versions. The treatment of proof systems is now technically accurate, with proper distinction between SNARKs and STARKs, correct identification of security assumptions, and appropriate caveats about trusted setups and quantum resistance. The security model analysis correctly distinguishes economic security (fraud proofs with 1-of-N honesty) from cryptographic security (validity proofs with computational soundness), which is fundamental to understanding rollup trust models.\n\nHowever, several areas could benefit from additional cryptographic rigor. First, the fraud proof mechanism would be strengthened by explicitly describing the Merkle commitment structure used in bisection protocols\u2014security relies on the binding property of these commitments, and adversaries cannot equivocate about intermediate execution states. Second, the trusted setup discussion, while improved, should clarify that PLONK's universal setup means the same setup can be reused across different circuits (unlike Groth16's circuit-specific setup), but the setup ceremony itself still requires careful MPC protocol execution. Third, the verification gas costs should be tied to specific implementations and parameter choices rather than broad ranges, as these vary significantly based on proof system configuration.\n\nThe manuscript would also benefit from discussing concrete cryptographic vulnerabilities that have affected production systems. The Polygon zkEVM soundness bug (where under-constrained circuits allowed invalid state transitions) and various PLONK implementation issues in zkSync demonstrate that proof system security depends not just on theoretical properties but on correct implementation. These examples would ground the failure mode analysis in reality.\n\nFinally, the treatment of proof recursion is good but could be expanded to discuss the specific recursive composition techniques used (e.g., cycle of curves for SNARK recursion, FRI-based recursion for STARKs) and their security implications. Recursive proof composition introduces additional assumptions\u2014the outer proof system must be able to efficiently verify the inner proof system, which constrains cryptographic choices.\n\nOverall, this is strong work that demonstrates solid understanding of rollup cryptography. The suggested refinements would elevate it from a good technical analysis to a rigorous cryptographic treatment suitable for academic publication or technical standards documentation.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems perspective, this revision shows substantial improvement in architectural rigor. The bottleneck analysis correctly identifies that current L2s are demand-limited rather than infrastructure-limited, which is critical for understanding scalability headroom. The cryptographic security comparison between fraud proofs and validity proofs properly frames the fundamental trade-off between liveness-favoring (optimistic) and safety-favoring (ZK) designs - this is the classic availability vs. consistency tension from distributed systems theory.\n\nHowever, several areas need more rigorous treatment. The latency measurements lack statistical rigor - distributed systems require percentile analysis, not just ranges. The '200-500ms' sequencer confirmation time likely has a long tail under load that significantly impacts user experience. The blob propagation analysis (12-36 seconds) doesn't account for network topology effects or validator bandwidth heterogeneity, which are critical in gossip-based systems. You need p95/p99 latencies under different blob utilization levels.\n\nThe cross-rollup atomicity analysis is excellent and addresses a critical gap, but it needs deeper treatment of failure recovery. What happens when a cross-rollup transaction fails mid-execution? Are there timeout mechanisms? How do you handle partial state commitment? The 7-day bridge latency for optimistic rollups creates a massive coordination problem that deserves formal analysis of failure modes and recovery protocols.\n\nThe throughput bottleneck tables are valuable, but they need empirical validation. The claim that zkSync Era is 'prover-constrained' at 50 TPS needs supporting evidence - what happens at 40 TPS vs. 45 TPS vs. 50 TPS? Do you see proof generation latency increase? Queue buildup? You need degradation curves, not just point estimates. Similarly, the 'sequencer compute' limits of ~2,000 TPS need validation - is this CPU-bound, memory-bound, or I/O-bound? What's the actual resource utilization at current loads?\n\nThe state growth analysis is too simplistic. Linear extrapolation from current growth rates ignores transaction complexity evolution, contract deployment patterns, and state access locality. Real-world state growth is likely sub-linear due to economies of scale in contract reuse, but could be super-linear if transaction complexity increases. You need confidence bounds and sensitivity analysis.\n\nMissing entirely is analysis of sequencer failure modes. Base's centralized sequencer is a single point of failure - what's the failover mechanism? Transaction reorg risk? User impact during downtime? This is fundamental to understanding system reliability. The manuscript would benefit from a formal failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) covering Byzantine failures, crash failures, and network partitions.\n\nThe blob space stress scenario analysis is well-done, but needs more detail on the EIP-1559 dynamics for blobs. The exponential fee increase (12.5% per block above target) will create severe price volatility under sustained demand - this deserves quantitative modeling of fee trajectories under different demand scenarios.\n\nOverall, this is strong work that demonstrates good understanding of L2 architecture and distributed systems principles. With more rigorous empirical validation, formal latency analysis, and deeper treatment of failure modes, this would be publication-quality research. The improvements from previous rounds are evident, particularly in security model analysis and cross-rollup composability.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a mechanism design and tokenomics perspective, this revision demonstrates significantly improved economic reasoning. The MEV decomposition into efficient congestion pricing versus rent extraction is exactly the type of analysis needed - though I'd push for more detail on the econometric methodology (what instruments were used? how was the counterfactual efficient price estimated?). The market concentration explanation now correctly identifies economic mechanisms rather than just observing outcomes, which is crucial for policy recommendations.\n\nHowever, several critical economic sustainability questions remain unaddressed. The most glaring is the incomplete Section 3.4 - without understanding the economics of prover subsidies and path to profitability, we cannot evaluate whether current ZK rollup fee structures represent sustainable equilibria or temporary promotional pricing. StarkNet's $0.002 average fees are presented as 'aggressive subsidies' but there's no analysis of the magnitude of subsidy (dollars per transaction? percentage of true cost?) or exit strategy.\n\nThe sequencer economics section improves with Base's profitability data, but lacks mechanism design depth. Why does Base capture 86.1% of revenue from priority fees while Arbitrum and Optimism don't? Is this a technological difference, a strategic choice, or a market structure outcome? More importantly, what prevents this monopoly rent extraction from escalating? The absence of credible commitment mechanisms or governance constraints suggests sequencers face no competitive pressure - but then why haven't fees increased further? This puzzle deserves exploration.\n\nThe cross-rollup bridge pricing (0.1-0.5% fees) is presented as fact without economic derivation. This is a classic market-making problem: liquidity providers face capital costs, reorg risk, and opportunity costs. A simple model would treat the bridge fee as an option premium where LPs sell timing options to users. The equilibrium fee should relate to interest rates (capital costs), rollup finality times (option duration), and reorg probabilities (strike risk). Comparing this theoretical prediction to observed fees would validate whether the market is efficient or if there's excess rent extraction.\n\nThe blob fee market analysis is stronger, correctly identifying EIP-1559 exponential pricing dynamics. However, it could be enhanced with demand elasticity analysis: how much would L2 usage decline if blob fees increased 10\u00d7? This behavioral response is critical for predicting whether congestion would be self-limiting or spiral into sustained high fees.\n\nFinally, the state growth section identifies the problem but doesn't analyze the economic barriers to solutions. State rent is economically sound (users should pay for ongoing storage costs) but faces massive coordination costs and user opposition. Why? Because it breaks backward compatibility and imposes cognitive overhead. This is a political economy problem, not a technical one - the analysis should frame it as such and discuss potential Pareto-improving alternatives (e.g., state expiry with automatic renewal for active accounts).\n\nOverall, this revision shows strong progress in economic thinking, but needs to complete the sustainability analysis and deepen the mechanism design perspective on sequencer incentives and cross-rollup coordination.",
