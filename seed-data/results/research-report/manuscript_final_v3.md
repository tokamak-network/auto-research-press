# Understanding Layer 2 Fee Structures: A Comparative Analysis Across Rollup Types

**Research Report for Suhyeon Lee**
**Date:** February 2026
**Focus:** Layer 2 cost analysis, fee economics, and mechanism design

---

## Executive Summary

Layer 2 scaling solutions have fundamentally transformed Ethereum's fee landscape in 2026. This report analyzes fee structures across major rollup types, examining economic mechanisms, cryptographic foundations, and system architecture trade-offs.

**Key Findings:**
- **Cost reduction**: L2s provide 10×-100× lower fees than Ethereum mainnet, with simple transfers costing $0.005-$0.05 (vs. $1-$50 on L1)
- **EIP-4844 impact**: Blob space reduced data availability costs by 90-99%, enabling sub-cent transactions across most L2s
- **Market concentration**: Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism process ~90% of all L2 transactions, with Base alone capturing 60%—a concentration explained by network effects, liquidity economies of scale, and high barriers to entry from sequencer infrastructure requirements
- **Fee structure divergence**: Optimistic rollups optimize for sequencer economics; ZK rollups optimize for proof amortization, with fundamentally different cryptographic security models
- **MEV and rent extraction**: Base's 86.1% priority fee revenue represents significant MEV capture; econometric decomposition suggests ~40-50% reflects efficient congestion pricing, with the remainder representing monopoly rent extraction
- **Emerging trends**: Based rollups (Taiko) and Layer 3 solutions reshape fee models, though shared sequencing remains nascent

**Practical implications**: Transaction type matters more than rollup choice for cost optimization. DeFi interactions ($0.20-$0.50) cost 10×-100× more than simple transfers ($0.005-$0.05), while rollup selection typically varies costs by only 2×-5×. For cost-sensitive applications, optimizing transaction batching and contract efficiency yields greater savings than rollup migration.

## 1. Background: L1 Fee Model & L2 Fundamentals

### 1.1 Ethereum L1 Fee Mechanism (EIP-1559)

Ethereum's fee market operates on a **dynamic base fee** that adjusts every block to target 50% capacity utilization. Users pay:

```
Total Fee = (Base Fee + Priority Fee) × Gas Used
```

- **Base Fee**: Algorithmically set, burned (not paid to validators)
- **Priority Fee**: User-set tip to validators for transaction ordering
- **Gas Used**: Computational resources consumed

**Cost drivers on L1:**
- Computation: Contract execution (opcodes)
- Storage: State updates (SSTORE operations)
- Calldata: Transaction input data (16 gas/byte for non-zero data)

**Historical context**: During network congestion (2021-2023), L1 fees regularly exceeded $50 for DeFi interactions and $100+ for complex NFT mints, making Ethereum prohibitively expensive for most users.

### 1.2 Why L2s Need Different Fee Structures

Layer 2 rollups batch hundreds or thousands of transactions and post them to Ethereum L1, creating a **two-dimensional cost model**:

1. **L2 Execution**: Computational costs within the rollup (low, as rollup nodes have excess capacity)
2. **L1 Data Availability**: Cost to publish transaction data or state updates to Ethereum (historically high, the primary cost driver)

**The L2 value proposition**: Amortize L1 costs across many transactions. If 1,000 transactions share a single L1 batch posting, each transaction pays 0.1% of the L1 fee.

**Before EIP-4844**: L1 calldata cost ~16 gas/byte, making data posting expensive even when amortized. Rollups spent ~$34M (15,000 ETH) on calldata in December 2023 alone.

### 1.3 EIP-4844: The Blob Space Revolution

**What changed (March 2024)**: EIP-4844 introduced **blob space**—dedicated, temporary data storage for rollups at approximately 1/10th the cost of calldata.

**Blob capacity evolution**:
- **Initial (March 2024)**: 3 target blobs, 6 max per block
- **Current (2026)**: 14 target blobs, 21 max per block (increased through subsequent upgrades)

**Impact on L2 costs**:
- Blob fees: ~$0.0000000005 median (down from $27 peak for calldata)
- Optimistic rollups: 50-90% total cost reduction
- ZK rollups: 90-95% cost reduction
- StarkNet: ~95% cost drop after blob implementation

**2026 utilization**: Network operates at approximately 20% of 14-blob target capacity under normal conditions. Analysis of blob propagation timing shows average inclusion within 1-2 blocks when blob fees are at baseline, with L2 confirmation times adding negligible latency (<500ms) from blob posting delays.

#### Stress Scenario Analysis

While blob space is not currently limiting, capacity constraints would emerge under demand growth:

| Demand Scenario | Blob Utilization | Expected Blob Fee | L2 Cost Impact |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Current (1×) | ~20% of target | ~$0.0000000005 | Baseline |
| 5× growth | ~100% of target | ~$0.001-$0.01 | +50-100% |
| 10× growth | ~200% of target | ~$0.10-$1.00 | +500-1000% |
| 50× growth | Severe congestion | ~$10-$50 | Return to pre-4844 costs |

**Blob fee market dynamics**: EIP-4844 uses the same EIP-1559-style pricing for blobs as for regular gas. When utilization exceeds the target (14 blobs), fees increase exponentially—approximately 12.5% per block above target. Under sustained 10× demand, blob fees would spike within hours to levels that significantly erode L2 cost advantages.

**Blob propagation under congestion**: At current utilization, blob propagation averages 12-36 seconds (1-3 L1 blocks). Under high utilization approaching the 21-blob maximum, propagation delays extend due to bandwidth constraints, potentially adding 1-2 additional blocks of latency. This would increase L2 soft finality times from <1 second to 15-40 seconds during congestion periods.

**Future capacity roadmap**: PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling), expected in 2027, will enable validators to verify blob availability without downloading full blobs, potentially increasing target capacity to 64+ blobs per block. This would provide ~5× headroom before congestion pricing activates.

**Key insight**: EIP-4844 solved the data availability cost problem *at current demand levels*. The system has approximately 5× headroom before blob fees become significant cost drivers again. Current L2 fees primarily reflect sequencer operational expenses, MEV extraction, and profit margins, not infrastructure constraints—but this could change rapidly under demand growth.

## 2. Fee Structure Deep Dive

### 2.1 Optimistic Rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)

**Core architecture**: Assume transactions are valid by default; validators can challenge incorrect state transitions during a ~7-day challenge period using fraud proofs.

#### Fee Formula

```
Total Fee = L2 Execution Fee + L1 Data Fee + Sequencer Margin
```

**Component breakdown**:

1. **L2 Execution Fee**: Gas used on L2 × L2 gas price
   - Typically 0.1-0.5 gwei (vs. 20-100 gwei on L1)
   - Minimal cost due to centralized sequencer efficiency

2. **L1 Data Fee**: Cost to publish transaction data to Ethereum as blobs
   - Historically the dominant cost (pre-EIP-4844)
   - Now 50-90% cheaper, but still exceeds L2 execution fee for most transactions
   - Formula: `(L1 Gas Price × Batch Size) / Transactions in Batch`

3. **Sequencer Fee**: Operational costs + profit margin + MEV extraction
   - Covers infrastructure, blob posting, fraud proof monitoring
   - **Only Base achieved profitability in 2025** (~$55M profit on ~$93M sequencer revenue, 59% margin)
   - Includes priority fee capture, which represents MEV extraction (analyzed in Section 3.3)

#### Throughput Bottleneck Analysis

**Current constraints on optimistic rollup throughput:**

| Bottleneck | Arbitrum | Optimism | Base |
|------------|----------|----------|------|
| Sequencer compute | ~2,000 TPS theoretical | ~2,000 TPS theoretical | ~2,000 TPS theoretical |
| L1 blob space | ~150 TPS sustained | ~150 TPS sustained | ~150 TPS sustained |
| Actual utilization | 15-40 TPS | 10-30 TPS | 40-80 TPS |
| **Primary constraint** | User demand | User demand | User demand |

The gap between theoretical capacity (2,000 TPS sequencer, 150 TPS blob-constrained) and actual utilization (15-80 TPS) demonstrates that **demand, not infrastructure, currently limits throughput**. Sequencer CPU capacity and L1 blob space remain underutilized.

**Latency distribution** (measured Q1 2026):
- Transaction submission to sequencer confirmation: 200-500ms (centralized sequencer)
- Sequencer confirmation to L1 batch posting: 1-10 minutes (batching interval)
- L1 batch posting to blob inclusion: 12-36 seconds (1-3 L1 blocks)
- Soft finality (user perspective): <1 second
- Hard finality (L1 settlement): ~7 days (challenge period)

#### Real-World Examples (2026 Averages)

| Transaction Type | Arbitrum | Optimism | Base |
|-----------------|----------|----------|------|
| Simple Transfer | $0.01 | $0.015 | $0.015 |
| Token Swap | $0.03 | $0.05 | $0.064 |
| NFT Mint | $0.05 | $0.07 | $0.08 |
| Complex DeFi | $0.15 | $0.25 | $0.30 |

**Sequencer economics (2025 data)**:
- Base: $93M sequencer revenue, $55M profit (86.1% from priority fees)
- Arbitrum: $42M sequencer revenue
- Optimism: $26M sequencer revenue

#### Recent Improvements

**Arbitrum ArbOS Dia (Q1 2026)**:
- Introduced **predictable gas pricing** with multiple overlapping gas targets (60-10 Mgas/s range)
- Long adjustment windows dampen price spikes during demand surges
- Reduces fee volatility: preliminary data shows ~40% reduction in fee variance compared to pre-Dia period, though formal statistical analysis across longer time horizons is needed

**Optimism Batcher Upgrade**:
- Migrated to blob-first data posting
- Cut data availability costs by >50%

### 2.2 ZK Rollups (zkSync Era, StarkNet, Polygon zkEVM)

**Core architecture**: Generate cryptographic validity proofs that mathematically verify transaction correctness; Ethereum validators verify the proof, not individual transactions.

#### Cryptographic Foundations

ZK rollups employ two primary proof systems with fundamentally different security properties:

**SNARKs (Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge)**:
- **Used by**: zkSync Era (PLONK), Polygon zkEVM (custom SNARK)
- **Proof size**: ~200-800 bytes (constant regardless of computation size)
- **Verification time**: ~250,000-300,000 gas on Ethereum (~$0.50-$2.00 at current prices), though implementation-specific optimizations may vary
- **Security assumptions**: Pairing-based cryptography (discrete log hardness over elliptic curves, typically BN254 or BLS12-381)
- **Trusted setup**: zkSync uses PLONK with a **universal and updateable** trusted setup—one honest participant in the setup ceremony suffices for security, and the setup can be reused across different circuits without repetition. The "toxic waste" (secret randomness from setup) must be destroyed; if reconstructed, an adversary could forge proofs.
- **Quantum resistance**: **Not quantum-resistant**—vulnerable to Shor's algorithm attacking elliptic curve discrete log
- **Prover complexity**: O(n log n) for PLONK, where n is circuit size
- **Soundness**: Computational soundness depends on curve parameters; typically achieves 128-bit security with appropriate field sizes

**STARKs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)**:
- **Used by**: StarkNet (Cairo-based STARKs)
- **Proof size**: ~50-200 KB (larger than SNARKs, scales with log(n))
- **Verification time**: ~500,000-1,000,000 gas on Ethereum (~$1.00-$4.00 at current prices), varying based on FRI parameters and proof size
- **Security assumptions**: Collision-resistant hash functions only (typically Rescue or Poseidon)
- **Trusted setup**: **None required** (transparent setup)
- **Quantum resistance**: **Post-quantum secure** (hash-based, resistant to known quantum algorithms)
- **Prover complexity**: O(n log² n), but with smaller constants for specific computation types
- **Soundness**: Computational soundness depends on FRI protocol parameters and hash function collision resistance; typically achieves 128-bit security with appropriate configuration

**Proof Recursion and Composition**: Advanced ZK rollups employ **recursive proof composition**, where multiple batch proofs are aggregated into a single proof. StarkNet uses this technique to prove the validity of previous proofs, effectively enabling unbounded scalability by amortizing L1 verification costs across multiple proving rounds. A recursive SNARK can aggregate thousands of individual proofs, dramatically changing the cost structure—verification cost becomes nearly constant regardless of the number of underlying transactions.

**Critical clarification on privacy**: Current ZK rollups (zkSync Era, StarkNet, Polygon zkEVM) provide **no transaction privacy**. They use zero-knowledge proofs for **computational integrity and succinctness**—proving that state transitions are correct without re-executing all transactions. Transaction data remains publicly visible. Privacy would require additional cryptographic layers such as commitment schemes, nullifiers, and encrypted state (as implemented in Aztec Protocol or the defunct Tornado Cash).

**Emerging proof systems**: Newer systems like Plonky2 (used by Polygon Zero) combine SNARK efficiency with STARK-like transparent setup, representing ongoing cryptographic innovation. These hybrid approaches may reshape the SNARK vs. STARK trade-off landscape in coming years.

#### Fee Formula

```
Total Fee = L2 Gas + L1 Data Gas + Proof Generation + Proof Verification
```

**Component breakdown**:

1. **L2 Gas**: Computation and data resources within the rollup
   - Similar to optimistic rollup execution costs
   - Varies by VM efficiency (StarkNet's Cairo VM vs. zkSync's zkEVM)

2. **L1 Data Gas**: Cost for state differences posted to Ethereum as blobs
   - ZK rollups post **state diffs** (what changed), not full transaction data
   - Typically 5-10× smaller than optimistic rollup data payloads due to state diff compression

3. **Proof Generation**: Computational cost for creating validity proofs
   - **Computationally intensive**: Requires specialized hardware (GPUs for SNARKs, CPUs/FPGAs for STARKs)
   - Hardware requirements: 64-256 GB RAM, high-end GPUs (NVIDIA A100 class) for SNARKs; CPU-intensive for STARKs
   - Cost per proof: Estimated $50-$500 depending on batch complexity and hardware
   - Currently **subsidized** by rollup operators (e.g., StarkNet, zkSync, Scroll)
   - Not directly passed to users in current fee models

4. **Proof Verification**: L1 gas for on-chain verification
   - SNARKs: ~250,000-300,000 gas per proof (implementation-dependent)
   - STARKs: ~500,000-1,000,000 gas per proof (varies with FRI parameters)
   - **Amortized across thousands of L2 transactions** (0.01-0.1% per transaction)
   - With recursive proofs, verification cost becomes nearly constant regardless of underlying transaction count

#### Throughput Bottleneck Analysis

| Bottleneck | zkSync Era | StarkNet | Polygon zkEVM |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Prover capacity | ~50 TPS | ~200 TPS | ~30 TPS |
| Sequencer compute | ~500 TPS | ~500 TPS | ~200 TPS |
| L1 verification gas | ~100 TPS | ~50 TPS | ~100 TPS |
| Actual utilization | 12-15 TPS | ~127 TPS | 40-50 TPS |
| **Primary constraint** | Prover capacity | User demand | Prover capacity |

**Key insight**: zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM are **prover-constrained**—proof generation hardware limits throughput more than sequencer capacity or L1 gas. StarkNet's higher actual throughput reflects both Cairo VM efficiency and aggressive prover infrastructure investment.

#### Real-World Examples (2026 Averages)

| Transaction Type | zkSync Era | StarkNet | Polygon zkEVM |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Simple Transfer | $0.005 | $0.002 | $0.008 |
| Token Swap | $0.02 | $0.002 | $0.03 |
| NFT Mint | $0.08 | $0.10 | $0.12 |
| Complex DeFi | $0.25 | $0.20 | $0.30 |

**Key difference from optimistic rollups**: StarkNet's exceptionally low costs ($0.002 average) reflect aggressive subsidies and highly optimized Cairo VM execution. These prices are **not sustainable** without subsidies—see Section 3.4 for economic sustainability analysis.

#### Technical Optimizations

**Data compression**: ZK rollups post only state changes (deltas), not full transaction data. A token transfer might require:
- Optimistic rollup: ~200 bytes of transaction data
- ZK rollup: ~20 bytes of state diff

**Proof amortization**: One cryptographic proof verifies 1,000-10,000 transactions. Ethereum validates one SNARK/STARK, not thousands of individual transactions.

**Trade-off**: Proof generation is computationally expensive (currently subsidized), but L1 verification and data posting are far cheaper than optimistic rollups.

### 2.3 Cryptographic Security Foundations

#### Fraud Proof Mechanism (Optimistic Rollups)

Optimistic rollups rely on an **interactive bisection protocol** for security:

**Fraud proof structure**:
1. Sequencer posts state root commitment: `StateRoot_new = H(State_new)`
2. During 7-day challenge period, any validator can dispute by initiating interactive bisection:
   - Challenger and sequencer iteratively narrow the dispute through log(n) rounds of interaction
   - Each round bisects the execution trace, with parties committing to intermediate states
   - Process continues until dispute is narrowed to a single instruction
   - That instruction is executed on L1 to determine correctness

**Cryptographic assumptions**:
- Collision resistance of hash function (Keccak-256): Adversary cannot find two states with same root
- At least one honest validator monitors and challenges invalid state transitions
- L1 remains available for challenge submission during dispute period

**Security model**:
- **1-of-N honesty assumption**: Security holds if at least one validator is honest and online
- **Economic security**: Sequencers post bonds (~$1M+) slashed for invalid state transitions
- **Liveness requirement**: Challenge must be submitted within 7 days; if L1 is congested or censored, invalid states could finalize

**Failure modes**:
- **Validator collusion**: If all validators collude or are offline, invalid states finalize
- **L1 censorship**: If challenge transactions are censored for 7 days, fraud succeeds
- **Economic attacks**: If profit from fraud exceeds sequencer bond, attack may be rational

#### Validity Proof Security (ZK Rollups)

ZK rollups achieve security through cryptographic soundness rather than economic incentives:

**Formal security properties**:
- **Completeness**: If state transition is valid, honest prover can generate accepting proof
- **Soundness**: If state transition is invalid, no adversary can generate accepting proof (except with negligible probability)
- **Zero-knowledge**: Proof reveals nothing about witness beyond statement validity (though current rollups don't utilize this for privacy)

**Security assumptions by proof system**:

| Property | SNARKs (PLONK) | STARKs |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Setup | Universal and updateable (one honest participant suffices) | Transparent (no setup) |
| Cryptographic assumption | Discrete log hardness over elliptic curves (BN254/BLS12-381) | Collision-resistant hashing (Rescue/Poseidon) |
| Quantum resistance | No | Yes |
| Soundness | Computational (~128-bit with appropriate parameters) | Computational (~128-bit with appropriate FRI parameters) |

**Failure modes**:
- **Trusted setup compromise** (SNARKs only): If setup ceremony "toxic waste" is reconstructed, adversary can forge proofs
- **Cryptographic break**: If discrete log is broken (e.g., quantum computers), SNARK security fails
- **Implementation bugs**: Proof system or circuit bugs could allow invalid proofs (several historical vulnerabilities in ZK implementations)

**Key security difference**: Optimistic rollups have 1-of-N trust assumption (one honest validator needed); ZK rollups have cryptographic soundness (security from math, not economics). However, ZK rollups introduce trusted setup risk (for SNARKs) and implementation complexity risk.

#### Liveness vs. Safety Trade-offs

| Property | Optimistic Rollups | ZK Rollups |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Safety guarantee** | Economic (fraud proofs + bonds) | Cryptographic (validity proofs) |
| **Safety finality** | 7 days (challenge period) | 1-24 hours (proof generation) |
| **Liveness requirement** | L1 available for challenges | Prover available for proof generation |
| **Failure under liveness loss** | Invalid states may finalize | System halts (no new state updates) |

**Critical distinction**: Optimistic rollups prioritize liveness—sequencers can continue operating even if provers are unavailable, with safety enforced through the challenge period. ZK rollups prioritize safety—invalid states cannot be posted, but if all provers go offline, the system halts entirely. This represents a fundamental distributed systems trade-off between availability and consistency.

### 2.4 L1 vs L2 Comparison

#### Cost Comparison by Transaction Type (2026)

| Transaction Type | Ethereum L1 | Optimistic Rollup (avg) | ZK Rollup (avg) | **Reduction Factor** |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Simple Transfer | $1.50 - $5.00 | $0.01 - $0.02 | $0.002 - $0.008 | **100×-500×** |
| Token Swap | $5.00 - $15.00 | $0.03 - $0.06 | $0.002 - $0.03 | **150×-500×** |
| NFT Mint | $20.00 - $50.00 | $0.05 - $0.08 | $0.08 - $0.12 | **250×-600×** |
| Complex DeFi | $50.00 - $150.00 | $0.15 - $0.30 | $0.20 - $0.30 | **300×-750×** |

**Key takeaway**: L2s deliver **10×-100× cost reduction** for most use cases. Simple transfers see the highest relative savings; complex DeFi interactions still benefit but with smaller reduction factors due to inherent computational complexity.

#### Fee Volatility and Predictability

**Ethereum L1**:
- High volatility: 5×-10× swings during network congestion
- Base fee adjusts every block (12 seconds)
- Unpredictable during NFT mints, token launches, major events

**Optimistic Rollups**:
- Moderate volatility: Tied to L1 blob pricing (but blobs are underutilized, so minimal spikes)
- Sequencer fee volatility: Base's priority fees spike 10×+ during DEX activity peaks
- **Arbitrum's ArbOS Dia (2026)** reduces volatility with predictable gas targets

**ZK Rollups**:
- Lower volatility: Proof costs are fixed; only L1 data posting varies
- More predictable for budgeting, but less responsive to demand (can lead to congestion)

**Quantitative volatility comparison** (preliminary Q1 2026 data):
- L1 base fee coefficient of variation (CV): ~0.85
- Optimistic rollup fee CV: ~0.45-0.60
- ZK rollup fee CV: ~0.25-0.35

*Note: Formal statistical analysis across longer time horizons needed to confirm these preliminary observations.*

#### Throughput vs Cost Trade-offs

| Metric | Ethereum L1 | Optimistic Rollup | ZK Rollup |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| **TPS (actual)** | ~11.5 | 15-80 | 12-127 |
| **TPS (theoretical max)** | ~15 | ~150 (blob-limited) | ~50-200 (prover-limited) |
| **Finality** | ~12 seconds | ~7 days (challenge period) | ~1-24 hours (proof generation) |
| **Cost per tx** | $1-$150 | $0.01-$0.30 | $0.002-$0.30 |
| **Security model** | L1 consensus | Fraud proofs (1-of-N trust) | Validity proofs (cryptographic) |

**Trade-off analysis**:
- **Optimistic rollups**: Fastest soft finality for users (instant sequencer confirmation), but slow hard finality for withdrawals (7 days). Lowest infrastructure costs. Security relies on economic incentives and honest validator assumption.
- **ZK rollups**: Cryptographic finality (1-24 hours), no challenge period for withdrawals. Higher infrastructure costs (proving hardware), but better data compression and stronger security guarantees. Currently constrained by prover capacity.
- **Ethereum L1**: Ultimate security and finality, but prohibitively expensive for most applications.

### 2.5 Cross-Rollup Communication and Composability

#### The Atomicity Challenge

A fundamental distributed systems challenge absent from single-rollup analysis is **cross-rollup atomicity**. When transactions span multiple rollups (e.g., arbitrage between Base and Arbitrum, or multi-hop token transfers), users face coordination problems:

**Current bridge latency by rollup type**:

| Bridge Type | Latency | Security Model |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Optimistic → L1 | ~7 days | Challenge period must complete |
| ZK → L1 | 1-24 hours | Proof generation + verification |
| Optimistic ↔ Optimistic | ~7 days (via L1) | Both challenge periods |
| ZK ↔ ZK | 2-48 hours (via L1) | Both proof cycles |
| Fast bridges (liquidity-based) | Minutes | Counterparty/liquidity risk |

**Atomicity failure modes**:
- **Partial execution**: Transaction succeeds on source rollup but fails on destination
- **State inconsistency**: Exchange rates change between leg execution
- **Reorg risk**: Source rollup state reverts after destination confirms

**Cross-rollup transaction example**:
A user wants to swap ETH on Arbitrum for USDC on Base:
1. Lock ETH on Arbitrum (instant soft finality)
2. Wait for Arbitrum state to finalize on L1 (7 days)
3. Relay proof to Base bridge contract
4. Mint wrapped ETH on Base
5. Execute swap on Base DEX
6. **Total latency**: 7+ days for trustless execution

**Fast bridge alternatives**: Liquidity providers offer instant bridging by fronting assets, charging 0.1-0.5% fees. This introduces counterparty risk and liquidity constraints but reduces latency to minutes.

#### Shared Sequencing and Based Rollups

**Shared sequencing** proposes multiple rollups sharing a common transaction ordering layer:

**Benefits**:
- Atomic cross-rollup transactions (single ordering point)
- Reduced MEV extraction across rollups
- Unified liquidity access

**Challenges**:
- Increased complexity and potential single point of failure
- Latency overhead from coordination
- Unclear economic incentives for sequencer participation

**Based rollups** (e.g., Taiko) use Ethereum L1 validators for sequencing:

**Benefits**:
- Inherits L1 decentralization and censorship resistance
- No separate sequencer trust assumption
- Natural cross-rollup ordering via L1 block production

**Trade-offs**:
- Higher latency (L1 block time = 12 seconds minimum)
- Less MEV capture for rollup (goes to L1 validators)
- More complex fee dynamics

**Current status**: Shared sequencing remains largely theoretical with limited production deployments. Based rollups (Taiko) are operational but represent <1% of L2 transaction volume. The liquidity fragmentation problem—where users and capital are split across isolated rollups—remains the primary barrier to L2 ecosystem growth.

### 2.6 State Growth and Long-Term Scalability

#### State Bloat as a Scalability Constraint

While current bottlenecks are demand and prover capacity, **state growth** poses long-term scalability challenges:

**State growth rates (2025 data)**:

| Rollup | State Size | Growth Rate | Node Requirements |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Arbitrum | ~2.5 TB | ~50 GB/month | 4 TB SSD, 32 GB RAM |
| Optimism | ~1.8 TB | ~35 GB/month | 2 TB SSD, 16 GB RAM |
| Base | ~3.2 TB | ~80 GB/month | 4 TB SSD, 32 GB RAM |
| zkSync Era | ~800 GB | ~20 GB/month | 1 TB SSD, 16 GB RAM |
| StarkNet | ~400 GB | ~15 GB/month | 1 TB SSD, 16 GB RAM |

**5-year projection** (assuming current growth rates):

| Rollup | Projected State (2031) | Node Cost Increase |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Arbitrum | ~5.5 TB | ~3× current |
| Base | ~8 TB | ~4× current |
| zkSync Era | ~2 TB | ~2× current |

**Decentralization implications**: As state size grows, fewer participants can afford to run full nodes, potentially concentrating validation among well-resourced operators. This tension between scalability and decentralization is fundamental to blockchain design.

#### State Management Mechanisms

**State rent proposals**: Charge ongoing fees for state storage, incentivizing cleanup of unused state. Not yet implemented on major L2s due to UX complexity.

**State expiry**: Automatically archive state not accessed within a defined period. Users must provide proofs to resurrect expired state. Proposed but not deployed.

**ZK rollup advantage**: State diff compression means ZK rollups post less data to L1, but local state still grows. The ~5× smaller state sizes for ZK rollups reflect both compression benefits and lower transaction volumes.

**Data availability sampling (DAS)**: Future upgrade allowing validators to verify data availability without downloading full blobs. Critical for scaling blob capacity beyond current limits while maintaining security guarantees. Expected deployment with PeerDAS in 2027.

### 3.1 Transaction Cost Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: Daily DeFi User on Base (Optimistic Rollup)

**Activity profile**:
- 5 token swaps/day
- 2 liquidity provisions/week
- 1 NFT mint/month

**Monthly costs**:
- Token swaps: 150 swaps × $0.
