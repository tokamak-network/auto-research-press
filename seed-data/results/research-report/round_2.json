      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a mechanism design perspective, this revision makes significant strides. The game-theoretic framing of sequencer incentives is exactly the right approach, and the recognition that Base's 86.1% priority fee capture represents a mechanism design failure is important. However, the analysis stops short of rigorous quantification. \n\nThe welfare analysis correctly identifies the wealth transfer but needs to go further. Standard public economics would estimate deadweight loss using the Harberger triangle approach: DWL = 0.5 \u00d7 \u03b5 \u00d7 (P_monopoly - P_competitive)\u00b2 \u00d7 Q, where \u03b5 is demand elasticity. You have transaction volume data and fee variation - this is estimable. The current 'unknown but likely significant' is unsatisfying for a mechanism design analysis.\n\nThe ZK rollup subsidy analysis is valuable but treats proof costs as exogenous. In reality, these are strategic choices: rollups choose batch sizes, proof systems, and hardware investments to optimize cost structures. A more rigorous approach would model the rollup's optimization problem: choose batch size b to minimize (fixed_cost/b + variable_cost_per_tx), subject to latency constraints and user demand. This would reveal whether current low fees reflect genuine economies of scale or unsustainable subsidies.\n\nThe missing piece is competitive dynamics. You document market concentration (Base 60%, top 3 = 90%) but don't analyze whether this is stable equilibrium or transitional. Are network effects and liquidity creating winner-take-all dynamics? If so, what are the welfare implications? Standard industrial organization theory suggests concentrated markets with high margins (Base's 59% profit margin) should attract entry - why hasn't this happened? Is it technical barriers, liquidity moats, or something else?\n\nFinally, the priority fee interpretation needs empirical decomposition. You list three possible explanations but don't test between them. A simple regression of priority fees on block fullness, MEV proxies (DEX volume, price volatility), and time effects would separate congestion pricing (efficient) from MEV extraction (potentially inefficient). This is critical for policy recommendations around decentralized sequencing.\n\nOverall, this is now a solid economic analysis with good intuition, but it needs more rigorous empirical work to support its quantitative claims. The theoretical frameworks are sound - now apply them to the data more systematically.",

        "Trusted setup description needs refinement: PLONK uses a 'universal and updateable' trusted setup, not just 'universal.' The key property is that one honest participant in the setup ceremony suffices, and the setup can be reused across circuits. The term 'toxic waste' is colloquial but acceptable if explained that it refers to the secret randomness that must be destroyed",
        "Proof verification gas costs are approximations that may vary significantly by implementation. zkSync Era uses a custom SNARK verifier that may differ from the stated 250k-300k gas range.

        "The soundness security level claim of '2^128 security' for both SNARKs and STARKs is oversimplified. PLONK's soundness depends on the specific curve and field size used; STARKs' soundness depends on FRI parameters and hash function security. Both can achieve 128-bit security but require careful parameter selection",

        "Clarify PLONK's trusted setup properties: 'zkSync uses PLONK with a universal and updateable trusted setup, where one honest participant suffices for security, and the setup can be reused across different circuits without ceremony repetition.' Add footnote explaining that 'toxic waste' refers to secret randomness from setup that enables proof forgery if reconstructed",
        "Add brief discussion of proof recursion/composition: 'Advanced ZK rollups employ recursive proof composition, where multiple batch proofs are aggregated into a single proof. StarkNet uses this to reduce L1 verification costs by proving the validity of previous proofs, enabling effectively unbounded scalability.' This is cryptographically significant",
        "Refine the fraud proof description: 'Optimistic rollups use interactive bisection protocols: challenger and sequencer iteratively narrow the dispute to a single instruction through log(n) rounds of interaction, then execute that instruction on L1. This minimizes L1 computation while maintaining security.' This is more technically accurate",
        "Add nuance to soundness claims: 'Both proof systems can achieve 128-bit computational soundness with appropriate parameter selection. PLONK's soundness depends on the discrete logarithm assumption over the chosen elliptic curve (typically BN254 or BLS12-381). STARKs' soundness depends on FRI protocol parameters and the collision resistance of the hash function (typically Rescue or Poseidon).'",
        "Consider adding a brief note on proof system evolution: 'Newer proof systems like Plonky2 (used by Polygon Zero) combine SNARK efficiency with STARK-like transparent setup, representing ongoing cryptographic innovation in this space.' This acknowledges the rapidly evolving landscape"

      "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic perspective, this revision represents a substantial improvement. The addition of Section 2.3 on cryptographic security foundations is the manuscript's strongest contribution, providing clear and accurate distinctions between fraud proof and validity proof security models. The 1-of-N trust assumption for optimistic rollups versus cryptographic soundness for ZK rollups is correctly characterized, and the failure mode analysis demonstrates solid understanding of the security landscape.\n\nThe privacy clarification is particularly valuable and addresses a pervasive misconception in the space. Many readers conflate 'zero-knowledge' with 'privacy,' when current ZK rollups use ZK proofs purely for succinctness and computational integrity verification. The manuscript correctly notes that privacy would require additional cryptographic layers (commitments, nullifiers, encrypted state), and the reference to Aztec Protocol as an example of privacy-focused ZK architecture is appropriate.\n\nThe SNARK vs STARK comparison is generally accurate, though some technical details need refinement. The trusted setup discussion should clarify that PLONK's setup is 'universal and updateable,' which is a critical property distinguishing it from circuit-specific setups like Groth16. The quantum resistance distinction is correct and important: SNARKs rely on elliptic curve discrete logarithm assumptions vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, while STARKs rely only on hash function collision resistance, which is believed to be post-quantum secure.\n\nHowever, the manuscript would benefit from discussing proof composition and recursion, which is increasingly central to ZK rollup scalability. StarkNet's use of recursive STARKs to aggregate multiple batches into a single proof is a significant cryptographic innovation that affects the cost model. Similarly, the fraud proof mechanism description could be more precise about interactive bisection protocols, which are the actual mechanism used in production systems like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nThe proof verification gas cost estimates are reasonable approximations but should be presented with appropriate caveats about implementation-specific variation. zkSync Era's custom verifier, for instance, may have different gas costs than a standard PLONK verifier. StarkNet's verification costs vary significantly based on FRI parameters and proof size, which depend on batch complexity.\n\nOverall, the cryptographic content is now substantially more rigorous and accurate than the first version. The manuscript demonstrates solid understanding of the underlying cryptographic primitives and security models. With minor refinements to technical precision around trusted setups, proof composition, and parameter-dependent security levels, this would be publication-ready from a cryptographic perspective. The economic analysis sections (3.3, 3.4) appropriately acknowledge the cryptographic cost drivers without overstepping into claims about cryptographic security properties, which is the right approach for an economics-focused paper.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems perspective, this revision demonstrates significantly improved technical depth. The bottleneck analysis correctly identifies that current L2 systems are demand-limited rather than infrastructure-limited - a crucial insight that many analyses miss. Your identification of prover capacity as the primary constraint for zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM is particularly valuable, as it highlights the asymmetry between sequencer throughput and proof generation capacity.\n\nHowever, the analysis still treats rollups as isolated systems and misses critical distributed systems challenges. The most glaring omission is cross-rollup atomicity and composability. When a transaction spans multiple rollups (e.g., arbitrage across Base and Arbitrum), you face distributed transaction challenges: how do you ensure atomicity without a global coordinator? What are the latency implications of multi-hop bridges? The current liquidity fragmentation you mention is fundamentally a distributed systems problem, not just a market structure issue.\n\nYour security analysis in Section 2.3 is strong but could go deeper on liveness vs. safety trade-offs. Optimistic rollups prioritize liveness (instant soft finality) at the cost of delayed safety (7-day challenge period). ZK rollups achieve faster safety (cryptographic finality in hours) but are vulnerable to prover liveness failures. What happens if all provers go offline? The system halts, unlike optimistic rollups where sequencers can continue operating. This fundamental trade-off deserves explicit treatment.\n\nThe blob capacity analysis needs stress testing. You claim blob space isn't limiting, but this is only true at current utilization (~20% of target capacity). Under 10x demand growth, blob fees would spike dramatically due to EIP-1559-style pricing. The manuscript should model blob fee market dynamics under congestion and analyze how this affects L2 confirmation times. Additionally, blob propagation times (12-36 seconds) become critical under high blob utilization - have you measured propagation delays when approaching the 21-blob maximum?\n\nYour game-theoretic sequencer analysis is sophisticated, but the welfare calculations are too simplified. You estimate $40-60M wealth transfer from monopoly sequencing, but don't account for dynamic inefficiencies: users may batch transactions suboptimally, avoid certain transaction types, or exit to other rollups. The deadweight loss from monopoly pricing likely exceeds static transfer calculations. Consider modeling user behavior changes under different fee regimes.\n\nThe ZK sustainability analysis makes progress but oversimplifies prover economics. Modern ZK systems use proof recursion (proving that you correctly verified a proof), which dramatically changes cost structures. A recursive SNARK can aggregate thousands of proofs into one, amortizing verification costs across multiple batches. Your cost model doesn't capture this. Additionally, specialized hardware (ASICs for specific proof systems) could reduce costs by 10-100x over general-purpose GPUs, similar to Bitcoin mining evolution. The manuscript should discuss hardware specialization trajectories and their impact on decentralization (will only large operators afford specialized provers?).\n\nFinally, the manuscript lacks discussion of data availability sampling and its security implications. As rollups scale, full nodes may not store all historical data. How does this affect security? What are the liveness implications if data becomes unavailable? These are fundamental distributed systems questions that affect long-term scalability.\n\nOverall, this is a solid technical analysis that has improved substantially from Round 1. With deeper treatment of cross-rollup communication, state growth constraints, and stress scenario modeling, this could become a strong reference document for understanding L2 scalability limits from a systems perspective.",
