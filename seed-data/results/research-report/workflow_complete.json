While the fee data is valuable, the analysis lacks the depth needed to understand the fundamental system design trade-offs. Several critical issues: (1) **Throughput analysis is superficial** - claiming 'zkSync Era: 12-15 TPS' without explaining whether this is limited by proof generation, sequencer capacity, or L1 gas constraints is insufficient. What's the theoretical maximum? Where's the bottleneck? (2) **Fault tolerance is underexamined** - optimistic rollups rely on fraud proofs, but there's no analysis of liveness under validator failures or the economic security of challenge mechanisms. What happens if no one monitors for fraud? (3) **Sequencer centralization is glossed over** - all major L2s use centralized sequencers, creating single points of failure and censorship. The manuscript mentions this but doesn't analyze the implications for system availability, MEV extraction, or censorship resistance. (4) **Network design is absent** - how do transactions propagate to sequencers? What's the latency distribution? How does blob propagation on L1 affect L2 confirmation times? (5) **Proof generation costs need rigorous analysis** - dismissing ZK rollup costs as 'subsidized' without analyzing computational complexity, hardware requirements, or realistic projections undermines the cost comparison. A 2-5x increase is mentioned but not justified. For a PhD-level research report, I'd expect: formal performance models, queuing theory analysis of batching efficiency, game-theoretic analysis of fee markets, empirical measurements of system bottlenecks, and adversarial analysis of security assumptions. The current version is a solid industry report but needs significant technical depth for academic rigor.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic perspective, this manuscript treats Layer 2 systems primarily as economic constructs while neglecting their fundamental nature as cryptographic protocols. The most significant issue is the superficial treatment of zero-knowledge proofs. The manuscript states ZK rollups 'generate cryptographic proofs (SNARKs or STARKs) that mathematically verify transaction correctness' without explaining what this means formally. SNARKs and STARKs have fundamentally different security models: SNARKs typically rely on pairing-based cryptography with trusted setup ceremonies (except transparent SNARKs like Bulletproofs), while STARKs use collision-resistant hash functions and are post-quantum secure. These differences have profound implications for long-term security, not just 'proof generation costs.' The claim that 'StarkNet's Cairo VM' provides efficiency gains needs cryptographic justification\u2014Cairo is designed for efficient STARK proving through algebraic intermediate representation (AIR), which constrains the computation model in ways that affect both security and functionality. The manuscript also conflates zero-knowledge (hiding witness data) with succinctness (short proofs). Current ZK rollups like zkSync and StarkNet provide NO transaction privacy\u2014they use ZK-SNARKs/STARKs purely for computational integrity with succinct proofs. Privacy would require additional cryptographic layers like commitment schemes, nullifiers, and encrypted state (as in Aztec or Tornado Cash). The fraud proof discussion for optimistic rollups is similarly underdeveloped. The '7-day challenge period' is mentioned as an operational parameter without explaining the underlying cryptographic challenge-response protocol: how are fraud proofs constructed? What Merkle proofs are required? What are the game-theoretic and cryptographic assumptions ensuring honest validators will challenge? The manuscript would benefit from: (1) formal security definitions for rollup validity (what does it mean cryptographically for a state transition to be 'correct'?), (2) explicit statement of cryptographic assumptions (discrete log hardness, collision resistance, pairing security), (3) analysis of proof system trade-offs beyond cost (setup requirements, quantum resistance, proof size vs. verification time), and (4) discussion of potential cryptographic attacks (sequencer censorship, proof forgery, state commitment collisions). The economic analysis is strong, but without cryptographic rigor, the manuscript cannot adequately assess the security-cost trade-offs that are central to rollup design.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a blockchain economics perspective, this manuscript reads more as a technical survey than an economic analysis. The core weakness is treating fee structures as engineering parameters rather than mechanism design problems with strategic agents and welfare implications. \n\nThe sequencer economics section is particularly concerning. You note Base achieved profitability with 86.1% revenue from priority fees but don't analyze what this means economically. This is likely MEV extraction\u2014users paying for transaction ordering in a competitive environment. The economic questions are: (1) Is this efficient price discovery or monopoly rent extraction? (2) How does centralized sequencing affect welfare distribution? (3) What are the incentive compatibility properties of priority fee auctions? These require game-theoretic modeling, not just revenue reporting.\n\nThe subsidy discussion for ZK rollups lacks financial rigor. You claim costs could increase '2\u00d7-5\u00d7' post-subsidy but provide no model. What are the actual proving costs? What transaction volumes achieve economies of scale? What's the competitive equilibrium when multiple ZK rollups compete without subsidies? StarkNet's $0.002 fee is economically interesting precisely because it's unsustainable\u2014this deserves formal analysis of predatory pricing dynamics and market shakeout scenarios.\n\nThe fee volatility claims need statistical backing. You state L2 fees are '3\u00d7-5\u00d7 more predictable' than 2024 but show no variance calculations, confidence intervals, or time-series analysis. Arbitrum's ArbOS Dia is described qualitatively when it should be evaluated quantitatively: Does it reduce variance? At what cost to allocative efficiency? Does dampening price signals create deadweight loss?\n\nThe market concentration analysis (90% on three L2s) is purely descriptive. Economic theory predicts this through network effects and economies of scale in liquidity provision, but you don't model these forces. Why is this equilibrium stable? What are the barriers to entry? Is this a natural monopoly situation? The 21Shares forecast about L2 failures is cited without economic explanation of the selection mechanism.\n\nCritically missing is any discussion of economic security. Sequencer revenue must compensate for security provision (fraud proof monitoring, liveness guarantees, censorship resistance). You note only Base is profitable but don't analyze whether this revenue adequately covers security costs or if we're seeing under-provision of security goods. This is fundamental to L2 sustainability.\n\nFor Tokamak Network positioning, the recommendations are strategic but not economically grounded. 'Focus on fee predictability' needs cost-benefit analysis: What's the value of reduced variance to users? What's the efficiency cost of dampened price signals? 'Develop niche ecosystem' requires market segmentation analysis and competitive dynamics modeling.\n\nTo elevate this to publication quality in blockchain economics, you need: (1) Formal game-theoretic models of sequencer behavior, (2) Quantitative analysis of fee market efficiency and welfare, (3) Economic security calculations, (4) Statistical rigor for empirical claims, and (5) Mechanism design evaluation of alternative fee structures.

The game-theoretic framing of sequencer incentives is exactly the right approach, and the recognition that Base's 86.1% priority fee capture represents a mechanism design failure is important. However, the analysis stops short of rigorous quantification. \n\nThe welfare analysis correctly identifies the wealth transfer but needs to go further. Standard public economics would estimate deadweight loss using the Harberger triangle approach: DWL = 0.5 \u00d7 \u03b5 \u00d7 (P_monopoly - P_competitive)\u00b2 \u00d7 Q, where \u03b5 is demand elasticity. You have transaction volume data and fee variation - this is estimable. The current 'unknown but likely significant' is unsatisfying for a mechanism design analysis.\n\nThe ZK rollup subsidy analysis is valuable but treats proof costs as exogenous. In reality, these are strategic choices: rollups choose batch sizes, proof systems, and hardware investments to optimize cost structures. A more rigorous approach would model the rollup's optimization problem: choose batch size b to minimize (fixed_cost/b + variable_cost_per_tx), subject to latency constraints and user demand. This would reveal whether current low fees reflect genuine economies of scale or unsustainable subsidies.\n\nThe missing piece is competitive dynamics. You document market concentration (Base 60%, top 3 = 90%) but don't analyze whether this is stable equilibrium or transitional. Are network effects and liquidity creating winner-take-all dynamics? If so, what are the welfare implications? Standard industrial organization theory suggests concentrated markets with high margins (Base's 59% profit margin) should attract entry - why hasn't this happened? Is it technical barriers, liquidity moats, or something else?\n\nFinally, the priority fee interpretation needs empirical decomposition. You list three possible explanations but don't test between them. A simple regression of priority fees on block fullness, MEV proxies (DEX volume, price volatility), and time effects would separate congestion pricing (efficient) from MEV extraction (potentially inefficient). This is critical for policy recommendations around decentralized sequencing.\n\nOverall, this is now a solid economic analysis with good intuition, but it needs more rigorous empirical work to support its quantitative claims. The theoretical frameworks are sound - now apply them to the data more systematically.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic perspective, this revision represents a substantial improvement. The addition of Section 2.3 on cryptographic security foundations is the manuscript's strongest contribution, providing clear and accurate distinctions between fraud proof and validity proof security models. The 1-of-N trust assumption for optimistic rollups versus cryptographic soundness for ZK rollups is correctly characterized, and the failure mode analysis demonstrates solid understanding of the security landscape.\n\nThe privacy clarification is particularly valuable and addresses a pervasive misconception in the space. Many readers conflate 'zero-knowledge' with 'privacy,' when current ZK rollups use ZK proofs purely for succinctness and computational integrity verification. The manuscript correctly notes that privacy would require additional cryptographic layers (commitments, nullifiers, encrypted state), and the reference to Aztec Protocol as an example of privacy-focused ZK architecture is appropriate.\n\nThe SNARK vs STARK comparison is generally accurate, though some technical details need refinement. The trusted setup discussion should clarify that PLONK's setup is 'universal and updateable,' which is a critical property distinguishing it from circuit-specific setups like Groth16. The quantum resistance distinction is correct and important: SNARKs rely on elliptic curve discrete logarithm assumptions vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, while STARKs rely only on hash function collision resistance, which is believed to be post-quantum secure.\n\nHowever, the manuscript would benefit from discussing proof composition and recursion, which is increasingly central to ZK rollup scalability. StarkNet's use of recursive STARKs to aggregate multiple batches into a single proof is a significant cryptographic innovation that affects the cost model. Similarly, the fraud proof mechanism description could be more precise about interactive bisection protocols, which are the actual mechanism used in production systems like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nThe proof verification gas cost estimates are reasonable approximations but should be presented with appropriate caveats about implementation-specific variation. zkSync Era's custom verifier, for instance, may have different gas costs than a standard PLONK verifier. StarkNet's verification costs vary significantly based on FRI parameters and proof size, which depend on batch complexity.\n\nOverall, the cryptographic content is now substantially more rigorous and accurate than the first version. The manuscript demonstrates solid understanding of the underlying cryptographic primitives and security models. With minor refinements to technical precision around trusted setups, proof composition, and parameter-dependent security levels, this would be publication-ready from a cryptographic perspective. The economic analysis sections (3.3, 3.4) appropriately acknowledge the cryptographic cost drivers without overstepping into claims about cryptographic security properties, which is the right approach for an economics-focused paper.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a distributed systems perspective, this revision demonstrates significantly improved technical depth. The bottleneck analysis correctly identifies that current L2 systems are demand-limited rather than infrastructure-limited - a crucial insight that many analyses miss. Your identification of prover capacity as the primary constraint for zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM is particularly valuable, as it highlights the asymmetry between sequencer throughput and proof generation capacity.\n\nHowever, the analysis still treats rollups as isolated systems and misses critical distributed systems challenges. The most glaring omission is cross-rollup atomicity and composability. When a transaction spans multiple rollups (e.g., arbitrage across Base and Arbitrum), you face distributed transaction challenges: how do you ensure atomicity without a global coordinator? What are the latency implications of multi-hop bridges? The current liquidity fragmentation you mention is fundamentally a distributed systems problem, not just a market structure issue.\n\nYour security analysis in Section 2.3 is strong but could go deeper on liveness vs. safety trade-offs. Optimistic rollups prioritize liveness (instant soft finality) at the cost of delayed safety (7-day challenge period). ZK rollups achieve faster safety (cryptographic finality in hours) but are vulnerable to prover liveness failures. What happens if all provers go offline? The system halts, unlike optimistic rollups where sequencers can continue operating. This fundamental trade-off deserves explicit treatment.\n\nThe blob capacity analysis needs stress testing. You claim blob space isn't limiting, but this is only true at current utilization (~20% of target capacity). Under 10x demand growth, blob fees would spike dramatically due to EIP-1559-style pricing. The manuscript should model blob fee market dynamics under congestion and analyze how this affects L2 confirmation times. Additionally, blob propagation times (12-36 seconds) become critical under high blob utilization - have you measured propagation delays when approaching the 21-blob maximum?\n\nYour game-theoretic sequencer analysis is sophisticated, but the welfare calculations are too simplified. You estimate $40-60M wealth transfer from monopoly sequencing, but don't account for dynamic inefficiencies: users may batch transactions suboptimally, avoid certain transaction types, or exit to other rollups. The deadweight loss from monopoly pricing likely exceeds static transfer calculations. Consider modeling user behavior changes under different fee regimes.\n\nThe ZK sustainability analysis makes progress but oversimplifies prover economics. Modern ZK systems use proof recursion (proving that you correctly verified a proof), which dramatically changes cost structures. A recursive SNARK can aggregate thousands of proofs into one, amortizing verification costs across multiple batches. Your cost model doesn't capture this. Additionally, specialized hardware (ASICs for specific proof systems) could reduce costs by 10-100x over general-purpose GPUs, similar to Bitcoin mining evolution. The manuscript should discuss hardware specialization trajectories and their impact on decentralization (will only large operators afford specialized provers?).\n\nFinally, the manuscript lacks discussion of data availability sampling and its security implications. As rollups scale, full nodes may not store all historical data. How does this affect security? What are the liveness implications if data becomes unavailable? These are fundamental distributed systems questions that affect long-term scalability.\n\nOverall, this is a solid technical analysis that has improved substantially from Round 1. With deeper treatment of cross-rollup communication, state growth constraints, and stress scenario modeling, this could become a strong reference document for understanding L2 scalability limits from a systems perspective.",

          "detailed_feedback": "From a cryptographic perspective, this manuscript represents a significant improvement over previous versions. The treatment of proof systems is now technically accurate, with proper distinction between SNARKs and STARKs, correct identification of security assumptions, and appropriate caveats about trusted setups and quantum resistance. The security model analysis correctly distinguishes economic security (fraud proofs with 1-of-N honesty) from cryptographic security (validity proofs with computational soundness), which is fundamental to understanding rollup trust models.\n\nHowever, several areas could benefit from additional cryptographic rigor. First, the fraud proof mechanism would be strengthened by explicitly describing the Merkle commitment structure used in bisection protocols\u2014security relies on the binding property of these commitments, and adversaries cannot equivocate about intermediate execution states. Second, the trusted setup discussion, while improved, should clarify that PLONK's universal setup means the same setup can be reused across different circuits (unlike Groth16's circuit-specific setup), but the setup ceremony itself still requires careful MPC protocol execution. Third, the verification gas costs should be tied to specific implementations and parameter choices rather than broad ranges, as these vary significantly based on proof system configuration.\n\nThe manuscript would also benefit from discussing concrete cryptographic vulnerabilities that have affected production systems. The Polygon zkEVM soundness bug (where under-constrained circuits allowed invalid state transitions) and various PLONK implementation issues in zkSync demonstrate that proof system security depends not just on theoretical properties but on correct implementation. These examples would ground the failure mode analysis in reality.\n\nFinally, the treatment of proof recursion is good but could be expanded to discuss the specific recursive composition techniques used (e.g., cycle of curves for SNARK recursion, FRI-based recursion for STARKs) and their security implications. Recursive proof composition introduces additional assumptions\u2014the outer proof system must be able to efficiently verify the inner proof system, which constrains cryptographic choices.\n\nOverall, this is strong work that demonstrates solid understanding of rollup cryptography.

The bottleneck analysis correctly identifies that current L2s are demand-limited rather than infrastructure-limited, which is critical for understanding scalability headroom. The cryptographic security comparison between fraud proofs and validity proofs properly frames the fundamental trade-off between liveness-favoring (optimistic) and safety-favoring (ZK) designs - this is the classic availability vs. consistency tension from distributed systems theory.\n\nHowever, several areas need more rigorous treatment. The latency measurements lack statistical rigor - distributed systems require percentile analysis, not just ranges. The '200-500ms' sequencer confirmation time likely has a long tail under load that significantly impacts user experience. The blob propagation analysis (12-36 seconds) doesn't account for network topology effects or validator bandwidth heterogeneity, which are critical in gossip-based systems. You need p95/p99 latencies under different blob utilization levels.\n\nThe cross-rollup atomicity analysis is excellent and addresses a critical gap, but it needs deeper treatment of failure recovery. What happens when a cross-rollup transaction fails mid-execution? Are there timeout mechanisms? How do you handle partial state commitment? The 7-day bridge latency for optimistic rollups creates a massive coordination problem that deserves formal analysis of failure modes and recovery protocols.\n\nThe throughput bottleneck tables are valuable, but they need empirical validation. The claim that zkSync Era is 'prover-constrained' at 50 TPS needs supporting evidence - what happens at 40 TPS vs. 45 TPS vs. 50 TPS? Do you see proof generation latency increase? Queue buildup? You need degradation curves, not just point estimates. Similarly, the 'sequencer compute' limits of ~2,000 TPS need validation - is this CPU-bound, memory-bound, or I/O-bound? What's the actual resource utilization at current loads?\n\nThe state growth analysis is too simplistic. Linear extrapolation from current growth rates ignores transaction complexity evolution, contract deployment patterns, and state access locality. Real-world state growth is likely sub-linear due to economies of scale in contract reuse, but could be super-linear if transaction complexity increases. You need confidence bounds and sensitivity analysis.\n\nMissing entirely is analysis of sequencer failure modes. Base's centralized sequencer is a single point of failure - what's the failover mechanism? Transaction reorg risk? User impact during downtime? This is fundamental to understanding system reliability. The manuscript would benefit from a formal failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) covering Byzantine failures, crash failures, and network partitions.\n\nThe blob space stress scenario analysis is well-done, but needs more detail on the EIP-1559 dynamics for blobs. The exponential fee increase (12.5% per block above target) will create severe price volatility under sustained demand - this deserves quantitative modeling of fee trajectories under different demand scenarios.\n\nOverall, this is strong work that demonstrates good understanding of L2 architecture and distributed systems principles. With more rigorous empirical validation, formal latency analysis, and deeper treatment of failure modes, this would be publication-quality research.

          "detailed_feedback": "From a mechanism design and tokenomics perspective, this revision demonstrates significantly improved economic reasoning. The MEV decomposition into efficient congestion pricing versus rent extraction is exactly the type of analysis needed - though I'd push for more detail on the econometric methodology (what instruments were used? how was the counterfactual efficient price estimated?). The market concentration explanation now correctly identifies economic mechanisms rather than just observing outcomes, which is crucial for policy recommendations.\n\nHowever, several critical economic sustainability questions remain unaddressed. The most glaring is the incomplete Section 3.4 - without understanding the economics of prover subsidies and path to profitability, we cannot evaluate whether current ZK rollup fee structures represent sustainable equilibria or temporary promotional pricing. StarkNet's $0.002 average fees are presented as 'aggressive subsidies' but there's no analysis of the magnitude of subsidy (dollars per transaction? percentage of true cost?) or exit strategy.\n\nThe sequencer economics section improves with Base's profitability data, but lacks mechanism design depth. Why does Base capture 86.1% of revenue from priority fees while Arbitrum and Optimism don't? Is this a technological difference, a strategic choice, or a market structure outcome? More importantly, what prevents this monopoly rent extraction from escalating? The absence of credible commitment mechanisms or governance constraints suggests sequencers face no competitive pressure - but then why haven't fees increased further? This puzzle deserves exploration.\n\nThe cross-rollup bridge pricing (0.1-0.5% fees) is presented as fact without economic derivation. This is a classic market-making problem: liquidity providers face capital costs, reorg risk, and opportunity costs. A simple model would treat the bridge fee as an option premium where LPs sell timing options to users. The equilibrium fee should relate to interest rates (capital costs), rollup finality times (option duration), and reorg probabilities (strike risk). Comparing this theoretical prediction to observed fees would validate whether the market is efficient or if there's excess rent extraction.\n\nThe blob fee market analysis is stronger, correctly identifying EIP-1559 exponential pricing dynamics. However, it could be enhanced with demand elasticity analysis: how much would L2 usage decline if blob fees increased 10\u00d7? This behavioral response is critical for predicting whether congestion would be self-limiting or spiral into sustained high fees.\n\nFinally, the state growth section identifies the problem but doesn't analyze the economic barriers to solutions. State rent is economically sound (users should pay for ongoing storage costs) but faces massive coordination costs and user opposition. Why? Because it breaks backward compatibility and imposes cognitive overhead. This is a political economy problem, not a technical one - the analysis should frame it as such and discuss potential Pareto-improving alternatives (e.g., state expiry with automatic renewal for active accounts).\n\nOverall, this revision shows strong progress in economic thinking, but needs to complete the sustainability analysis and deepen the mechanism design perspective on sequencer incentives and cross-rollup coordination.",
