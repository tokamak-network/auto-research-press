      "summary": "The revision shows meaningful structural improvement over Round 1\u2014the paper now engages substantively with MEV extraction, AMM dynamics, DEX vs. CEX microstructure, and regulatory frameworks (MiCA, SEC enforcement), directly addressing several of my prior concerns. However, the most critical promise from the author response\u2014a focused critical methodological review of backtesting practices with a structured taxonomy and comparison table\u2014was not delivered; instead, the paper remains a multi-topic survey, and the citation base still relies heavily on tangential or non-peer-reviewed sources while failing to actually cite the foundational works the authors explicitly committed to adding (Daian et al. 2020, Capponi & Jia 2021, Cong et al. 2023, Makarov & Schoar 2020).",
      "strengths": [
        "Section 3 now provides substantive engagement with on-chain market microstructure: the discussion of MEV extraction (frontrunning, sandwich attacks, mempool visibility), concentrated liquidity in Uniswap v3, and the distinction between DEX and CEX microstructure represents a genuine and significant improvement over Round 1. The treatment of cascading liquidation dynamics on Aave/Compound is technically sound and relevant.",
        "The regulatory discussion (Section 5) has been meaningfully upgraded: MiCA is now mentioned with its 2024 application date, SEC enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase are referenced, and FATF Travel Rule requirements are noted. This addresses the most egregious gap from Round 1 where five consecutive '[citation needed]' markers appeared.",
        "The backtesting critique in Section 2.2 identifies real and important methodological problems\u2014look-ahead bias from full-dataset normalization, absence of walk-forward validation, unrealistic transaction cost assumptions, and regime non-stationarity. The connection drawn between MEV dynamics and backtesting validity (i.e., that backtests ignoring MEV extraction misrepresent live performance) is a genuinely useful insight."

      "weaknesses": [
        "The most fundamental promise in the author response\u2014to reconceptualize the manuscript as a 'critical methodological review of backtesting practices' with a 'structured taxonomy of backtesting failures' and a 'structured comparison table documenting reported metrics, datasets, time periods, validation protocols, and known limitations across major method classes'\u2014was not delivered. There is no taxonomy, no comparison table, and no systematic documentation of specific papers' methodological failures. Section 2.2 discusses backtesting pitfalls in general terms but does not cite specific examples of papers exhibiting each failure mode, which was the core promised contribution.",
        "The citation base remains critically deficient despite explicit commitments to fix it. The authors promised to cite Daian et al. (2020), Capponi & Jia (2021), Aoyagi (2020), Makarov & Schoar (2020), Cong et al. (2023), Victor & Weintraub (2021), Barbon & Ranaldo (2021), Bao et al. (2017), Jiang et al. (2017), and Deng et al. (2016)\u2014none of these appear in the reference list. Daian et al. is mentioned in-text in Section 3.1 but has no corresponding reference entry. The reference list still includes tangential sources: [4] (Green AI for smart cities), [5] (AI in auditing), [10] (2013 arXiv preprint on technical analysis in equity markets). References [12] and [14] appear to be the same paper cited twice with different URLs. The numbering skips [2], [8], [11], [13], [15], suggesting incomplete cleanup from Round 1.",
        "The paper still attempts to cover too many topics for a short paper\u2014prediction architectures, backtesting methodology, MEV extraction, AMM dynamics, DEX/CEX microstructure, fraud detection, wash trading, regulatory frameworks, ethics, environmental concerns, and future trajectories\u2014resulting in each topic receiving 1-3 paragraphs of treatment rather than the deep, evidence-based analysis promised. The wash trading discussion (Section 4) mentions ML approaches but cites no specific wash trading detection papers (Cong et al. 2023 and Victor & Weintraub 2021 were explicitly promised). The MEV discussion in Section 3.1 references Flashbots data but provides no citation for the 'billions of dollars' claim."
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Immediately fix the reference list: add formal citations for every work mentioned in-text (Daian et al. 2020 is discussed at length but missing from references), remove duplicate entries ([12] and [14]), restore sequential numbering, and replace tangential citations ([4], [5], [10]) with the domain-specific works promised in the author response. At minimum, the reference list must include Daian et al. (2020) 'Flash Boys 2.0,' Capponi & Jia (2021) on AMM design, Cong et al. (2023) on wash trading, and Makarov & Schoar (2020) on crypto arbitrage\u2014all of which were explicitly committed to.",
        "Deliver the promised structured comparison table of backtesting practices across published crypto-AI papers. Even a compact table covering 8-10 representative studies, documenting for each: (1) architecture type, (2) dataset and time period, (3) validation protocol used, (4) whether transaction costs were modeled, (5) whether walk-forward validation was employed, and (6) key reported metric\u2014would constitute the concrete analytical contribution the paper currently lacks. Without this, the backtesting critique remains a list of general concerns rather than an evidence-based review.",
        "Choose one of the two threads\u2014backtesting methodology critique OR AI's impact on on-chain microstructure\u2014and develop it as the primary contribution, with the other serving as supporting context. Currently both are treated at intermediate depth, and neither reaches the level of rigor needed for a genuine contribution. If the backtesting thread is chosen, the comparison table is essential. If the microstructure thread is chosen, provide quantitative evidence on MEV extraction volumes (with citations to Flashbots Explore data or academic analyses), empirical measurements of sandwich attack frequency and cost, and data on AI-driven arbitrage's effect on DEX-CEX price convergence."
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From the perspective of cryptocurrency market microstructure and digital asset economics, this revision represents a genuine but incomplete improvement. The most welcome change is the addition of Section 3, which now engages substantively with MEV extraction, AMM mechanics, and DEX vs. CEX dynamics\u2014topics that were entirely absent in Round 1. The discussion of sandwich attacks, mempool visibility, concentrated liquidity optimization, and cascading liquidation dynamics demonstrates that the authors have engaged with the conceptual substance of these topics. The regulatory section also shows improvement, with specific references to MiCA and SEC enforcement actions replacing the prior '[citation needed]' placeholders.\n\nHowever, the revision falls short of what was promised in the author response in several critical ways. First, the reconceptualization as a 'critical methodological review of backtesting practices' was not executed\u2014there is no structured taxonomy, no comparison table, and no systematic analysis of specific papers' methodological failures. The backtesting discussion in Section 2.2 reads as informed commentary rather than systematic review. Second, the citation problem, while improved in the body text, is actually worse in the reference list: Daian et al. (2020) is discussed extensively but never formally cited, the promised additions (Capponi & Jia, Cong et al., Makarov & Schoar, etc.) are absent, and tangential references remain. This is a serious scholarly deficiency\u2014the paper discusses MEV, AMM microstructure, and wash trading detection without citing the foundational empirical works in each area.\n\nSpecific technical concerns: The claim that 'Flashbots data indicate billions of dollars in cumulative extracted value on Ethereum' needs a citation (Flashbots Explore or academic analyses such as Weintraub et al. 2022). The discussion of AI-driven liquidity provision on Uniswap v3 would benefit from citing Fan et al. (2022) or Heimbach et al. (2022) on empirical LP behavior. The statement about AI-driven arbitrage improving cross-venue price convergence should reference Barbon & Ranaldo (2021) or Makarov & Schoar (2020). The wash trading discussion needs Cong et al. (2023) or Victor & Weintraub (2021). Without these citations, the microstructure claims, while directionally correct, lack the evidentiary grounding expected in a research contribution.\n\nThe paper also still suffers from scope diffusion. For a short paper, covering prediction architectures, backtesting methodology, MEV, AMMs, DEX/CEX dynamics, fraud detection, wash trading, regulation, ethics, environment, and future trajectories is simply too much. The result is that no single topic receives the depth needed to constitute a clear contribution. I would recommend the authors commit fully to either the backtesting critique (with the promised table and taxonomy) or the AI-microstructure analysis (with proper citations and quantitative evidence), and treat the other as brief supporting context.\n\nIn summary: the conceptual direction is improved and the authors clearly engaged with the feedback, but the execution\u2014particularly regarding citations and the promised analytical framework\u2014remains insufficient for publication.",

The narrower scope is appropriate for a short paper and the three-domain structure (prediction methodology, on-chain microstructure, fraud detection) is coherent.",
        "Section 3 on MEV extraction and AMM dynamics represents genuinely new content that engages with technically substantive material. The discussion of sandwich attacks, concentrated liquidity optimization as an RL problem, cascading liquidation dynamics, and the DEX vs. CEX microstructure distinction demonstrates improved domain understanding and adds analytical value.",
        "The reflexivity argument (Krafft et al.) is now better integrated throughout the paper, appearing in the backtesting critique (Section 2.2 on crowding effects eroding exploited patterns) and the conclusion, rather than as an isolated observation. This thread connecting prediction model deployment to market dynamics alteration is one of the paper's most intellectually interesting contributions."

This was identified as the 'core analytical contribution' in the author response and was the single most important action item from Round 1. Without it, the backtesting critique in Section 2.2 remains a qualitative enumeration of known pitfalls (data leakage, look-ahead bias, unrealistic cost assumptions, non-stationarity) that any ML practitioner would recognize, rather than an evidence-based systematic review documenting the prevalence and severity of these issues in specific published papers with specific examples.",

        "The backtesting critique lacks the specificity needed to constitute a genuine methodological contribution. Section 2.2 identifies categories of failure (data leakage, unrealistic assumptions, non-stationarity) but does not document a single specific instance of a published paper exhibiting these failures, does not quantify how prevalent each failure mode is across the literature, and does not provide the 'documented examples from published papers' that the authors promised. The critique reads as a textbook-level enumeration of known issues rather than a systematic empirical assessment of the field's practices."

        "The structured comparison table must be added\u2014this is non-negotiable for the paper's claimed contribution. Select 8-12 representative published studies spanning LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Transformer, and RL approaches to crypto prediction/trading. For each, document: (a) architecture, (b) dataset and time period, (c) prediction horizon, (d) validation protocol (simple split vs. walk-forward vs. expanding window), (e) whether transaction costs were modeled, (f) reported metrics and their values, (g) identified methodological weaknesses. This table would transform the paper from a qualitative opinion piece into an evidence-based critical review.",
        "Fix the reference list urgently. Add the foundational works you committed to citing: at minimum, Daian et al. (2020) needs a proper numbered entry, and Jiang et al. (2017) for RL portfolio management, Lim et al. (2021) for Temporal Fusion Transformers, and Makarov & Schoar (2020) for crypto arbitrage should appear as they directly support claims made in the text. Remove or replace tangential references ([4] smart cities, [5] auditing). Resolve the duplicate [12]/[14] issue. Ensure sequential numbering. Replace arXiv preprints with their published versions where available (Krafft et al. appeared in CHI 2018 proceedings).",
        "Ground the backtesting critique in specific examples. For instance, identify 2-3 published crypto-AI papers that use simple train-test splits without walk-forward validation and show how their reported accuracy would likely degrade under proper protocols. Cite specific studies where transaction costs were omitted and estimate the impact. Reference the well-documented phenomenon of crypto trading strategy decay (e.g., momentum strategies that worked pre-2020 failing post-2020) as evidence of regime change invalidating static backtests. Without such specificity, the critique does not advance beyond what is already well-known in the quantitative finance community."

      "detailed_feedback": "This revision represents a partial but incomplete response to Round 1 feedback. The structural reconceptualization is genuine and welcome\u2014the paper now has a coherent thesis centered on backtesting methodology critique and MEV/microstructure analysis, which is a significant improvement over the unfocused Round 1 survey. The MEV discussion in Section 3 is the strongest new material, demonstrating real engagement with how AI agents operate on-chain. However, the revision falls short of the authors' own stated commitments in several critical ways.\n\nFrom an AI/ML for financial market prediction standpoint, the backtesting critique in Section 2.2 remains at the level of a methods textbook rather than a research contribution. Every point made\u2014data leakage through full-dataset normalization, the need for walk-forward validation, the importance of transaction cost modeling, regime change as a confounder\u2014is well-established knowledge in quantitative finance and ML. The contribution would need to be either (a) a systematic empirical documentation of how prevalent these issues are in the crypto-AI literature specifically (which requires the promised comparison table), or (b) a novel framework or checklist that goes beyond existing guidance (e.g., Bailey et al.'s work on the probability of backtest overfitting, or L\u00f3pez de Prado's extensive work on backtesting pitfalls). Currently, it is neither.\n\nThe discussion of prediction architectures in Section 2.1 remains superficial from a technical standpoint. There is no discussion of how transformer attention mechanisms handle the specific statistical properties of crypto time series (heavy tails, volatility clustering, long-range dependence). The mention of LLMs for sentiment analysis is appropriate but lacks engagement with the actual literature\u2014FinBERT, CryptoBERT, and domain-adapted models are not cited, and no specific results from LLM-based crypto sentiment studies are reported. The claim that 'whether LLM-derived sentiment signals provide statistically significant alpha after transaction costs remains largely unanswered' is a reasonable observation but should be supported by citing the studies that have attempted this and documenting their limitations.\n\nThe MEV section is the paper's strongest contribution but would benefit from quantitative grounding. The claim about 'billions of dollars in cumulative extracted value' from Flashbots data should include a specific figure with a date and citation. The discussion of RL for MEV bot optimization is plausible but not supported by any specific reference to a paper demonstrating this. The interaction between AI liquidity provision and MEV extraction is an interesting observation that could be developed further with reference to empirical studies.\n\nThe citation situation remains problematic. The reference list contains 11 entries, of which several are tangential to the paper's stated focus (smart cities, auditing, general ChatGPT review), several are arXiv preprints that may have since been published in peer-reviewed venues, and two appear to be the same paper. The authors committed to adding approximately 15 specific foundational references; essentially none of these appear in the revision. This is the single most disappointing aspect of the revision, as it was the most straightforward commitment to fulfill.\n\nIn summary, the paper has improved from a 3.7 to approximately a 5 on my scale\u2014the structural focus is better, the MEV content adds value, and the backtesting critique is directionally correct. But the absence of the promised comparison table, the still-weak citation base, and the lack of specific documented examples in the backtesting critique prevent this from reaching the threshold of a publishable methodological contribution. A third revision that delivers on the specific commitments made in the author response\u2014particularly the comparison table and the updated references\u2014could bring this to a 6.5-7 range.",

    "meta_review": "The manuscript has shown meaningful improvement from Round 1 (3.7\u21925.2), demonstrating genuine engagement with reviewer feedback. The refocused scope around backtesting methodology critique and MEV/market microstructure is a sound editorial choice, and the new Section 3 content on MEV extraction, sandwich attacks, and AMM dynamics represents substantive technical contribution. The reflexivity argument is better integrated, and the regulatory discussion has been materially upgraded. These improvements are real and should be acknowledged.\n\nHowever, the remaining problems are not minor presentation issues\u2014they are fundamental to the manuscript's claimed contribution and structural integrity. Both reviewers independently identify the same critical failures: (1) the promised structured comparison table, which the authors themselves identified as the 'core analytical contribution,' was never delivered, leaving the backtesting critique as a qualitative enumeration of known pitfalls rather than an evidence-based systematic review; (2) the reference list is severely deficient, with most explicitly promised foundational citations absent, duplicate entries, non-sequential numbering, tangential sources retained, and in-text mentions (Daian et al.) lacking corresponding reference entries; and (3) the completeness warning flags a truncated manuscript missing its conclusion section and ending mid-sentence. A structurally incomplete manuscript cannot be accepted regardless of content quality. These are not nitpicks or unreasonable demands\u2014they represent broken promises from the author response, basic scholarly standards for citation integrity, and fundamental manuscript completeness.\n\nThe reviewers are applying appropriate standards. The backtesting critique without specific documented examples from the literature and without the promised comparison table does not constitute a sufficient contribution beyond what is already well-known in the quantitative finance community. The 1.5-point improvement, while encouraging, has not brought the manuscript to publication readiness. The combination of an incomplete/truncated manuscript, a missing core deliverable that the authors themselves defined as central, and a critically deficient reference list constitutes grounds for rejection at this final round.",
