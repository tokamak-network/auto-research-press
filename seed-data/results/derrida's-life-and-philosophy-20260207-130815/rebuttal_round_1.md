## Author Rebuttal - Round 1

### Overview

We sincerely thank all three reviewers for their careful reading and substantive engagement with our manuscript. The feedback has been invaluable in identifying significant gaps and weaknesses that we had not adequately appreciated. We are grateful for the time and expertise invested in these reviews.

The reviewers converge on several critical concerns: (1) insufficient institutional and intellectual-historical context, particularly regarding the ENS milieu and Derrida's relationships with contemporaries; (2) inadequate treatment of key concepts, especially the absence of pharmakon and underdeveloped exposition of différance; (3) a seriously deficient citation apparatus, including an irrelevant astrophysics reference and lack of engagement with standard Derrida scholarship; and (4) failure to address Derrida's reception in literary studies, particularly the Yale School connection. We accept these criticisms as largely valid and propose substantial revisions. The consistent scores across reviewers (averaging 5.2-5.7) confirm that while our manuscript achieves basic clarity and accuracy, it falls short of the scholarly depth required. Our revision strategy involves significant expansion of institutional context, addition of new sections on intellectual relationships and literary theory reception, complete overhaul of the citation apparatus, and deeper engagement with primary texts and established secondary scholarship.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (20th Century French Intellectual History)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate this reviewer's score of 5.2/10 and recognize that the manuscript's treatment of institutional and intellectual-historical context is indeed "superficial." The reviewer's expertise in this area has revealed gaps we must address.

**Major Points**:

1. **Underdeveloped treatment of institutional history (ENS, EHESS, agrégation system)**
   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely valid. We failed to convey the specific intellectual atmosphere of the rue d'Ulm and the institutional structures that shaped Derrida's formation. The omission of Althusser's role as caïman is particularly significant, as is our failure to mention Derrida's two failed entrance examinations—a detail that illuminates the institutional pressures he navigated.
   - **Action taken**: We will substantially expand Section 2.3 to include: (a) detailed discussion of Althusser's influence and the ENS intellectual milieu of the 1950s; (b) explanation of the agrégation system and its role in French philosophical training; (c) the significance of Derrida's delayed thesis defense in 1980; (d) the founding and significance of GREPH and the Collège international de philosophie as institutional interventions.

2. **Absence of engagement with intellectual relationships and debates**
   - **Our response**: We accept this as a major lacuna. A comprehensive account of Derrida cannot omit the Derrida-Foucault rupture, the Searle debate, or the complex inheritance from Levinas. Our passing mention of "analytic philosophy's response" was inadequate.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a dedicated section (proposed Section 4: "Intellectual Relationships and Debates") addressing: (a) the 1963 "Cogito and the History of Madness" lecture and Foucault's response; (b) the sustained Derrida-Searle exchange over speech act theory, with proper treatment of *Limited Inc*; (c) Derrida's relationship to Levinas and the ethical turn; (d) positioning vis-à-vis structuralism and the Tel Quel group.

3. **The 1966 Johns Hopkins conference**
   - **Our response**: The omission of "The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man" conference is a significant oversight, given its importance for Derrida's American reception and the landmark "Structure, Sign, and Play" paper.
   - **Action taken**: We will add substantial treatment of this conference in the new section on intellectual relationships, discussing both its immediate impact and its role in establishing deconstruction's American trajectory.

4. **Problematic citation apparatus (irrelevant Reference [3], missing standard scholarship)**
   - **Our response**: We must acknowledge that Reference [3] on space interferometry is indeed entirely irrelevant. We cannot adequately explain its inclusion and accept full responsibility for this error. Reference [4] on extraterrestrial life, while we had intended a connection to questions of alterity and the limits of the human, is too tangential to justify its prominence.
   - **Action taken**: We will remove Reference [3] entirely and either remove or significantly contextualize Reference [4]. We will add engagement with: Peeters' biography (2010), Bennington's work, Gasché's *The Tain of the Mirror*, and Lawlor's scholarship. Primary texts will be properly cited with specific editions and translations.

**Minor Points**: We will incorporate the reviewer's suggestion to discuss the 1967 trilogy (*Of Grammatology*, *Writing and Difference*, *Speech and Phenomena*) with direct engagement rather than secondary summaries.

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Continental Philosophy and Deconstruction Theory)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank this reviewer for the score of 5.7/10 and the detailed philosophical critique. The observation that our treatment "lacks the technical depth expected for serious scholarly engagement" is fair, and the specific suggestions for improvement are invaluable.

**Major Points**:

1. **Superficial treatment of différance**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that our exposition misses crucial dimensions. Our formulation focusing on "differ and defer" fails to convey that différance is, as Derrida insists, neither word nor concept but something "older" than Being itself. We did not adequately address its relationship to Saussurean linguistics or Heideggerian ontological difference.
   - **Action taken**: We will substantially revise the différance exposition to include: (a) the fourfold operation (spatial differing, temporal deferring, production of differences, movement of the trace); (b) its relationship to Derrida's reading of Saussure's arbitrary sign; (c) its distinction from Heideggerian ontological difference; (d) its status as neither word nor concept, with appropriate citations from "Différance" in *Margins of Philosophy*.

2. **Complete absence of pharmakon**
   - **Our response**: This is a significant oversight that we cannot defend. "Plato's Pharmacy" is essential for understanding Derrida's deconstructive reading practice, and the pharmakon's undecidability between remedy and poison exemplifies the destabilization of binary hierarchies central to deconstruction.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a substantial subsection on pharmakon within the discussion of key concepts, analyzing how this figure demonstrates Derrida's method of locating points of textual undecidability that unsettle the texts' apparent arguments.

3. **Critique of logocentrism lacks textual grounding**
   - **Our response**: We accept that presenting the critique without engaging Derrida's actual readings of Plato, Rousseau, Saussure, and Husserl makes it appear as "mere assertion rather than demonstrated analysis."
   - **Action taken**: We will ground the discussion of logocentrism and phonocentrism in specific textual readings, particularly from *Of Grammatology* (the Rousseau reading) and *Speech and Phenomena* (the Husserl critique).

4. **Underdeveloped treatment of the "theological turn"**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer rightly notes the risk of misrepresenting the relationship between deconstruction and negative theology. Derrida's careful distinctions in "How to Avoid Speaking" and elsewhere require more nuanced treatment.
   - **Action taken**: We will revise this section to properly distinguish Derrida's position from negative theology, engaging directly with "How to Avoid Speaking" and clarifying the specific sense in which deconstruction relates to questions of the messianic and the "to come."

5. **Citation apparatus inadequacies**
   - **Our response**: As noted above, Reference [3] is indefensible. We also accept that relying on secondary sources (Maleuvre, Long) without direct engagement with primary texts is insufficient.
   - **Action taken**: We will add proper citations from *Of Grammatology* (Spivak translation), *Speech and Phenomena*, "Différance," "Signature Event Context," and *Limited Inc*. Secondary scholarship by Gasché, Bennington, Spivak, and Caputo will be incorporated.

**Minor Points**: We will ensure that our claim to provide a "comprehensive account" is either substantiated by expanded scope or appropriately qualified.

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Humanities)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate this reviewer's score of 5.3/10 and recognize the "curious imbalance" identified: competent philosophical survey but failure to address Derrida's transformative impact on literary studies. This gap is particularly problematic given our stated interdisciplinary scope.

**Major Points**:

1. **Omission of the Yale School and American literary theory reception**
   - **Our response**: This criticism identifies what may be the manuscript's most significant gap. The Yale School connection was "arguably the most significant institutional vector for deconstruction's dissemination in the Anglophone world," and its absence undermines any claim to comprehensiveness.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a substantial new section on Derrida's reception in literary studies, including: (a) the Yale School (de Man, Hartman, Miller, Bloom) and their distinctive appropriations of deconstruction; (b) the *Deconstruction and Criticism* volume (1979) as a watershed moment; (c) de Man's relationship to Derrida's work and their differences; (d) the de Man affair and its implications for deconstruction's reception. This is a significant addition that will require careful research and approximately 800-1000 additional words.

2. **Problematic citation apparatus**
   - **Our response**: We reiterate our acceptance of this criticism. The reviewer's suggestion that Reference [3] indicates "either a citation error or fabrication" is understandable given its complete irrelevance. We assure the reviewer this was an error, not fabrication, but we take full responsibility for this serious lapse in scholarly care.
   - **Action taken**: Complete overhaul of citations as described above, with specific addition of Spivak's preface to *Of Grammatology*, which the reviewer rightly identifies as essential.

3. **Superficial treatment of interdisciplinary applications**
   - **Our response**: The single brief paragraph on law, architecture, and cultural studies is indeed inadequate. Mentioning these applications without substantive analysis or specific examples fails to demonstrate actual engagement with these fields.
   - **Action taken**: We will significantly expand Section 5.2 to include: (a) the Parc de la Villette collaboration with Tschumi and the "Point de Folie" essay; (b) *Chora L Works* with Eisenman; (c) "Force of Law" and its significance for critical legal studies, including engagement with Drucilla Cornell's work; (d) specific applications in postcolonial theory (Spivak's "Can the Subaltern Speak?") and cultural studies (Bhabha's work on hybridity).

**Minor Points**: We accept the characterization of our manuscript as reading "as a solid encyclopedia entry rather than research contributing new insights." While we believe there is value in clear synthesis, we will work to identify areas where our analysis can offer more original contribution, or alternatively, will more modestly frame our aims as introductory synthesis rather than claiming comprehensiveness.
