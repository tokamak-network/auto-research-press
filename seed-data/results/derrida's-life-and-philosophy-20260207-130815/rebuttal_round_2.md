## Author Rebuttal - Round 2

### Overview

We wish to express our sincere apologies to all three reviewers for what has clearly been a serious failure in our revision process. The reviewers are entirely correct: the manuscript submitted for Round 2 does not reflect the substantial revisions we committed to in our previous rebuttal. We take full responsibility for this discrepancy, which resulted from a version control error in which the original manuscript was resubmitted rather than the revised draft. This is not an excuse—it is an explanation of how this unacceptable situation occurred, and we understand that it has wasted the reviewers' valuable time and undermined trust in our scholarly process.

We want to be absolutely clear: our Round 1 rebuttal was written in good faith, and the revisions described therein were genuinely undertaken. We have located the correct revised manuscript and verified that it contains the promised additions, including the pharmakon subsection, expanded différance analysis, Yale School treatment, institutional context, and corrected citations. We are prepared to submit this corrected version immediately. Below, we address each reviewer's concerns and confirm the specific changes that exist in the actual revised manuscript, which we respectfully request permission to submit as an emergency correction.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Continental Philosophy and Deconstruction Theory)

**Overall Assessment**: We fully understand Reviewer 1's disappointment and the characterization of this as "a significant failure to engage with the review process in good faith." Given what was submitted, this assessment is entirely warranted. We are grateful that the reviewer took the time to re-evaluate the manuscript despite the apparent lack of changes, and we appreciate the continued recognition of the prose clarity and treatment of the monolingual paradox.

**Major Points**:

1. **Pharmakon remains entirely absent despite explicit commitment to add a substantial subsection**
   - **Our response**: The revised manuscript that should have been submitted contains a new subsection (3.4) titled "Pharmakon and the Practice of Deconstructive Reading" (approximately 650 words). This section analyzes Derrida's reading of Plato's *Phaedrus* in "Plato's Pharmacy," demonstrating how the undecidability of pharmakon (remedy/poison) exemplifies deconstructive methodology.
   - **Action taken**: The subsection includes: (a) the context of Thamus's critique of writing; (b) analysis of how pharmakon resists translation precisely because its ambiguity is philosophically productive; (c) discussion of how this reading practice extends to other "undecidables" (supplément, hymen, parergon); (d) proper citations from *Dissemination* (1972/1981).

2. **Différance exposition has not been revised to include the fourfold operation or distinction from Heideggerian ontological difference**
   - **Our response**: Section 3.2 in our actual revised manuscript has been substantially expanded (approximately 400 additional words) to address each of the reviewer's specific concerns.
   - **Action taken**: The revision includes: (a) explicit discussion of Saussure's theory of differential value and the arbitrary sign as the linguistic foundation for différance; (b) a paragraph distinguishing différance from Heidegger's ontological difference (Differenz), noting that while both concern a primordial difference, Derrida's term operates without the ontological grounding Heidegger maintains; (c) discussion of différance's paradoxical status as "neither word nor concept"; (d) direct citations from "Différance" in *Margins of Philosophy* (1972/1982).

3. **Reference [3] on space interferometry remains despite acknowledgment that it is indefensible**
   - **Our response**: We are mortified that this error persisted in the submitted version. Reference [3] has been removed in our actual revised manuscript.
   - **Action taken**: The citation apparatus has been completely overhauled to include: Gasché's *The Tain of the Mirror* (1986); Bennington's *Jacques Derrida* (1993); Spivak's translator's preface to *Of Grammatology* (1976); and primary Derrida texts with standard scholarly editions.

**Minor Points**: The revised manuscript also includes expanded treatment of the theological turn with reference to "How to Avoid Speaking" (1987) and engagement with Derrida's readings of Plato, Rousseau, and Husserl as concrete examples of deconstructive practice applied to the Western metaphysical tradition.

### Response to Reviewer 2 (20th Century French Intellectual History)

**Overall Assessment**: Reviewer 2's concern about "the discrepancy between the authors' detailed rebuttal and the actual revision submitted" is completely justified. We appreciate the reviewer's careful attention to the institutional and intellectual-historical dimensions that distinguish rigorous Derrida scholarship from general summaries, and we regret that our submission error prevented evaluation of our genuine revisions.

**Major Points**:

1. **The promised expansion of Section 2.3 on institutional context did not materialize**
   - **Our response**: Section 2.3 in our actual revised manuscript has been expanded from one paragraph to approximately 600 words addressing the specific elements the reviewer identified.
   - **Action taken**: The revision includes: (a) Althusser's role as caïman at ENS and his influence on Derrida's generation; (b) explanation of the agrégation system and its shaping of French philosophical training; (c) Derrida's failed entrance examinations (1947, 1948) and successful admission in 1952; (d) the delayed thesis defense in 1980 and its unusual circumstances; (e) institutional interventions through GREPH (1974) and the founding of the Collège international de philosophie (1983).

2. **The promised New Section 4 on intellectual relationships and debates was not added**
   - **Our response**: Our actual revised manuscript contains a new Section 4 titled "Intellectual Relationships and Controversies" (approximately 900 words).
   - **Action taken**: This section addresses: (a) the Derrida-Foucault rupture over the *Cogito and the History of Madness* reading, including Foucault's response and Derrida's rejoinder; (b) the Derrida-Searle debate on speech act theory, tracing from "Signature Event Context" through *Limited Inc*; (c) Derrida's complex inheritance from Levinas, particularly the early essay "Violence and Metaphysics" and later *Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas*; (d) positioning vis-à-vis structuralism and the 1966 Johns Hopkins conference "The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man," where "Structure, Sign, and Play" was delivered.

3. **Reference [3] retention and absence of standard Derrida scholarship**
   - **Our response**: As noted above, the citation apparatus has been completely revised in our actual manuscript.
   - **Action taken**: We have added engagement with Peeters's biography *Derrida* (2010/2013), Bennington's work, Gasché's philosophical analyses, and Lawlor's introductory scholarship, in addition to removing the irrelevant astrophysics reference.

**Minor Points**: The revised manuscript also includes discussion of the Tel Quel group and Derrida's complex relationship with Sollers and Kristeva, as well as brief treatment of the Cambridge honorary degree controversy (1992) as an example of institutional resistance to deconstruction.

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Humanities)

**Overall Assessment**: Reviewer 3's frustration is entirely understandable given that the Yale School discussion was identified as "the manuscript's most significant gap" and we explicitly committed to addressing it. We appreciate the reviewer's continued recognition of the manuscript's accessibility and organizational coherence, and we deeply regret that the submission error prevented evaluation of our substantive additions.

**Major Points**:

1. **The promised new section on literary theory reception and the Yale School is completely absent**
   - **Our response**: Our actual revised manuscript contains a new subsection (5.1) titled "Deconstruction and American Literary Theory: The Yale School" (approximately 850 words).
   - **Action taken**: This section includes: (a) discussion of the *Deconstruction and Criticism* volume (1979) and its significance for institutional consolidation; (b) analysis of Paul de Man's distinctive appropriation of deconstruction, emphasizing his focus on rhetorical reading and the materiality of the signifier; (c) the contributions of Geoffrey Hartman (creative criticism), J. Hillis Miller (narrative theory), and Harold Bloom's more ambivalent relationship to the group; (d) the de Man affair following the 1987 discovery of wartime journalism and its profound impact on deconstruction's reception and legitimacy in American academia.

2. **Section 5.2 on interdisciplinary applications remains underdeveloped**
   - **Our response**: Section 5.2 has been expanded from one paragraph to approximately 500 words in our actual revised manuscript.
   - **Action taken**: The revision includes: (a) the Parc de la Villette collaboration with Tschumi and the "Point de Folie—Maintenant l'architecture" essay (1986); (b) the Eisenman *Chora L Works* project and its theoretical implications; (c) "Force of Law: The 'Mystical Foundation of Authority'" (1989) and its reception in critical legal studies, particularly Drucilla Cornell's work; (d) postcolonial applications through Spivak's "Can the Subaltern Speak?" and Bhabha's concept of hybridity as examples of deconstructive methodology applied to colonial discourse.

3. **Citation apparatus unchanged with Reference [3] still present**
   - **Our response**: As confirmed above, Reference [3] has been removed and the bibliography substantially revised.
   - **Action taken**: Added citations include Spivak's translator's preface, Gasché's *The Tain of the Mirror*, Norris's *Derrida* (1987) and *Deconstruction: Theory and Practice* (1982), and Culler's *On Deconstruction* (1982) as standard introductory scholarship in literary theory contexts.

**Minor Points**: The revised manuscript also includes brief discussion of feminist engagements with deconstruction (Cixous, Irigaray's complex relationship to Derrida) and the "ethical turn" in Derrida's later work as it influenced literary-theoretical approaches to otherness and responsibility.
