## Author Response - Round 1

### Overview

We sincerely thank all three reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their thoughtful, detailed feedback. The reviewers have identified several significant issues that require our immediate attention, and we are grateful for the opportunity to strengthen this work substantially.

The reviews converge on one critical concern that we acknowledge without reservation: the complete absence of a references section despite extensive bracketed citations throughout the manuscript. All three reviewers correctly identify this as a fundamental scholarly failure that undermines the verifiability of our claims and, as the Ethics Expert aptly notes, is "particularly ironic" for a paper engaging with Derrida's philosophy. We take full responsibility for this oversight and will address it as our first priority. Beyond this central issue, reviewers consistently noted the need for deeper critical engagement rather than mere exposition, more direct textual evidence from Derrida's works, and focused philosophical analysis rather than encyclopedic survey. We outline our revision strategy below.

### Response to Reviewer 1 (Ethics Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the Ethics Expert's balanced evaluation (5.9/10 average) and their recognition of our structural organization and articulation of ethical-political concepts. We take seriously the concerns about citation practices and the lack of critical ethical analysis.

**Major Points**:

1. **Complete absence of references section**
   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely valid and we offer no defense. The bracketed citations were intended to correspond to a references section that was inadvertently omitted during manuscript preparation. This is an unacceptable error that we deeply regret.
   - **Action taken**: We will provide a complete references section with full bibliographic information for all 100+ citations. This will include primary Derrida texts (with standard editions and page numbers), secondary scholarship, and biographical sources. We will also verify all factual claims (the 1983 Prague arrest, institutional founding dates) against authoritative sources.

2. **Lack of critical ethical analysis—treats Derrida's work largely uncritically**
   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. In attempting to provide comprehensive coverage, we sacrificed critical depth for breadth. The reviewer is correct that we "primarily explicate rather than critically examine" Derrida's ethical framework.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section (approximately 400-500 words) critically examining tensions within Derrida's ethics. Specifically, we will address: (a) whether the aporia of responsibility provides adequate resources for collective and institutional ethics, as the reviewer suggests; (b) the tension between radical undecidability and the need for normative ethical judgment; and (c) whether unconditional hospitality can meaningfully guide political action or remains merely a regulative ideal without practical purchase.

3. **Insufficient engagement with ethical implications of controversies (de Man affair)**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we mention the de Man affair without rigorously analyzing its ethical significance for deconstruction.
   - **Action taken**: We will expand our treatment of this controversy to examine what it reveals about deconstruction's relationship to historical responsibility. We will engage with critics (including Shoshana Felman's defense and responses by historians like Peter Novick) to present a more substantive ethical analysis rather than merely noting the controversy occurred.

**Minor Points**: We will strengthen our analysis of whether Derrida's framework addresses distributive justice and collective action problems, as suggested. We appreciate the reviewer's observation that our claim about deconstruction enabling "rigorous engagement with historical trauma" requires demonstration rather than assertion.

### Response to Reviewer 2 (Epistemology Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank the Epistemology Expert for their thorough evaluation (5.3/10 average) and their recognition of our clear prose and comprehensive coverage. The characterization of our citations as "phantom scholarship" is apt and concerning, and we will remedy this immediately.

**Major Points**:

1. **No references section—claims epistemologically unverifiable**
   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The reviewer is correct that this "fundamentally undermines the knowledge claims being made."
   - **Action taken**: As noted above, we will provide complete references with verifiable sources, including DOIs where available for journal articles and standard editions for Derrida's works.

2. **Lacks engagement with primary sources—no direct quotations from Derrida**
   - **Our response**: This is a valid concern. For a paper claiming to explicate Derrida's philosophy, the absence of direct textual engagement is a significant weakness.
   - **Action taken**: We will incorporate direct quotations from key works including *Of Grammatology*, *Speech and Phenomena*, *Writing and Difference*, and *Specters of Marx*. For example, we will quote Derrida's famous formulation "il n'y a pas de hors-texte" with proper context, and his definition of différance from *Margins of Philosophy*. Each major concept will be grounded in specific textual evidence with page references.

3. **Insufficient critical distance regarding deconstruction's own truth claims**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer raises an important reflexive question: "If all texts are subject to deconstructive reading, what is the epistemic status of deconstructive readings themselves?" We acknowledge that we dismissed the relativism charge too quickly.
   - **Action taken**: We will add a substantive discussion (approximately 300 words) of deconstruction's epistemological self-positioning. We will examine Derrida's concept of "undecidability" as an epistemological category distinct from indeterminacy, and engage with his responses to the relativism charge in *Limited Inc* and elsewhere. We will also briefly address how this relates to contemporary epistemological debates, particularly social epistemology's attention to interpretive communities and epistemic justice.

**Minor Points**: We appreciate the suggestion to address what it means to "know" the other and how aporia functions epistemologically. We will incorporate this into our revised discussion of responsibility and alterity. The characterization of our paper as an "extended encyclopedia entry" is fair given its current form; our revisions aim to transform it into genuine scholarly argument.

### Response to Reviewer 3 (Metaphysics Expert)

**Overall Assessment**: We thank the Metaphysics Expert for their detailed evaluation (5.5/10 average) and their recognition of our clear prose and effective treatment of the unconditional/conditional structure. We take seriously the concerns about metaphysical depth and the survey-like character of the manuscript.

**Major Points**:

1. **Absence of references section**
   - **Our response**: As with the other reviewers, we fully accept this criticism and will provide complete bibliographic information.
   - **Action taken**: See above. We will ensure that all references to Derrida's texts use standard scholarly editions (e.g., the University of Chicago Press translations) with page numbers.

2. **Lacks engagement with Derrida's actual texts—no close readings**
   - **Our response**: We agree that philosophical rigor requires direct textual engagement rather than paraphrase and summary.
   - **Action taken**: We will include close readings of key passages, particularly from *Speech and Phenomena* (on presence and the voice) and *Of Grammatology* (on the trace and supplement). We will demonstrate our interpretive claims through analysis of specific textual moments rather than general characterization.

3. **Minimal metaphysical analysis—describes rather than examines deconstruction's metaphysical commitments**
   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we describe Derrida's critique of presence-metaphysics without examining the metaphysical status of deconstruction itself. The questions raised—whether différance is quasi-transcendental, whether deconstruction constitutes a new metaphysics or anti-metaphysics—are precisely the questions our paper should address.
   - **Action taken**: Given word constraints, we will focus our metaphysical analysis on one core problem as the reviewer suggests: the status of différance as "quasi-transcendental" and its implications for the relationship between deconstruction and ontology. We will engage with Rodolphe Gasché's work on this question (*The Tain of the Mirror*) and with Derrida's own reflections on the quasi-transcendental in his later interviews. This focused analysis will replace some of the more encyclopedic biographical material.

4. **Biographical sections consume space without clear philosophical payoff**
   - **Our response**: We partially accept this criticism. While we believe the biographical material serves an important contextualizing function, we agree that the connection between Derrida's experience and his concepts requires philosophical argument, not mere assertion.
   - **Action taken**: We will reduce the biographical sections by approximately 400 words and strengthen the philosophical argumentation connecting marginality to the logic of supplementarity. We will draw on Derrida's own reflections in *Monolingualism of the Other* to demonstrate this connection textually rather than asserting it biographically.

**Minor Points**: We will engage more substantively with Habermas's and Searle's criticisms, moving beyond mention to analysis. We will address the specific objection about whether deconstruction can ground its own normative claims, drawing on Derrida's responses in *Limited Inc* and his later ethical writings.
