However, it suffers from a critical flaw: the extensive use of bracketed citations [1], [2], etc. without any corresponding references section, making it impossible to verify claims or assess source quality. The ethical dimensions are well-articulated but lack the critical engagement and original analysis expected even in a short paper.",

        "Strengthen the ethical analysis of controversies: examine what the de Man affair reveals about deconstruction's relationship to historical responsibility, or critically assess whether Derrida's aporia concept provides adequate guidance for concrete ethical decisions"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From an ethics perspective, this manuscript demonstrates solid understanding of Derrida's ethical-political concepts but falls short of the critical engagement necessary for scholarly contribution. The exposition of concepts like unconditional hospitality, justice beyond law, and the aporia of responsibility is clear and accurate. However, the paper primarily explicates rather than critically examines these ideas. For instance, the discussion of responsibility through the Abraham-Isaac narrative correctly identifies Derrida's claim that 'every ethical decision involves a kind of sacrifice,' but doesn't interrogate whether this framework adequately addresses collective responsibility, institutional ethics, or questions of distributive justice. The treatment of controversies is particularly weak from an ethical standpoint: the de Man affair is mentioned but the profound ethical questions it raises about textuality, historical responsibility, and the relationship between deconstruction and political accountability are not rigorously explored. Similarly, the manuscript asserts that deconstruction 'enables rather than forecloses rigorous engagement with historical trauma' but doesn't demonstrate how or address critics who argue that radical undecidability undermines normative ethical judgment. Most critically, the complete absence of a references section despite extensive bracketed citations represents a fundamental failure of scholarly ethics\u2014readers cannot verify claims, assess source quality, or trace the intellectual lineage of arguments. This is especially problematic given that some claims (about Derrida's 1983 arrest in Prague, specific institutional founding dates) require verification. For a paper on ethics, this citation practice is particularly ironic and problematic. The manuscript would benefit from: (1) adding complete references; (2) developing critical ethical analysis rather than mere exposition; (3) engaging substantively with debates about whether Derrida's ethics provides adequate resources for addressing concrete injustices, systemic oppression, or collective action problems; and (4) examining tensions within Derrida's own ethical framework more rigorously.",

        "Add a critical section examining epistemological challenges to deconstruction: How does Derrida's critique of presence affect knowledge claims? What is deconstruction's relationship to truth? How do we adjudicate between competing interpretations?"
      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From an epistemological perspective, this manuscript presents a significant paradox: it makes extensive knowledge claims about Derrida's philosophy while providing no verifiable evidentiary basis for those claims. The numbered citations [1], [2], etc. appear throughout but reference nothing, creating what might be called 'phantom scholarship'\u2014the appearance of rigorous documentation without its substance. This is particularly problematic given that epistemology centrally concerns the justification of knowledge claims. How can readers verify that Derrida actually said what is attributed to him? How can we distinguish accurate interpretation from misreading? The paper's treatment of Derrida's epistemological positions is also underdeveloped. While it accurately describes his critique of presence and logocentrism, it doesn't adequately address the reflexive epistemological questions this raises: If all texts are subject to deconstructive reading, what is the epistemic status of deconstructive readings themselves? The paper mentions that Derrida was accused of relativism (p. 13) but dismisses this too quickly without engaging the substantive epistemological challenge. A more rigorous treatment would examine how deconstruction navigates between foundationalism and relativism, perhaps engaging with Derrida's concept of 'undecidability' as an epistemological category distinct from mere indeterminacy. The paper would also benefit from addressing how Derrida's work relates to contemporary epistemology\u2014virtue epistemology, social epistemology, or feminist epistemology. The discussion of 'justice' and 'responsibility' has ethical-political dimensions but also epistemological ones: What does it mean to 'know' the other? How does the 'aporia' function epistemologically? Despite these significant issues, the paper demonstrates solid understanding of Derrida's major concepts and their development. The writing is clear and the structure logical. With proper citations and deeper epistemological engagement, this could become a strong contribution. As it stands, it reads more like an extended encyclopedia entry than scholarly research.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From a metaphysical perspective, this manuscript presents a significant paradox: it discusses a philosopher centrally concerned with textuality and the materiality of writing while failing to provide verifiable textual references. The numbered citations [1], [2], etc. appear throughout but lead nowhere, which is particularly problematic for a paper about a thinker who insisted on rigorous close reading. This raises serious concerns about scholarly integrity and makes peer review impossible in the traditional sense.\n\nRegarding metaphysical content, the paper accurately describes Derrida's critique of presence-metaphysics and his key concepts (diff\u00e9rance, trace, supplement), but remains largely at the level of exposition rather than analysis. A stronger metaphysical engagement would examine: (1) the ontological status of diff\u00e9rance itself\u2014is it quasi-transcendental, and what does this mean for metaphysics? (2) whether deconstruction constitutes a new metaphysics or an anti-metaphysics, (3) how Derrida's work relates to other 20th-century critiques of metaphysics (Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Quine), and (4) the coherence of claiming to critique metaphysics while necessarily employing metaphysical concepts.\n\nThe treatment of the unconditional/conditional structure is the paper's strongest metaphysical contribution, but even here, deeper analysis is needed. What are the metaphysical presuppositions of this aporetic structure? How does it relate to traditional metaphysical problems of universals and particulars, essence and existence? The paper mentions that justice 'differs absolutely' from law and that diff\u00e9rance is 'neither a word nor a concept,' but doesn't rigorously examine what these negative formulations entail metaphysically.\n\nFor a short paper, focusing on one metaphysical problem would be more effective than this survey approach. For example, a deep analysis of the trace-structure and its implications for theories of presence, identity, and temporality would demonstrate philosophical rigor while remaining within word limits. The current manuscript reads more like an encyclopedia entry than a philosophical argument.\n\nThe biographical sections, while interesting, consume significant space without clear philosophical payoff. The connection between Derrida's Algerian experience and his philosophical concepts is asserted but not rigorously demonstrated. How exactly does colonial marginality translate into the logic of supplementarity? This requires philosophical argument, not just biographical narrative.\n\nFinally, the paper would benefit from engaging critics more substantively. The mentions of Habermas, Searle, and others are superficial. A rigorous metaphysical analysis would address specific objections: Does deconstruction collapse into relativism? Can it provide grounds for its own normative claims? What is the relationship between the empirical and transcendental in Derrida's thought?\n\nIn summary: add complete references immediately, engage primary texts directly with quotations, narrow the scope to develop one metaphysical argument in depth, and transform exposition into analysis. The writing quality is good, but scholarly apparatus and philosophical rigor need substantial improvement.",

    "meta_review": "All three reviewers converge on a fundamental problem that I must take seriously: the manuscript contains extensive numbered citations (100+) with no corresponding references section. This is not a minor formatting issue\u2014it represents a critical scholarly deficiency that undermines the epistemological foundation of the entire work. While reviewers may sometimes be overly demanding about novelty or theoretical contribution, their concern here is entirely legitimate and substantive. A paper making claims about a philosopher's work that cannot be verified against sources fails basic scholarly standards regardless of venue type.\n\nThat said, the reviewers also consistently praise the manuscript's genuine strengths: clear exposition, effective organization, accessible treatment of complex concepts, and thoughtful integration of biographical and philosophical dimensions. The average score of 5.6 reflects a paper with real merit that is currently unpublishable due to a fixable but serious deficiency. This is not a case of reviewers demanding groundbreaking novelty from what appears to be an expository/survey piece\u2014they are correctly identifying that even excellent exposition requires verifiable sourcing.\n\nGiven this is Round 1 of 2, major revision is appropriate. The core issue (missing references) is entirely fixable, and the secondary concerns (lack of direct quotations, insufficient critical engagement) are reasonable requests that would elevate the work from competent survey to genuine scholarly contribution. The author has demonstrated capability in organization and clarity; they now need to demonstrate scholarly rigor through proper documentation and deeper textual engagement.",

  "author_response": "## Author Response - Round 1\n\n### Overview\n\nWe sincerely thank all three reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their thoughtful, detailed feedback. The reviewers have identified several significant issues that require our immediate attention, and we are grateful for the opportunity to strengthen this work substantially.\n\nThe reviews converge on one critical concern that we acknowledge without reservation: the complete absence of a references section despite extensive bracketed citations throughout the manuscript. All three reviewers correctly identify this as a fundamental scholarly failure that undermines the verifiability of our claims and, as the Ethics Expert aptly notes, is \"particularly ironic\" for a paper engaging with Derrida's philosophy. We take full responsibility for this oversight and will address it as our first priority. Beyond this central issue, reviewers consistently noted the need for deeper critical engagement rather than mere exposition, more direct textual evidence from Derrida's works, and focused philosophical analysis rather than encyclopedic survey. We outline our revision strategy below.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 1 (Ethics Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We appreciate the Ethics Expert's balanced evaluation (5.9/10 average) and their recognition of our structural organization and articulation of ethical-political concepts. We take seriously the concerns about citation practices and the lack of critical ethical analysis.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Complete absence of references section**\n   - **Our response**: This criticism is entirely valid and we offer no defense. The bracketed citations were intended to correspond to a references section that was inadvertently omitted during manuscript preparation. This is an unacceptable error that we deeply regret.\n   - **Action taken**: We will provide a complete references section with full bibliographic information for all 100+ citations. This will include primary Derrida texts (with standard editions and page numbers), secondary scholarship, and biographical sources. We will also verify all factual claims (the 1983 Prague arrest, institutional founding dates) against authoritative sources.\n\n2. **Lack of critical ethical analysis\u2014treats Derrida's work largely uncritically**\n   - **Our response**: We accept this criticism. In attempting to provide comprehensive coverage, we sacrificed critical depth for breadth. The reviewer is correct that we \"primarily explicate rather than critically examine\" Derrida's ethical framework.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a new section (approximately 400-500 words) critically examining tensions within Derrida's ethics. Specifically, we will address: (a) whether the aporia of responsibility provides adequate resources for collective and institutional ethics, as the reviewer suggests; (b) the tension between radical undecidability and the need for normative ethical judgment; and (c) whether unconditional hospitality can meaningfully guide political action or remains merely a regulative ideal without practical purchase.\n\n3. **Insufficient engagement with ethical implications of controversies (de Man affair)**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we mention the de Man affair without rigorously analyzing its ethical significance for deconstruction.\n   - **Action taken**: We will expand our treatment of this controversy to examine what it reveals about deconstruction's relationship to historical responsibility. We will engage with critics (including Shoshana Felman's defense and responses by historians like Peter Novick) to present a more substantive ethical analysis rather than merely noting the controversy occurred.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will strengthen our analysis of whether Derrida's framework addresses distributive justice and collective action problems, as suggested. We appreciate the reviewer's observation that our claim about deconstruction enabling \"rigorous engagement with historical trauma\" requires demonstration rather than assertion.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 2 (Epistemology Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the Epistemology Expert for their thorough evaluation (5.3/10 average) and their recognition of our clear prose and comprehensive coverage. The characterization of our citations as \"phantom scholarship\" is apt and concerning, and we will remedy this immediately.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **No references section\u2014claims epistemologically unverifiable**\n   - **Our response**: We fully accept this criticism. The reviewer is correct that this \"fundamentally undermines the knowledge claims being made.\"\n   - **Action taken**: As noted above, we will provide complete references with verifiable sources, including DOIs where available for journal articles and standard editions for Derrida's works.\n\n2. **Lacks engagement with primary sources\u2014no direct quotations from Derrida**\n   - **Our response**: This is a valid concern. For a paper claiming to explicate Derrida's philosophy, the absence of direct textual engagement is a significant weakness.\n   - **Action taken**: We will incorporate direct quotations from key works including *Of Grammatology*, *Speech and Phenomena*, *Writing and Difference*, and *Specters of Marx*. For example, we will quote Derrida's famous formulation \"il n'y a pas de hors-texte\" with proper context, and his definition of diff\u00e9rance from *Margins of Philosophy*. Each major concept will be grounded in specific textual evidence with page references.\n\n3. **Insufficient critical distance regarding deconstruction's own truth claims**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer raises an important reflexive question: \"If all texts are subject to deconstructive reading, what is the epistemic status of deconstructive readings themselves?\" We acknowledge that we dismissed the relativism charge too quickly.\n   - **Action taken**: We will add a substantive discussion (approximately 300 words) of deconstruction's epistemological self-positioning. We will examine Derrida's concept of \"undecidability\" as an epistemological category distinct from indeterminacy, and engage with his responses to the relativism charge in *Limited Inc* and elsewhere. We will also briefly address how this relates to contemporary epistemological debates, particularly social epistemology's attention to interpretive communities and epistemic justice.\n\n**Minor Points**: We appreciate the suggestion to address what it means to \"know\" the other and how aporia functions epistemologically. We will incorporate this into our revised discussion of responsibility and alterity. The characterization of our paper as an \"extended encyclopedia entry\" is fair given its current form; our revisions aim to transform it into genuine scholarly argument.\n\n---\n\n### Response to Reviewer 3 (Metaphysics Expert)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: We thank the Metaphysics Expert for their detailed evaluation (5.5/10 average) and their recognition of our clear prose and effective treatment of the unconditional/conditional structure. We take seriously the concerns about metaphysical depth and the survey-like character of the manuscript.\n\n**Major Points**:\n\n1. **Absence of references section**\n   - **Our response**: As with the other reviewers, we fully accept this criticism and will provide complete bibliographic information.\n   - **Action taken**: See above. We will ensure that all references to Derrida's texts use standard scholarly editions (e.g., the University of Chicago Press translations) with page numbers.\n\n2. **Lacks engagement with Derrida's actual texts\u2014no close readings**\n   - **Our response**: We agree that philosophical rigor requires direct textual engagement rather than paraphrase and summary.\n   - **Action taken**: We will include close readings of key passages, particularly from *Speech and Phenomena* (on presence and the voice) and *Of Grammatology* (on the trace and supplement). We will demonstrate our interpretive claims through analysis of specific textual moments rather than general characterization.\n\n3. **Minimal metaphysical analysis\u2014describes rather than examines deconstruction's metaphysical commitments**\n   - **Our response**: The reviewer correctly identifies that we describe Derrida's critique of presence-metaphysics without examining the metaphysical status of deconstruction itself. The questions raised\u2014whether diff\u00e9rance is quasi-transcendental, whether deconstruction constitutes a new metaphysics or anti-metaphysics\u2014are precisely the questions our paper should address.\n   - **Action taken**: Given word constraints, we will focus our metaphysical analysis on one core problem as the reviewer suggests: the status of diff\u00e9rance as \"quasi-transcendental\" and its implications for the relationship between deconstruction and ontology. We will engage with Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9's work on this question (*The Tain of the Mirror*) and with Derrida's own reflections on the quasi-transcendental in his later interviews. This focused analysis will replace some of the more encyclopedic biographical material.\n\n4. **Biographical sections consume space without clear philosophical payoff**\n   - **Our response**: We partially accept this criticism. While we believe the biographical material serves an important contextualizing function, we agree that the connection between Derrida's experience and his concepts requires philosophical argument, not mere assertion.\n   - **Action taken**: We will reduce the biographical sections by approximately 400 words and strengthen the philosophical argumentation connecting marginality to the logic of supplementarity. We will draw on Derrida's own reflections in *Monolingualism of the Other* to demonstrate this connection textually rather than asserting it biographically.\n\n**Minor Points**: We will engage more substantively with Habermas's and Searle's criticisms, moving beyond mention to analysis. We will address the specific objection about whether deconstruction can ground its own normative claims, drawing on Derrida's responses in *Limited Inc* and his later ethical writings.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Essential Revisions (to be completed immediately)**:\n- Add complete references section with full bibliographic information for all citations, including primary texts, secondary scholarship, and biographical sources\n- Incorporate direct quotations from Derrida's major works with page references\n- Verify all factual claims against authoritative sources\n\n**Major Revisions**:\n- Add critical section examining tensions within Derrida's ethical framework (undecidability vs. normative judgment; unconditional ideals vs. political action)\n- Expand analysis of the de Man affair's implications for deconstruction and historical responsibility\n- Add focused metaphysical analysis of diff\u00e9rance's quasi-transcendental status\n- Develop epistemological discussion of deconstruction's relationship to its own truth claims\n- Engage substantively with critics (Habermas, Searle, and others) rather than merely mentioning them\n\n**Structural Revisions**:\n- Reduce biographical sections by approximately 400 words\n- Strengthen philosophical argumentation connecting biography to concepts\n- Transform expository passages into analytical arguments\n\n**Clarifications**:\n- Demonstrate (rather than assert) how deconstruction enables engagement with historical trauma\n- Clarify the distinction between undecidability and indeterminacy\n- Address relationship between empirical and transcendental in Derrida's thought\n\nWe are committed to addressing all substantive concerns raised by the reviewers and believe these revisions will significantly strengthen the manuscript's scholarly contribution. We thank the reviewers again for their careful attention and constructive criticism.",
