      "detailed_feedback": "From a metaphysics perspective, this revision demonstrates significant improvement in philosophical rigor and scholarly standards. The authors have genuinely engaged with my Round 1 feedback, particularly the critical absence of references and the need for focused metaphysical analysis rather than encyclopedic survey.\n\nThe addition of the quasi-transcendental analysis represents the paper's strongest philosophical contribution. The discussion of how diff\u00e9rance functions neither as fully transcendental nor merely empirical, drawing on Gasch\u00e9's work, shows genuine engagement with the metaphysical stakes of deconstruction. The quotation from Positions\u2014'We have no language...which is foreign to this history'\u2014effectively grounds the claim that deconstruction operates within metaphysics while exposing its limits. This is precisely the kind of textual evidence and philosophical analysis that was missing in Round 1.\n\nHowever, the metaphysical analysis could be pushed further. The paper correctly identifies that diff\u00e9rance creates 'productive instability' by being 'always already implicated in the phenomena it makes possible,' but this formulation deserves more rigorous examination. What does it mean metaphysically for a condition to be implicated in what it conditions? How does this differ from Hegelian dialectical mediation or Heideggerian ontological difference? The paper gestures toward these questions but doesn't fully work through their implications.\n\nThe critical sections represent another major improvement. The discussion of whether deconstruction provides adequate resources for normative judgment shows genuine philosophical engagement rather than mere exposition. The acknowledgment that 'the relationship between unconditional ideals and conditional political realities remains philosophically underdetermined' demonstrates appropriate critical distance. However, some critical claims remain underdeveloped\u2014for instance, the assertion that 'the aporia may be constitutive of ethical life' needs more philosophical argumentation about what this means for the status of ethical norms.\n\nThe references section is now complete and verifiable, with proper citations to primary texts and secondary scholarship. The direct quotations from Derrida's works (Of Grammatology, Margins of Philosophy, Limited Inc, etc.) ground the analysis in textual evidence as requested. This represents a fundamental improvement in scholarly rigor.\n\nFor a short paper (approximately 2,400 words), the scope is now appropriately focused. The decision to concentrate on diff\u00e9rance's quasi-transcendental status rather than attempting comprehensive coverage was wise. The integration of biographical material through Monolingualism of the Other effectively demonstrates connections between experience and concepts rather than merely asserting them.\n\nRemaining limitations include: (1) the ontological implications of diff\u00e9rance could be explored more fully, particularly its relationship to Heidegger's question of being; (2) the discussion of the trace's relationship to traditional metaphysical concepts of causality and temporality remains underdeveloped; (3) some critical sections gesture toward problems without fully working through their philosophical implications.\n\nOverall, this revision transforms what was an extended encyclopedia entry into genuine philosophical scholarship. While not groundbreaking in its contributions, it now demonstrates the rigor, textual engagement, and critical analysis appropriate for academic publication. The authors have taken the feedback seriously and produced a substantially stronger manuscript.",

      "detailed_feedback": "From an epistemological perspective, this revision represents a marked improvement in scholarly rigor and philosophical depth. The authors have genuinely engaged with the Round 1 feedback, most notably by providing a complete, verifiable references section that transforms the manuscript from 'phantom scholarship' to legitimate academic work. The incorporation of direct quotations from primary texts grounds interpretive claims in evidence, and the addition of critical analysis demonstrates philosophical engagement rather than mere exposition.\n\nThe treatment of diff\u00e9rance's quasi-transcendental status is particularly strong, engaging Gasch\u00e9's scholarship to address the metaphysical question of deconstruction's own positioning. The acknowledgment that deconstruction 'cannot claim to stand outside metaphysics while critiquing it' shows philosophical sophistication about the reflexive challenges facing any critique of foundationalism.\n\nHowever, from an epistemological standpoint, some questions remain underdeveloped. While the paper now addresses the relativism charge and distinguishes undecidability from indeterminacy, the positive epistemological account of how deconstructive readings make knowledge claims could be more systematic. The citation from Limited Inc about 'determinate oscillation between possibilities' is helpful but deserves more elaboration\u2014what determines this oscillation? What epistemic constraints operate within deconstructive reading beyond textual evidence and logical argumentation?\n\nThe critical analysis section represents genuine improvement, particularly in acknowledging that 'the criteria for distinguishing better from worse readings within deconstruction remain implicit rather than systematically articulated.' This honest acknowledgment is epistemologically more rigorous than defensive dismissal of the concern. However, the paper could push further here: what would it mean to make these criteria more explicit? Would doing so betray deconstruction's insights, or would it strengthen its epistemological standing?\n\nThe treatment of the de Man affair, while more substantive than Round 1, still feels somewhat incomplete epistemologically. The paper asserts that deconstructive reading 'enables rigorous engagement with historical trauma by attending to what texts suppress and exclude,' but the epistemological mechanism by which this occurs deserves more careful analysis. How does attention to textual instability provide epistemic access to historical truth? What is the relationship between deconstructive reading and historical knowledge?\n\nOverall, this is now a solid scholarly contribution that demonstrates command of primary and secondary literature, engages critically with its subject matter, and meets professional standards for citation and argumentation. For a short paper, it achieves appropriate scope and depth. The remaining epistemological questions are productive rather than fatal\u2014they represent areas for further development rather than fundamental flaws. The manuscript is approaching publication quality, though minor revisions addressing the epistemological criteria for evaluating deconstructive readings would strengthen it further.",

      ],
      "detailed_feedback": "From an ethics perspective, this revision succeeds admirably in transforming an expository survey into genuine philosophical analysis. The authors have taken seriously the Round 1 criticism about treating Derrida's work uncritically and have added substantive engagement with tensions in his ethical framework. The discussion of the aporia between undecidability and normative judgment is particularly strong, correctly identifying that Derrida 'insists that decision occurs precisely where knowledge fails, yet political action requires some basis for choosing between alternatives.' This captures the productive difficulty without resolving it prematurely.\n\nThe engagement with Critchley's criticism regarding collective ethics and institutional transformation demonstrates appropriate scholarly dialogue. However, I would have liked to see this pushed further\u2014the authors acknowledge that 'the relationship between unconditional ideals and conditional political realities remains philosophically underdetermined' but could examine whether this underdetermination is a feature or a bug. Does Derrida's framework provide *any* resources for thinking about distributive justice, institutional design, or collective responsibility? Or does the radical emphasis on singular alterity systematically obscure these dimensions of ethical life?\n\nThe treatment of the de Man affair shows genuine engagement with a difficult controversy, correctly noting that it 'reveals a genuine tension in deconstructive ethics between the commitment to reading against simple moral binaries and the need for clear ethical judgment regarding historical atrocities.' The acknowledgment that 'the relationship between deconstructive reading and historical-ethical judgment remains contested terrain' is appropriately cautious. However, the paper would be strengthened by showing concretely how deconstructive attention to textual exclusions and suppressions operates in practice when confronting historical trauma\u2014perhaps through brief analysis of Derrida's actual readings of testimony or historical documents.\n\nThe epistemological discussion correctly distinguishes Derrida's position from naive relativism and explains undecidability as 'a determinate oscillation between possibilities' rather than 'anything goes.' This is philosophically precise. The admission that 'criteria for distinguishing better from worse readings within deconstruction remain implicit rather than systematically articulated' is honest and important\u2014this is indeed a significant limitation that affects deconstruction's capacity to adjudicate interpretive disputes.\n\nThe metaphysical analysis of diff\u00e9rance's quasi-transcendental status, drawing on Gasch\u00e9, represents a substantial addition that addresses Round 1 concerns about metaphysical depth. The acknowledgment that 'deconstruction cannot claim to stand outside metaphysics while critiquing it, yet this very impossibility of pure exteriority is what deconstruction reveals' correctly captures the reflexive complexity of Derrida's position.\n\nMinor quibbles: The claim that deconstruction 'enables rigorous engagement with historical trauma' (in the de Man section) still requires more demonstration. The discussion of autoimmunity and contemporary relevance, while interesting, feels somewhat tacked on\u2014it could be integrated more organically or expanded into its own analytical moment.\n\nOverall, this is now a strong scholarly contribution that demonstrates mastery of primary sources, engages secondary literature appropriately, and maintains critical distance while explicating Derrida's thought. The authors have responded comprehensively and thoughtfully to Round 1 feedback. For a short paper, this achieves impressive analytical depth while maintaining focus. The remaining weaknesses are matters of degree rather than kind\u2014places where good analysis could become excellent through further development. This manuscript is now suitable for publication with minor revisions.",

    "meta_review": "This manuscript has demonstrated remarkable improvement across the revision process, moving from a score of 5.6 to 7.8\u2014a 2.2-point improvement that reflects genuine engagement with reviewer feedback. The critical failure identified in Round 1 (absence of verifiable references) has been completely resolved, with all three reviewers explicitly confirming that the references section now meets scholarly standards with proper bibliographic information, page numbers, and DOIs. More importantly, the revision has transformed what was apparently an expository piece into a work demonstrating genuine philosophical engagement: direct quotations from primary texts, substantive analysis of diff\u00e9rance's quasi-transcendental status, and critical examination of tensions within Derrida's framework including the de Man affair.\n\nThe remaining weaknesses identified by reviewers are real but represent opportunities for further development rather than fundamental flaws. Reviewers note that the metaphysical analysis could be 'more rigorously developed,' that epistemological criteria for evaluating deconstructive readings could be 'more systematically articulated,' and that the aporetic ethics discussion could 'push harder' on practical implications. These are the kinds of suggestions that could improve any philosophy paper indefinitely\u2014they represent the difference between a good paper and an excellent one, not between an acceptable and unacceptable submission. Notably, all three reviewers use language like 'substantial improvement,' 'commendable,' and 'fully addresses' critical concerns, signaling satisfaction with the revision trajectory.\n\nAs this is the final round, I must weigh whether continued revision would yield meaningful improvement or diminishing returns. The manuscript now meets publication standards for a short paper format: it demonstrates scholarly rigor, engages critically with its subject, provides verifiable sources, and contributes a focused analysis of Derrida's metaphysical and ethical framework. The reviewers' suggestions for expansion (engaging Heidegger more deeply, connecting to contemporary epistemological debates, providing concrete political case studies) would essentially require a longer format.
