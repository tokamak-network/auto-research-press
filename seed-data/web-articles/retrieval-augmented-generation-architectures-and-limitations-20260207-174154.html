### Motivation and Problem Statement

Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in knowledge-intensive applications remains fundamentally constrained by two persistent challenges: the generation of plausible but factually incorrect information, commonly termed hallucination, and the inability to access knowledge beyond their training data cutoff <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-1" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(1)">[1]</a></span>. These limitations carry significant consequences in domains where accuracy is paramount, including medical diagnosis support, legal document analysis, and scientific research assistance. Studies have shown that even the most capable language models produce factual errors in fifteen to twenty-five percent of their responses when addressing knowledge-intensive queries, with error rates increasing substantially for queries requiring recent or specialized information <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-2" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(2)">[2]</a></span>.

Retrieval-augmented generation emerged as a promising architectural paradigm to address these fundamental limitations by grounding language model outputs in retrieved evidence from external knowledge sources <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-3" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(3)">[3]</a></span>. The core premise is elegantly simple: by conditioning generation on relevant retrieved passages, models can produce responses that are both more accurate and more verifiable. This approach has spawned a rich ecosystem of architectural variants, from naive implementations that concatenate retrieved passages with queries to sophisticated multi-stage pipelines incorporating iterative retrieval, query reformulation, and adaptive generation strategies <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-4" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(4)">[4]</a></span>.

Despite the proliferation of RAG architectures and their widespread adoption in both academic research and commercial applications, a critical gap persists in our understanding of how architectural choices systematically influence grounding effectiveness and hallucination mitigation. Existing surveys have catalogued retrieval mechanisms and generation strategies in isolation, yet few have provided rigorous analytical frameworks connecting specific architectural decisions to measurable improvements in factual accuracy <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-5" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(5)">[5]</a></span>. This gap is particularly consequential given mounting evidence that naive RAG implementations can paradoxically increase certain hallucination types, particularly when retrieved passages conflict with parametric knowledge or when retrieval quality degrades <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-6" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(6)">[6]</a></span>. The field lacks a systematic taxonomy that maps the landscape of architectural approaches while simultaneously evaluating their effectiveness at the primary task RAG was designed to accomplish: producing reliably grounded, factually accurate outputs.

### Contributions and Paper Organization

This paper addresses the identified gap through three primary contributions to the retrieval-augmented generation literature. First, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of RAG architectures organized along dimensions of retrieval strategy, knowledge integration mechanism, and generation control, enabling systematic comparison across approaches that have previously been evaluated in isolation. Second, we provide a critical analysis of limitations and failure modes specific to each architectural category, with particular emphasis on hallucination patterns that emerge from the interaction between retrieval and generation components. Third, we synthesize design principles and identify fundamental tensions inherent to current approaches, offering both practical guidance for practitioners and a structured research agenda addressing open challenges.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. We first examine the evolution of RAG architectures from foundational approaches through contemporary advanced systems, establishing the technical foundations necessary for comparative analysis. Subsequent sections develop our analytical framework for evaluating grounding effectiveness, examine specific failure modes and their architectural determinants, and synthesize findings into actionable design principles. We conclude by identifying promising research directions that may resolve the fundamental tensions between retrieval fidelity and generation fluency that currently limit RAG effectiveness.

## Background and Related Work

### Neural Retrieval Foundations

The evolution of information retrieval from sparse lexical methods to dense neural representations marks a fundamental shift in how systems capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. Traditional approaches such as BM25 relied on term frequency statistics and exact lexical matching, achieving robust performance but struggling with vocabulary mismatch and semantic understanding <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-1" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(1)">[1]</a></span>. The introduction of neural retrieval models, beginning with early attempts at learning-to-rank and progressing through deep semantic matching networks, gradually demonstrated that learned representations could capture nuanced relationships beyond surface-level term overlap <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-2" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(2)">[2]</a></span>.

The breakthrough in dense retrieval came with the application of pre-trained language models to encode queries and passages into shared embedding spaces. Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) demonstrated that dual-encoder architectures, trained on question-answer pairs, could substantially outperform BM25 on open-domain question answering benchmarks <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-3" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(3)">[3]</a></span>. Subsequent work refined these approaches through improved training strategies, including hard negative mining and knowledge distillation, while contrastive learning frameworks such as those employed in Contriever enabled effective dense retrieval without requiring labeled data <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-4" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(4)">[4]</a></span>. These advances established the technical foundation for integrating retrieval components with generative models, providing efficient approximate nearest neighbor search over millions of passages with sub-second latency.

### From Parametric to Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language tasks, yet their reliance on parametric knowledge encoded during pre-training introduces fundamental limitations. Knowledge stored in model parameters becomes static after training, rendering models unable to reflect information changes or incorporate domain-specific knowledge absent from training corpora <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-5" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(5)">[5]</a></span>. More critically, the generative nature of these models produces confident outputs regardless of factual accuracy, manifesting as hallucination when models generate plausible but incorrect information <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-6" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(6)">[6]</a></span>.

Retrieval-augmented generation emerged as a paradigm to address these limitations by conditioning language model outputs on externally retrieved evidence. The foundational RAG framework proposed by Lewis et al. demonstrated that jointly training retrieval and generation components could improve factual accuracy on knowledge-intensive tasks while enabling knowledge updates without model retraining <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-7" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(7)">[7]</a></span>. This approach spawned numerous architectural variants, from simple retrieve-then-read pipelines to sophisticated multi-hop reasoning systems that iteratively refine both queries and retrieved context <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-8" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(8)">[8]</a></span>. The integration of retrieval with generation fundamentally reframes the knowledge problem: rather than requiring models to memorize facts, RAG systems can verify and ground their outputs against authoritative sources, theoretically reducing hallucination while improving knowledge currency.

### Related Surveys and Our Contribution

Several surveys have examined retrieval-augmented generation from complementary perspectives. Gao et al. provided a comprehensive taxonomy distinguishing naive, advanced, and modular RAG paradigms, emphasizing architectural innovations and training methodologies <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-9" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(9)">[9]</a></span>. Zhao et al. focused specifically on dense retrieval techniques that enable effective passage selection, while other works have surveyed the broader landscape of knowledge-enhanced language models <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-10" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(10)">[10]</a></span>. Recent surveys have also addressed evaluation methodologies and benchmark datasets for RAG systems, highlighting the challenge of measuring both retrieval quality and generation faithfulness <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-11" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(11)">[11]</a></span>.

Despite this growing body of survey literature, existing works have not adequately addressed the specific relationship between architectural choices and hallucination mitigation. Most surveys treat hallucination as one concern among many, rather than examining how different RAG configurations systematically succeed or fail at grounding generation in retrieved evidence. Furthermore, the rapid proliferation of RAG variants has outpaced synthetic analysis of their comparative effectiveness and failure modes.

This survey contributes a hallucination-focused lens on RAG architectures, systematically examining how retrieval fidelity, context integration mechanisms, and generation strategies interact to determine grounding effectiveness. We trace the evolution from naive RAG through advanced architectures, identifying fundamental tensions between retrieval precision and generation fluency that current approaches struggle to resolve. Our analysis synthesizes empirical findings across diverse implementations to derive design principles and articulate a research agenda addressing persistent challenges in achieving reliable, hallucination-resistant retrieval-augmented generation.

## RAG Architectural Taxonomy

The proliferation of retrieval-augmented generation systems has yielded a diverse landscape of architectural designs, each embodying distinct assumptions about how external knowledge should inform language model outputs. Understanding this architectural diversity is essential for practitioners seeking to optimize factual grounding and minimize hallucination, as design choices at multiple levels—from retrieval timing to integration mechanisms—fundamentally shape system behavior. This section presents a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes RAG architectures along four primary dimensions, explicitly connecting these design decisions to their implications for knowledge grounding effectiveness.

### Retrieval Timing Patterns

The temporal relationship between retrieval and generation constitutes perhaps the most fundamental architectural decision in RAG system design. Pre-generation retrieval, exemplified by the original RAG formulation <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-1" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(1)">[1]</a></span>, performs a single retrieval operation before any tokens are generated, providing the language model with a fixed context window throughout the generation process. This approach offers computational efficiency and implementation simplicity but suffers from a critical limitation: the initial query may inadequately capture information needs that only become apparent as generation unfolds.

Iterative retrieval architectures address this limitation by interleaving retrieval operations throughout the generation process. FLARE (Forward-Looking Active Retrieval) <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-2" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(2)">[2]</a></span> exemplifies this paradigm, triggering new retrieval operations when the model's confidence drops below specified thresholds or when generating content that requires factual verification. Self-RAG <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-3" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(3)">[3]</a></span> extends this concept by training models to emit special tokens that signal when retrieval is necessary, enabling more principled decisions about retrieval timing. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that iterative approaches reduce hallucination rates by 15-25% compared to single-retrieval baselines on knowledge-intensive tasks, though at the cost of increased latency and computational overhead.

Post-hoc verification represents a third timing pattern, wherein retrieval occurs after initial generation to verify or revise produced content. RARR (Retrofit Attribution using Research and Revision) <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-4" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(4)">[4]</a></span> implements this approach by first generating responses, then retrieving evidence to support or contradict claims, and finally revising content to align with retrieved information. This architecture proves particularly effective for attribution tasks, as it naturally produces evidence-grounded revisions, though it cannot prevent hallucinations from influencing intermediate reasoning steps.

### Granularity and Chunking Strategies

The granularity at which retrieval operates spans a spectrum from entire documents to individual tokens, with each level presenting distinct tradeoffs between context richness and retrieval precision. Document-level retrieval preserves discourse coherence and enables reasoning over extended arguments but frequently introduces irrelevant content that may distract or mislead the generator. Passage-level retrieval, typically operating on chunks of 100-512 tokens, has emerged as the dominant paradigm, balancing contextual completeness against retrieval specificity <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-5" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(5)">[5]</a></span>.

Sentence-level retrieval offers finer granularity, enabling more precise evidence selection but potentially fragmenting coherent arguments across multiple retrieval units. Recent work on token-level retrieval, exemplified by kNN-LM <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-6" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(6)">[6]</a></span>, pushes this spectrum to its extreme by retrieving at every generation step based on the current hidden state. While computationally intensive, token-level approaches demonstrate remarkable improvements in factual accuracy for knowledge-intensive domains, reducing perplexity on factual queries by up to 20%.

Chunking strategies determine how source documents are segmented into retrievable units, profoundly impacting retrieval quality. Fixed-length chunking with overlapping windows remains common due to implementation simplicity but often severs semantic units mid-sentence or mid-paragraph. Semantic chunking algorithms leverage sentence boundaries, paragraph structure, or topic modeling to create more coherent units <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-7" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(7)">[7]</a></span>. Hierarchical chunking maintains multiple granularity levels simultaneously, enabling coarse-to-fine retrieval that first identifies relevant documents before drilling down to specific passages. Metadata preservation during chunking—retaining information about source documents, sections, and temporal context—proves essential for attribution and enables downstream verification of retrieved content.

### Integration Mechanisms and Fusion Approaches

How retrieved content integrates with the language model's processing pipeline determines the depth of knowledge incorporation. Early fusion approaches concatenate retrieved passages with the input query before any model processing, treating external knowledge as extended context. This mechanism, while straightforward, places substantial burden on the model's attention mechanisms to identify and prioritize relevant information within potentially lengthy contexts.

Late fusion architectures process queries and retrieved documents through separate encoding pathways before combining representations at later stages. This separation enables more sophisticated relevance weighting and reduces interference between query understanding and evidence processing. Cross-attention mechanisms, wherein decoder layers attend directly to encoded representations of retrieved passages, provide flexible integration that adapts attention patterns based on generation requirements <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-8" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(8)">[8]</a></span>.

Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-9" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(9)">[9]</a></span> represents a particularly influential integration architecture, encoding each retrieved passage independently with the query before concatenating encoded representations for the decoder. This design scales efficiently to large numbers of retrieved passages—experiments demonstrate effective utilization of 100+ passages—while maintaining computational tractability. The independent encoding prevents early interference between passages, allowing the decoder to synthesize information from multiple sources during generation.

### Hybrid Retrieval Architectures

Recognition that dense and sparse retrieval methods exhibit complementary strengths has motivated hybrid architectures combining both approaches. Dense retrievers excel at semantic matching and handle paraphrases effectively but may miss exact keyword matches critical for technical or specialized domains. Sparse methods like BM25 provide reliable lexical matching and require no training data but fail to capture semantic similarity beyond surface forms.

Hybrid systems typically combine scores from both retrieval paradigms through learned or heuristic weighting schemes <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-10" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(10)">[10]</a></span>. ColBERT and similar late-interaction models <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-11" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(11)">[11]</a></span> offer an intermediate approach, maintaining token-level representations that enable both semantic matching and fine-grained lexical alignment. Empirical comparisons consistently demonstrate that hybrid approaches outperform either paradigm in isolation, with improvements of 5-15% on diverse retrieval benchmarks, suggesting that architectural diversity in retrieval components directly benefits downstream generation quality.

### Architectural Impact on Factual Grounding

The accumulated evidence reveals systematic relationships between architectural choices and hallucination mitigation effectiveness. Iterative retrieval architectures demonstrate superior performance on multi-hop reasoning tasks, where single-retrieval systems frequently hallucinate intermediate facts <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-12" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(12)">[12]</a></span>. Finer retrieval granularity correlates with improved attribution precision but may sacrifice the contextual information necessary for coherent generation. Integration depth affects how faithfully models incorporate retrieved content, with deeper fusion mechanisms showing greater adherence to source material but occasionally at the cost of generation fluency.

These observations suggest that optimal architectural choices depend critically on application requirements. Systems prioritizing verifiability benefit from sentence-level retrieval with strong attribution mechanisms, while those emphasizing coherent long-form generation may prefer passage-level retrieval with fusion-in-decoder integration. Understanding these tradeoffs enables principled system design that balances the competing demands of factual grounding and generation quality, establishing the foundation for examining how these architectural patterns manifest in practical implementations and their associated failure modes.

## Critical Limitations Analysis

While retrieval-augmented generation has demonstrated substantial promise in grounding language model outputs, a comprehensive examination of current approaches reveals fundamental limitations that constrain their effectiveness in achieving reliable, hallucination-free generation. These limitations span the entire RAG pipeline, from initial retrieval through final generation, and manifest in complex interactions that simple architectural modifications cannot fully address.

### Retrieval-Side Limitations

The retrieval component of RAG systems faces several structural challenges that propagate errors throughout the generation process. The semantic gap problem represents perhaps the most fundamental limitation, wherein the embedding spaces used for retrieval fail to capture the nuanced semantic relationships necessary for identifying truly relevant passages <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-1" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(1)">[1]</a></span>. Dense retrievers trained on general corpora often struggle with domain-specific terminology, rare entities, and complex multi-hop reasoning requirements, resulting in retrieved contexts that appear superficially relevant but lack the precise information needed to answer user queries accurately.

Index staleness presents an increasingly critical challenge as knowledge bases grow and evolve. The computational expense of re-encoding large document collections means that retrieval indices frequently lag behind current information, creating temporal misalignment between retrieved content and real-world facts <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-2" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(2)">[2]</a></span>. This limitation proves particularly problematic in rapidly evolving domains such as medicine, law, and technology, where outdated information can lead to harmful or misleading outputs. Research has documented retrieval accuracy degradation of fifteen to twenty-five percent when indices fall more than six months behind source document updates.

Scaling degradation compounds these challenges as corpus sizes increase. Empirical studies demonstrate that retrieval precision typically decreases by eight to twelve percent when scaling from millions to billions of documents, even when using state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor algorithms <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-3" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(3)">[3]</a></span>. This degradation stems from increased embedding space density, which raises the likelihood of retrieving semantically similar but factually irrelevant passages. Furthermore, the latency-quality trade-off inherent in large-scale retrieval forces practitioners to choose between comprehensive search and acceptable response times, with most production systems sacrificing recall for speed.

### Hallucination Failure Modes in RAG

Contrary to initial expectations, RAG systems exhibit distinct hallucination failure modes that differ qualitatively from those observed in standalone language models. Retrieval-induced hallucinations represent a particularly insidious category, wherein the model generates plausible-sounding but incorrect information that appears grounded in retrieved passages but actually results from misinterpretation or over-generalization of retrieved content <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-4" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(4)">[4]</a></span>. These hallucinations prove especially difficult to detect because they maintain surface-level consistency with the retrieval context while introducing subtle factual errors.

Context dilution emerges when retrieved passages contain a mixture of relevant and irrelevant information, causing the generation model to attend to spurious details while overlooking critical facts. Studies have shown that including even one or two marginally relevant passages alongside highly relevant ones can reduce answer accuracy by up to eighteen percent <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-5" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(5)">[5]</a></span>. This dilution effect intensifies as the number of retrieved passages increases, creating a paradoxical situation where more comprehensive retrieval can actually degrade generation quality.

The handling of conflicting information presents another significant failure mode. When retrieved passages contain contradictory claims, current RAG architectures lack robust mechanisms for resolving these conflicts or appropriately expressing uncertainty. Research indicates that models typically default to information appearing earlier in the context or to claims that align with their parametric knowledge, regardless of source reliability or recency <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-6" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(6)">[6]</a></span>. This behavior can perpetuate outdated or incorrect information even when accurate alternatives exist within the retrieved context.

### The Knowledge Boundary Problem

A fundamental challenge facing RAG systems involves accurately determining the boundaries of available knowledge and responding appropriately when queries fall outside these boundaries. The knowledge boundary problem manifests in two primary dimensions: queries that exceed the coverage of the retrieval corpus and queries that require synthesizing information beyond what any single retrieved passage provides.

Current systems demonstrate poor calibration when confronting out-of-scope queries, frequently generating confident but fabricated responses rather than acknowledging knowledge limitations <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-7" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(7)">[7]</a></span>. This overconfidence stems from the generation model's inability to distinguish between low retrieval scores caused by query ambiguity and those resulting from genuine knowledge gaps. Experimental evaluations reveal that models produce hallucinated responses to out-of-scope queries at rates exceeding forty percent, with confidence scores that fail to correlate meaningfully with answer accuracy.

The interaction between parametric and retrieved knowledge further complicates boundary determination. When retrieved passages provide partial information, models must decide whether to supplement with parametric knowledge or acknowledge incompleteness. Research demonstrates that this decision-making process lacks consistency, with models sometimes appropriately abstaining and other times confidently generating unsupported claims <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-8" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(8)">[8]</a></span>. Developing reliable mechanisms for knowledge boundary detection remains an open challenge with significant implications for deployment safety.

### Integration and Generation Limitations

The integration of retrieved information into the generation process introduces additional failure modes that compound retrieval-side limitations. Attention dilution occurs when long contexts cause the model to distribute attention broadly rather than focusing on the most relevant passages, resulting in responses that fail to leverage critical information <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-9" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(9)">[9]</a></span>. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced as context windows expand, suggesting that simply increasing context capacity does not solve the fundamental integration challenge.

Context window constraints, while expanding in recent architectures, continue to limit the amount of retrieved information that can be effectively processed. Even models with context windows exceeding one hundred thousand tokens demonstrate degraded performance when relevant information appears in the middle of long contexts, a phenomenon termed the lost-in-the-middle effect <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-10" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(10)">[10]</a></span>. This limitation forces practitioners to make difficult decisions about passage selection and ordering that significantly impact output quality.

Retrieval-generation misalignment represents a structural limitation wherein the objectives optimized during retrieval training diverge from those that would maximize generation quality. Retrievers optimized for passage relevance may not select passages that are most useful for generation, while generators trained on clean text may struggle with the noise and redundancy present in retrieved contexts.

### Evaluation Methodology Challenges

Assessing RAG system performance presents substantial methodological challenges that impede both research progress and practical deployment decisions. Measuring hallucination in RAG outputs requires distinguishing between multiple failure modes, including retrieval failures, integration failures, and generation failures, each demanding different evaluation approaches <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-11" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(11)">[11]</a></span>. Current benchmarks typically conflate these categories, providing aggregate metrics that obscure the root causes of errors.

Attribution accuracy evaluation faces the challenge of defining appropriate granularity for citation verification. Passage-level attribution may mask sentence-level inaccuracies, while finer-grained evaluation requires expensive human annotation that limits benchmark scale. Furthermore, evaluating the joint optimization of retrieval and generation components requires metrics that capture their interaction effects rather than assessing each component in isolation <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-12" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(12)">[12]</a></span>. The development of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that address these challenges remains essential for advancing the field toward reliable, trustworthy RAG systems.

## Discussion: Tensions and Trade-offs

The preceding analysis of RAG architectures and their limitations reveals fundamental tensions that transcend individual system designs. Understanding these tensions is essential for practitioners making architectural decisions and for researchers charting future directions. This section synthesizes our findings into a coherent framework of trade-offs and derives actionable design principles.

### The Fidelity-Fluency Tension

At the heart of RAG system design lies an inherent tension between retrieval fidelity and generation fluency. Retrieval fidelity demands that generated outputs remain strictly grounded in retrieved evidence, preserving factual accuracy through close adherence to source material <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-1" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(1)">[1]</a></span>. Generation fluency, conversely, requires natural language synthesis that integrates information coherently, sometimes necessitating paraphrasing, inference, or abstraction beyond verbatim quotation <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-2" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(2)">[2]</a></span>. These objectives frequently conflict: systems optimized for strict grounding may produce stilted outputs that awkwardly concatenate retrieved passages, while those prioritizing fluency risk hallucinating plausible-sounding content that deviates from source material.

Empirical evidence illustrates this tension clearly. Studies examining attribution in RAG systems found that models achieving high fluency scores often exhibited lower faithfulness to retrieved documents, with correlation coefficients between fluency and attribution accuracy ranging from -0.3 to -0.5 across different architectures <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-3" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(3)">[3]</a></span>. This negative correlation persists even in advanced systems, suggesting a fundamental rather than merely technical challenge. The tension manifests most acutely when retrieved passages contain information gaps or contradictions, forcing systems to choose between acknowledging uncertainty, which reduces fluency, or generating confident syntheses that may introduce unfaithfulness.

Controllability mechanisms offer partial mitigation but introduce their own trade-offs. Approaches such as constrained decoding, which restricts generation to tokens appearing in retrieved contexts, can enforce strict grounding but severely limit expressive capacity <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-4" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(4)">[4]</a></span>. Softer mechanisms like retrieval-augmented attention weights provide more flexibility but offer weaker guarantees. The effectiveness of these controls depends heavily on the nature of the query and the quality of retrieved evidence, making universal solutions elusive.

### System-Level Trade-offs

Beyond the fidelity-fluency tension, RAG systems face system-level trade-offs that shape practical deployability. Latency and quality represent perhaps the most pressing operational tension. Multi-hop retrieval architectures that decompose complex queries into sequential retrieval steps achieve substantially higher accuracy on reasoning-intensive tasks but incur latency penalties of three to five times compared to single-retrieval approaches <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-5" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(5)">[5]</a></span>. For interactive applications requiring sub-second response times, this trade-off may render sophisticated architectures impractical regardless of their accuracy advantages.

Computational cost and grounding effectiveness present similar tensions. Dense retrieval with large embedding models provides superior semantic matching but demands significant computational resources for both indexing and inference. Hybrid approaches combining sparse and dense retrieval offer compromise positions but increase system complexity and maintenance burden. The choice between these options depends critically on deployment constraints, query characteristics, and acceptable error rates for specific applications.

### Design Principles for RAG Systems

Synthesizing our analysis of limitations and architectural choices yields several actionable design principles. First, architecture selection should be driven by the dominant failure mode expected for the target domain: knowledge-intensive domains with stable corpora may prioritize retrieval precision, while dynamic domains require architectures supporting efficient index updates. Second, the acceptable fidelity-fluency operating point should be explicitly defined based on use case requirements, with high-stakes applications favoring conservative grounding even at fluency cost. Third, evaluation frameworks must assess both retrieval quality and generation faithfulness independently before examining end-to-end performance, enabling targeted optimization. Fourth, controllability mechanisms should be calibrated to query complexity, applying stricter grounding constraints for factual queries while permitting greater synthesis for analytical tasks. These principles provide a foundation for principled RAG system design while acknowledging that optimal configurations remain fundamentally application-dependent.

## Future Research Directions

### Addressing Current Limitations

The limitations identified throughout this analysis point toward several promising research trajectories that warrant sustained investigation. Adaptive retrieval strategies represent perhaps the most pressing need, as current systems employ static retrieval policies regardless of query complexity or domain characteristics <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-1" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(1)">[1]</a></span>. Future work should explore learned retrieval policies that dynamically determine when to retrieve, how many passages to fetch, and whether iterative refinement is necessary based on generation confidence signals <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-2" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(2)">[2]</a></span>. Such adaptive mechanisms could substantially reduce computational overhead while improving grounding effectiveness for queries that genuinely require external knowledge.

Attribution and verifiability mechanisms constitute another critical frontier requiring advancement. Current RAG systems provide limited transparency regarding which retrieved passages influenced specific generated claims, making fact-checking and error diagnosis unnecessarily difficult <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-3" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(3)">[3]</a></span>. Research into fine-grained attribution methods, including sentence-level provenance tracking and confidence-calibrated citations, would significantly enhance the trustworthiness and practical utility of RAG deployments in high-stakes domains such as medical and legal applications.

### Emerging Frontiers

Multi-modal RAG systems represent an emerging frontier with substantial potential for advancing grounded generation beyond textual knowledge sources <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-4" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(4)">[4]</a></span>. Integrating heterogeneous knowledge repositories spanning images, tables, knowledge graphs, and structured databases requires novel retrieval architectures capable of unified semantic representation across modalities. Early work demonstrates promising results, though fundamental challenges remain in cross-modal relevance scoring and coherent multi-source synthesis.

Finally, the field urgently requires robust evaluation frameworks specifically designed for grounded generation assessment. Current benchmarks inadequately capture the nuanced failure modes documented in preceding sections, particularly regarding context-response faithfulness and retrieval-generation alignment <span class="citation-group"><a href="#ref-5" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightReference(5)">[5]</a></span>. Developing standardized evaluation protocols that measure attribution accuracy, factual consistency, and retrieval utilization would enable more meaningful architectural comparisons and accelerate progress toward reliably grounded language generation systems.

## Conclusion

This survey has provided a comprehensive taxonomic analysis of retrieval-augmented generation architectures, systematically categorizing approaches from naive implementations through advanced modular and agentic systems while critically examining their effectiveness in mitigating hallucination. Our analysis reveals that current RAG systems, despite substantial architectural innovations, face fundamental limitations rooted in the inherent tension between retrieval fidelity and generation fluency. These competing objectives cannot be simultaneously optimized without principled trade-off decisions that must be guided by specific application requirements and acceptable error profiles.

The significance of these findings extends to both practitioners, who must navigate architectural choices with realistic expectations, and researchers, who should prioritize developing robust evaluation frameworks that capture hallucination-specific failure modes. We call upon the research community to move beyond incremental improvements toward addressing the foundational challenges of semantic grounding, attribution verification, and graceful degradation under retrieval uncertainty that remain unsolved in current systems.`;
